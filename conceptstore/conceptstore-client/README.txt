This is a client project that allows the user to use the knowledgebase as a java library.

1. Copy the knowledgebase folder to your local HDD.
2. Set the absolute path of this folder, generally called the "graph.db" in the ConceptstoreClient class DB_PATH constant. e.g. for mac users "graph.db=/Users/bhsingh/Desktop/graph.db"
3. See the ConceptstoreClient java class's "main" method on how to retrieve the graph repositories and perform operations.
