TI  - Flow-mediated dilation in 9- to 11-year-old children: the influence of intrauterine and childhood factors.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early life factors, particularly size at birth, may influence later risk of cardiovascular disease, but a mechanism for this influence has not been established. We have examined the relation between birth weight and endothelial function (a key event in atherosclerosis) in a population-based study of children, taking into account classic cardiovascular risk factors in childhood. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 333 British children aged 9 to 11 years in whom information on birth weight, maternal factors, and risk factors (including blood pressure, lipid fractions, preload and postload glucose levels, smoking exposure, and socioeconomic status) was available. A noninvasive ultrasound technique was used to assess the ability of the brachial artery to dilate in response to increased blood flow (induced by forearm cuff occlusion and release), an endothelium-dependent response. Birth weight showed a significant, graded, positive association with flow-mediated dilation (0.027 mm/kg; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.051 mm/kg; P=.02). Childhood cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, total and LDL cholesterol, and salivary cotinine level) showed no relation with flow-mediated dilation, but HDL cholesterol level was inversely related (-0.067 mm/mmol; 95% CI, -0.021 to -0.113 mm/mmol; P=.005). The relation between birth weight and flow-mediated dilation was not affected by adjustment for childhood body build, parity, cardiovascular risk factors, social class, or ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Low birth weight is associated with impaired endothelial function in childhood, a key early event in atherogenesis. Growth in utero may be associated with long-term changes in vascular function that are manifest by the first decade of life and that may influence the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Psychological distress among women with recurrent spontaneous abortion.  
AB  - Fifty-seven of 100 women with recurrent abortion completed questionnaires designed to assess demographic and reproductive variables, depression, anxiety, social desirability, self-esteem, locus of control, and marital adjustment. The results indicated that 32% of the women could be classified as depressed. The subjects also reported higher than average levels of acute and chronic anxiety. Fifty-three percent of the subjects reported below average marital adjustment. Post hoc analyses indicated that the women who had a previous elective abortion had higher levels of anxiety, lower marital adjustment, and different attributions regarding their pregnancy losses than the women who had not had an elective abortion. Having a living child was not a protective buffer against psychological distress.

TI  - Child mortality in Goa: a cross-sectional analysis.  
AB  - This paper is a study of the determinants of child mortality in the relatively developed Indian state of Goa. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS, 1992-93) conducted in the state of Goa have been used to examine the child mortality experiences of 1,331 women who were within a marriage lasting 15 years. An aggregated index of child mortality, which summarizes the mortality experiences of a woman with exposure adjustment, is the study variable. Maternal education and longer birth spacing were found to lower child mortality risks significantly.

TI  - Three-year trials of personal therapy among schizophrenic patients living with or independent of family, II: Effects on adjustment of patients.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous analyses of the personal and social adjustment of outpatients with schizophrenia have either relied on the assessment of unrepresentative patients who survived without relapse or used analyses that included relapse assessments, a potential confound when different rates of relapse existed among treatment conditions. The authors' goal was to conduct a study of the effects of personal therapy on outcome that was designed to take into consideration the effects of relapse. METHOD: They evaluated the effectiveness of personal therapy over 3 years after hospital discharge among 151 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The patients were randomly assigned to receive personal therapy or contrasting therapies in one of two concurrent trials. One trial included patients who were living with family (N = 97); the other included patients who were living independent of family (N = 54). Patients were assessed at 6-month intervals over 3 years of treatment on measures of personal and social adjustment; patients who relapsed and restabilized and those who did not relapse were included. RESULTS: Personal therapy had positive effects on broad components of social adjustment (role performance) but had few differential effects on symptoms, and patients receiving personal therapy remained more anxious than patients who received family or supportive therapy. For patients who were living with family, personal therapy led to better outcomes in overall performance than did the other treatments. Although family therapy had only one positive effect on patients' social adjustment, the personal adjustment (residual symptoms) of patients who received family therapy appeared to improve more than that of patients receiving personal or supportive therapy. For patients not living with family, personal therapy was more successful than supportive therapy in improving work performance and relationships out of the home. Longitudinal effects of personal therapy on symptoms were similar to those of family and supportive therapies, particularly in the first 2 years, but personal therapy effect sizes increased over time on measures of social adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Personal therapy has pervasive effects on the social adjustment of patients with schizophrenia that are independent of relapse prevention. Supportive therapy, with or without family intervention, produces adjustment effects that peak at 12 months after discharge and plateau thereafter. However, personal therapy, a definitive psychosocial intervention, continues to improve the social adjustment of patients in the second and third years after discharge. Brief treatment would appear to be less effective than a long-term, disorder-relevant intervention for schizophrenia.

TI  - Gait pattern alteration by functional sensory substitution in healthy subjects and in diabetic subjects with peripheral neuropathy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of diabetic and nondiabetic individuals to learn to use a lower extremity sensory substitution device to cue gait pattern changes. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Gait laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty diabetic persons and 20 age- and education-matched nondiabetic controls responded to advertisements for study participation. INTERVENTION: Participants walked on a treadmill at three speeds (1, 2, and 2.5mph) with auditory sensory feedback to cue ground contact greater than 80% duration of baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The variables measured included gait cycle (steps per minute) and number of times per minute that any step during a trial exceeded 80% duration of ground contacted compared with a measured baseline step length for each speed. RESULTS: Persons in both groups were able to rapidly and significantly alter their gait patterns in response to signals from the sensory substitution device, by changing their gait cycles (nondiabetic group, F(17,124) = 5.27, p < .001; diabetic group, F(5,172) = 3.45, p < .001). Post hoc analyses showed early gait cycle modification and error reduction among both groups. The nondiabetic group learned to use the device significantly more quickly than the diabetic group during the slow (1mph, t = 3.57, p < .001) and average (2mph, t = 2.97, p < .05) trials. By the fast (2.5mph) ambulation trial, both groups were performing equally, suggesting a rapid rate of adjustment to the device. No technical failures from gait trainer malfunction occurred during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic persons with neuropathy effectively used lower extremity sensory substitution, and the technology is now available to manufacture a durable, effective lower extremity sensory substitution system.

TI  - Diet, body size, physical activity, and the risk of endometrial cancer.  
AB  - Endometrial cancer is associated with increased weight and body size, diabetes, and other conditions that may result from an excess in calories or lack of physical activity. Although a few studies have explored the effect of dietary constituents on the risk of endometrial cancer, the nature of the joint association of these constituents and obesity, energy intake, or energy expenditure with risk is unknown. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Hawaii to examine the association of diet, body size, and physical activity with the risk of endometrial cancer. Subjects included 332 histologically confirmed, primary endometrial cancer cases and 511 controls identified between 1985 and 1993. Cases and controls were residents of Oahu, Hawaii who were between 18 and 84 years of age and were from one of the following ethnic groups: Japanese, Caucasian, Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Chinese. Cases were identified through the Hawaii Tumor Registry and matched to the controls on age (+/-2.5 years) and ethnicity. In-person interviews, conducted in the subjects' homes, included dietary, reproductive, menstrual, and medical histories and use of exogenous hormones, physical activity, and other lifestyle variables. Weight, girth, and skinfold measurements were taken at the time of the interview. We found a strong dose-response relation of increased body size to the development of endometrial cancer after adjustment for energy intake. The odds ratio (OR) for endometrial cancer among women in the highest quartile of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was more than four times that among women in the lowest quartile. Waist, hip, midarm, and wrist girths were positively associated with the estimated risk of endometrial cancer after adjustment for total calories and other nondietary risk factors, although the trends in the ORs were attenuated after adjustment for BMI. Physically active women had a modest reduction in their risk of disease compared with inactive women. Cases consumed a greater percentage of their calories from fat and a lower percentage of their calories from carbohydrates than did controls. Adjustment for BMI reduced the ORs for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of fat calorie intake from 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.2) to 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.6), suggesting that part of the association is explained by obesity. There was a differential effect of fat on endometrial cancer according to BMI. For all components of fat, the associations with endometrial cancer were either minimal or absent among leaner women (i.e., those with BMI below the median), whereas, among more obese women, two-fold differences in risk were observed between women above and below the median of fat intake. Foods that are high in fat and cholesterol, such as red meat, margarine, and eggs, were positively associated with endometrial cancer, whereas cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, particularly those high in lutein, were inversely associated. These findings suggest that women who avoid being overweight and who consume a diet low in plant and animal fats and high in complex carbohydrates are at a reduced risk of endometrial cancer.

TI  - The transition to nursing home life: a comparison of planned and unplanned admissions.  
AB  - The percentage of elderly people in nursing homes increases with age from 7% for adults aged 75-84 years to 20% for those over 85 years old. Limited research has been done with elderly people whose admission to a nursing home was planned or unplanned. This study addressed: what are the initial experiences of elderly people in making the transition to nursing home life when the admission was planned or unplanned? A grounded theory approach using constant comparative methods was used to discover the process and patterns of transition to nursing home life. Data were collected 24 hours after admission and every other day for 2 weeks, and 1 month post-admission using in-depth semistructured interviews and field notes. Data analysis demonstrated that the transition to nursing home life occurred in three phases: overwhelmed, adjustment and initial acceptance phase. The phases of adjustment are discussed along with interventions to assist older adults in making this transition.

TI  - Acid-base regulation in tadpoles of Rana catesbeiana exposed to environmental hypercapnia.  
AB  - Tadpoles of Rana catesbeiana were exposed to different levels of environmental hypercapnia. The acid-base regulatory response differed from that in adult amphibians in showing a high degree of pH compensation in the extracellular fluid (65-85%) and complete compensation in the intracellular fluid (tail muscle and liver) within 24 h. Hypercapnia induced a massive transfer of HCO3- equivalents and Ca2+ from the tadpoles to the environment, which lasted some 4-6 h. Bicarbonate accumulated in the body fluids came mainly from internal buffer sources (probably CaCO3 in lime sacs and/or skin deposits). It is suggested that the large bicarbonate efflux from the animal is a consequence of the dissolution of CaCO3 stores and the delayed adjustment of bicarbonate-retaining mechanisms. Re-exposure of tadpoles to hypercapnia after 1-3 weeks of normocapnic recovery only affected transepithelial fluxes of acid-base equivalents marginally, suggesting that mobilisable CaCO3 stores were depleted during the first exposure to hypercapnia and that they were not refilled. The CaCO3 stores may normally be mobilised during the slowly developing internal hypercapnia that occurs during metamorphosis.

TI  - Lay diagnosis and health-care-seeking behaviour for chest pain in south Asians and Europeans.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: South Asian people in the UK experience greater delays than Europeans in obtaining appropriate specialist management for heart disease, but the causes are not known. We investigated whether south Asians and Europeans interpret and act upon anginal symptoms differently. METHODS: We randomly selected 2000 people from general practitioners' (family physicians) lists in London, UK, to receive a questionnaire that included a short fictional case history of an individual with possible anginal pain and asked how respondents would react to experiencing it. A second questionnaire seeking information on medical history, attitudes to health, and demography was sent later. The main outcome measure was the proportion who said they would seek immediate care (hospital emergency department or general practitioner) for the pain described in the case scenario. FINDINGS: The rate of response to both questionnaires was 60.2% (903 of 1500 who received both), 553 responders were of European origin, 124 were Hindu, and 235 were Sikh. There were no differences between the ethnic groups in the proportion identifying the pain as cardiac, but south Asians would be more anxious about the pain than would Europeans. Of the men, 55 (23%) Europeans, 20 (38%) Hindus, and 52 (47%) Sikhs said they would seek immediate care (p < 0.0001 for heterogeneity); of women, 77 (24%), 25 (35%), and 58 (46%), respectively, would seek immediate care (p < 0.0001).  After adjustment for confounding variables the odds ratio for seeking immediate care in Hindus compared with Europeans was 2.67 (95% CI 1.49-4.73) and that for Sikhs compared with Europeans was 3.18 (1.98-5.12). INTERPRETATION: Hindus and Sikhs reported a greater likelihood of seeking immediate care for anginal symptoms than Europeans; this finding indicates that barriers to cardiology services for south Asians are unrelated to difficulties in interpretations of symptoms or willingness to seek care. Improvement of awareness of heart disease may not decrease delays in obtaining care. Service-related explanations must be explored, such as general practitioners' difficulties in arriving at a diagnosis or differences in management because of ethnic origin.

TI  - A field study of stress and fatigue in long-distance bus drivers.  
AB  - Psychophysiological changes during long-distance driving may be associated with driving fatigue and morbidity. Measures of stress and arousal, including heart rate, blood pressure, catecholamines, cortisol, state anxiety, and self-ratings of stress and arousal were collected from 10 long-distance bus drivers during 12-hour driving shifts and at matched times on nondriving rest days. Cardiovascular and catecholamine data were elevated across the entire work day, compared with rest days. Self-reported stress and state anxiety were elevated only at the preshift measure, and these elevations were interpreted as the result of anticipatory anxiety and additional work demands at the beginning of the shift. Decelerating activation from the 9th to the 12th hours of driving were reflected in slower heart rate and lower subjective arousal ratings. Suggested explanations for these findings are that drivers experience a release of tension when they anticipate the end of the shift and therefore deactivation is a signal or precursor to the onset of fatigue in physiological adjustment mechanisms.

TI  - Weapons injuries during and after periods of conflict: retrospective analysis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative frequency of weapon injuries during conflict and after periods of conflict in the absence of disarmament. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a database of war wounds. SETTING: Region with a protracted conflict between rival combatant groups and a subsequent transition to the uncontested military authority of a single power. SUBJECTS: 2332 people who received weapons injuries during the conflict or post-conflict periods and were admitted to hospital within 24 hours of injury. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage change in mean monthly admission rate by weapon type between conflict and post-conflict periods; annual incidence of injury by weapon type during conflict and post-conflict periods; percentage change in annual incidence by weapon type between conflict and post-conflict periods. RESULTS: Mean monthly admission rates for injuries from fragmentation munitions decreased by 8% between conflict and post-conflict periods and by 23% for injuries from mines and 32% for gunshot injuries. The decline in admissions for all injuries was 23%.  After adjustment for population growth over the study period, declines in annual incidence were 22% for fragmentation munitions injuries, 34% for mine injuries, and 40% for gunshot injuries. The decline in incidence for all injuries was 33%. In-hospital mortality from weapons related injuries increased from 2.5% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) between conflict and post-conflict periods. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, continued availability of weapons is associated with increased mortality and a level of injuries from weapons that is only somewhat reduced from that observed during a period of conflict.

TI  - Influence of physiological factors on the age-related increase in blood pressure in healthy men.  
AB  - The independent and collective influences of several physiological factors on the age-related increase in blood pressure in healthy men were examined. Twenty-seven younger and 25 older, mostly normotensive, healthy men were studied. Blood pressure, body fat, body fat distribution, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), plasma norepinephrine, dietary Na, and erythrocyte Na-K pump activity were measured. Older men showed 57% higher percent body fat, 40% higher plasma norepinephrine concentration, 14% greater mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and 5% higher plasma K concentration than younger men (all p < 0.01). Older men showed a 38% (p < 0.01) lower VO2max, 19% (p < 0.05) lower energy intake, 18% (p < 0.05) lower Na-K pump rate constant, and a 17% (p < 0.05) lower Na-K pump rate. Group means for MAP were adjusted for combinations of plasma norepinephrine, waist:thigh ratio, VO2max, and the Na-K pump rate constant, to determine if any one variable or combination could account for the age related increase in MAP.  Statistical adjustment for plasma norepinephrine, waist:thigh ratio, and Na-K pump rate constant eliminated the significant difference between MAPs for the two groups. Thus, alterations in sympathetic nervous system activity, body fat distribution, and the membrane Na-K pump activity independently contribute to the age-related increase in MAP in healthy men.

TI  - Seasonal variation in fibrinogen in the Rotterdam Study.  
AB  - As evidence accumulates to implicate fibrinogen as a risk indicator for cardiovascular disease, it is of interest to study its seasonal variation. A population based cross-sectional study was performed among participants of the Rotterdam Study, a cohort of 7,983 men and women, aged 55 years and over. Fibrinogen levels were measured by the prothrombin time derived method in the first 2,325 participants of the study. Fibrinogen levels were considerably higher in winter. The seasonal difference was 0.34 g/l (95% confidence interval 0.29, 0.39) and was more pronounced in subjects aged 75 years and over than in subjects aged 55 to 75 years, 0.43 g/l (0.34, 0.52) and 0.29 g/l (0.24, 0.35), respectively.  Additional adjustment for body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total and HDL cholesterol did not materially change the findings. After adjustment for seasons, outdoor temperature was not associated with fibrinogen. Adjustment for outdoor temperature did not change the seasonal variation of fibrinogen, seasonal difference 0.31 g/l (0.24, 0.37). In conclusion, fibrinogen levels are highest in Winter. The seasonal variation of fibrinogen is more pronounced in the elderly. Outdoor temperature does not seem to play a role in the seasonal variation of fibrinogen. Seasonal variation of fibrinogen may partly explain the increased cardiovascular disease mortality in Winter.

TI  - Coping behaviors at diagnosis and in adjustment one year later in children with diabetes.  
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to determine the contributions of coping behaviors used at diagnosis to medical (metabolic control) and psychosocial adjustment (self-perceived competence; adjustment) 1 year later. A total of 89 children (8 to 14 years of age; 48% male; 59% White) received follow-up quarterly from diabetes diagnosis to 1 year later. Findings indicated that, in general, although metabolic control worsened over the first year, psychosocial status and coping behaviors were stable. Boys had worse metabolic control than girls. Multiple regression analysis indicated that self-worth at 1 year postdiagnosis was associated with less use of spirituality (beta = -.44), more use of humor (beta = .28), and more positive self-care (beta = .28); and self-care was less likely to be positive in older children (r = .32). These variables accounted for 47% of the variance (39% adjusted) in general self-worth when entry self-worth was controlled. Poorer overall adjustment at 1 year postdiagnosis was associated with more use of avoidance behaviors (beta = -.47) and poorer self-care (beta = -.71); and more use of avoidance was associated with older age. These variables accounted for 62% of the variance (58% adjusted) in adjustment when adjustment at diagnosis was controlled. Poorer metabolic control was associated with more use of avoidance (beta = .30) and female gender (beta = .39), and avoidance behaviors were more common in older children (beta = .12). This model predicted 33% of the variance (25% adjusted) in metabolic control 1 year after diagnosis.

Twenty two of these patients had a pyloroplasty and fifteen had no drainage procedure. All these patients were subjected to a dumping provocation test. Evidence of dumping was noted in four patients, all having a pyloroplasty. Clinically, these four patients had mild symptoms which improved with dietary adjustment. We conclude that dumping does occur following thoracic transposition of the stomach and seems to occur more in patients with pyloroplasty than those without it.

TI  - Interobserver agreement for 10% categories of angiographic carotid stenosis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the reliability of the assessment of severe 70% to 99% carotid stenosis by carotid angiography has been proven excellent, this may not necessarily be the case for a more detailed classification of carotid stenoses by 10% categories. METHODS: Angiograms of the carotid arteries were assessed pairwise by three independent, experienced observers. The measurements of the degree of stenosis of both the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid artery were made according to the European Carotid Surgery Trial method. Kappa statistics were used to assess the agreement beyond chance for severe (70% to 99%) carotid stenosis (kappa 1) and for 10% categories of carotid stenosis (kappa 2). The penalty scores were adjusted by weights for the relative difference in risk (RDR) of stroke in the ipsilateral carotid distribution between the 10% categories (kappa 3). An adjustment of the RDR method was made by assuming that only patients with a severe carotid stenosis would undergo surgery, and the penalty would be 0 if no disagreement would exist about the indication for surgery (kappa 4).  An even further adjustment (kappa 5) was made by assuming that assessment of the rate of carotid stenosis by one or both observers would lead to different treatment recommendations in 50% of the cases, and accordingly the penalty for disagreement (RDR) was halved. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one carotid bifurcations in 65 patients with a transient ischemic attack or nondisabling stroke were assessed. The intraclass correlation between the exact estimates of carotid stenosis was .90 (95% confidence interval, .85 to .92). The mean difference in stenosis between the two raters was 0.8% (95% confidence interval, -2.1% to 3.7%). kappa 1 to kappa 5 equaled 0.80, 0.40, 0.79, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement for distinct 10% categories of angiographic carotid stenosis is moderate, but when realistic risk- and decision-based weights are used, agreement between experienced observers can be almost perfect.

TI  - ROESY with water flip back for high-field NMR of biomolecules.  
AB  - We report a version of the ROESY experiment in which saturation of the water magnetization is avoided without compromising suppression of the water signal during acquisition. Field gradient and selective RF pulses are used to maintain precise control of the water magnetization throughout the experiment and avoid signal losses due to radiation damping and molecular diffusion effects. The pulse sequence includes a delay for intentional radiation damping prior to mixing period. The optimal length of this delay is field and sample dependent, but easily determined from the apparent linewidth of the water signal. NOESY and TOCSY variants of the same experiment are presented which make use of identical manipulations of the water magnetization. The three pulse sequences constitute a suite for which little parameter adjustment is required once one of the experiments has been configured. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

TI  - Heparin dosing for percutaneous coronary angioplasty: use of body surface area to improve initial activated clotting time values.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated clotting time (ACT) values during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) after the initial 10,000 U heparin bolus are often below target values of 350 or 400 s (Hemochron) and have to be supplemented with additional heparin. This study evaluated the initial 10 min post-heparin bolus clotting time value using a body surface area (BSA)-adjusted heparin bolus versus the traditional 10,000 U heparin bolus. HYPOTHESIS: Body surface area adjustment of initial heparin dosing prior to PTCA will be more effective in reaching target ACT values compared with the 10,000 U heparin bolus method. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients receiving the BSA-adjusted heparin bolus were compared with 27 age- and gender-matched controls who had received the traditional heparin bolus. The adjusted heparin bolus formula used was [BSA(m2)/1.3m2] x 10,000 U of heparin. RESULTS: The success rate at reaching the target value of 400 s was 13 of 27 (48.1%) and 2 of 27 (7.4%) for the BSA-guided and 10,000 U heparin-guided groups, respectively (p < 0.01). The success rate at reaching the 350 s target value was 25 of 27 (92.6%) and 6 of 27 (22.2%) for the BSA-guided and 10,000 U heparin-guided groups, respectively (p < 0.01). The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in success between the BSA-guided and 10,000 U heparin-guided groups were 0.19-0.62 and 0.52-0.89 for the 400 s and 350 s ACT targets, respectively. CONCLUSION: Body surface area adjustment of initial heparin dosing is a more effective method of reaching the initial ACT target values of 350 and 400 s compared with the traditional method prior to PTCA. This conclusion applies to the Hemochron ACT device and arterial samples, and adjustments may need to be made for other devices and/or venous samples.

TI  - Classroom peer acceptance, friendship, and victimization: distinct relational systems that contribute uniquely to children's school adjustment?  
AB  - The proposition that relationships make differential (i.e., unique, redundant, contingent) contributions to adjustment was examined by investigating the linkages between children's participation in different types of peer relationships (i.e., friendship, peer acceptance, peer victimization) and their adjustment to school. Relationship measures were gathered for 5- to 6-year-old children (105 males, 95 females) twice during kindergarten (i.e., fall and spring) and were correlated with adjustment indicators at each time of assessment and used to predict changes in school adjustment over time. Examination of the relative associations between the relationship measures and children's adjustment revealed evidence of both unshared (i.e., unique) and shared (i.e., redundant) linkages, depending on the form of adjustment examined. These findings suggest that adjustment may be influenced by the diverse experiences (i.e., provisions) that children encounter in different forms of relationship, and that certain types of relationships may have greater or lesser adaptive significance depending on the adjustment outcome examined.

TI  - Validity of subjective assessment of changes in respiratory health status: a 30 year epidemiological study of workers in Paris.  
AB  - The validity of scales used for subjective assessment of health, particularly transitional indices, is under discussion. The aim of the present study was to assess the concurrent and predictive validity of a simple estimate of long-term subjective assessment of respiratory health changes. A longitudinal study of 915 workers was conducted over 30 yrs, with both retrospective self-assessment of respiratory health changes and objective measurements of spirometric values 12 yrs apart. An assessment of the reason for death during the subsequent 20 yrs was performed. Subjective assessment of respiratory deterioration over 12 yrs was significantly related to both cross-sectional lung function values and longitudinal lung function changes (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) decline), an association which remained after adjustment for FEV1 level. It was also related to the same risk factors as decline in FEV1 (smoking, occupational exposure). Self-evaluation of respiratory deterioration was significantly predictive of death from all causes, with the highest (but nonsignificant) rate ratio for respiratory causes. Asthmatics exhibited greater long-term variability (objective and subjective) than nonasthmatics. Independent of dyspnoea, self-assessment of respiratory health deterioration was significantly related to FEV1. Subjective assessment of long-term changes in respiratory health provides valid information.

TI  - Familial resemblance for abdominal visceral fat: the HERITAGE family study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Abdominal visceral fat (AVF) is considered a risk factor for diabetes, atherogenic lipid profiles and hypertension. However, little is known about the genetic contribution to AVF as compared to total body fat. DESIGN: AVF was assessed by computerized tomography, and total body fat (fat mass) was assessed by underwater weighing in 86 families participating in the Heritage Family Study. All family members were sedentary at baseline examination. The familial factors underlying the variability in age-adjusted AVF, age-fat mass-adjusted AVF and age-adjusted fat mass, were assessed using a familial correlation model. RESULTS: The maximal heritability (including genetic and familial environmental effects) for AVF was comparable before (47%) and after (48%) adjusting for fat mass, and was 55% for fat mass itself in these sedentary families. Spouse correlations were significant for fat mass and for AVF prior to, but not after, adjustment for fat mass. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the only previous study which investigated the familial aggregation of AVF (both in pattern and magnitude), suggesting that the factors underlying AVF in these sedentary families may be similar to those in the population at large. Although both genetic and familial environmental factors probably influence each of fat mass and AVF, there appears to be a predominantly genetic etiology for the visceral component which is independent of total body fat. These findings imply that some individuals are more at risk then others because of an inherited tendency to store abdominal fat viscerally rather than subcutaneously.

TI  - Factors protecting against the development of adjustment difficulties in young adults exposed to childhood sexual abuse.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to identify the factors which discriminated young people exposed to childhood sexual abuse (CSA) who developed psychiatric disorder or adjustment difficulties in young adulthood from those young people exposed to CSA who did not develop psychiatric disorder or adjustment difficulties by age 18. METHOD: Data were gathered on a birth cohort of 1,025 New Zealand children studied from birth to the age of 18 on (a) exposure to CSA; (b) patterns of psychiatric disorder and adjustment difficulties at age 18 years; (c) factors that may have influenced responses to CSA including characteristics of the abuse, parental bonding, parental characteristics, and adolescent peer affiliations. RESULTS: Just over 10% of the cohort reported CSA. Those reporting CSA were at increased risks of a range of difficulties at age 18 (depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, other substance abuse/dependence, post sexual abuse trauma, attempted suicide). However, not all of those exposed to CSA developed difficulties and approximately a quarter of those exposed to CSA did not meet criteria for any adjustment difficulty. Further analysis suggested that the extent of adjustment difficulties in those exposed to CSA was influenced by two additional factors: (a) the extent of affiliations with delinquent or substance using peers in adolescence; and (b) the extent of paternal care or support in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that while young people exposed to CSA are at increased risks of psychiatric disorder and adjustment difficulties in young adulthood, not all individuals exposed to CSA will develop adjustment difficulties. Important factors protecting against the development of adjustment difficulties in young people experiencing CSA appear to be the nature and quality of peer and family relationships.

TI  - Ethnic differences and factors related to breast cancer survival in Hawaii.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described differences in breast cancer survival among women from various ethnic backgrounds even after adjustment for stage at diagnosis. The aim of this study is to identify factors that could explain this disparity in prognosis and to update breast cancer survival patterns in Hawaii. METHODS: The Hawaii Tumor Registry identified 3345 breast cancer cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1988. The following covariates were studied: ethnicity, stage at diagnosis, geographical residence, and menopausal, marital and socioeconomic statuses. The Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards regression were used to estimate survival by group. RESULTS: Native Hawaiian and Filipino women had a higher risk of dying within 5 years than women of other ethnic groups. Japanese had the highest survival probability, followed by Chinese and Caucasians. Stage was the most important prognostic factor. Married women had better survival than widowed and divorced women. Filipinos had a much greater chance of dying from localized cancer than other women with localized disease. Geographical residence, menopausal and socioeconomic statuses were not associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an overall improvement in breast cancer survival, ethnic disparity in prognosis still exists. Other possible explanations for the differential prognosis, such as treatment, diet, genetics, obesity, oestrogen receptor and hormonal statuses need to be explored in future studies.

TI  - A longitudinal study of hospitalization rates for patients with chronic disease: results from the Medical Outcomes Study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively compare inpatient and outpatient utilization rates between prepaid (PPD) and fee-for-service (FFS) insurance coverage for patients with chronic disease. DATA SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: Data from the Medical Outcomes Study, a longitudinal observational study of chronic disease patients conducted in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. STUDY DESIGN: A four-year prospective study of resource utilization among 1,681 patients under treatment for hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure in the practices of 367 clinicians. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Insurance payment system (PPD or FFS), hospitalizations, and office visits were obtained from patient reports. Disease and severity indicators, sociodemographics, and self-reported functional status were used to adjust for patient mix and to compute expected utilization rates. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to FFS, PPD patients had 31 percent fewer observed hospitalizations before adjustment for patient differences (p = .005) and 15 percent fewer hospitalizations than expected after adjustment (p = .078). The observed rate of FFS hospitalizations exceeded the expected rate by 9 percent. These results are not explained by system differences in patient mix or trends in hospital use over four years. Half of the PPD/FFS difference in hospitalization rate is due to intrinsic characteristics of the payment system itself. CONCLUSIONS: PPD patients with chronic medical conditions followed prospectively over four years, after extensive patient-mix adjustment, had 15 percent fewer hospitalizations than their FFS counterparts owing to differences intrinsic to the insurance reimbursement system.

TI  - Smoking is associated with higher cardiovascular risk in young women than in men: the Tecumseh Blood Pressure Study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is associated with a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis and respiratory disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences between hemodynamic and biochemical findings in smokers and nonsmokers in the two sexes separately in the Tecumseh population. METHODS: We studied 851 subjects. They were divided according to smoking habits into group 1, nonsmokers (258 men and 234 women); and group 2, smokers (185 men and 174 women). RESULTS: Unpaired Student's t-tests and nonparametric tests were performed to determine the between-group P-values. Only hematocrit differed significantly between smokers and nonsmokers in both sexes (43.9 +/- 0.2 and 44.6 +/- 9.3%, P < 0.05 in men; 39.2 +/- 0.3 and 40.3 +/- 0.3%, P = 0.007 in women, respectively in nonsmokers and smokers). Triglycerides (80.6 +/- 3.8 and 99.6 +/- 4.3 mg/dl, P < 0.001), left ventricular mass index (95.4 +/- 1.9 and 100.0 +/- 1.2 g/m2, P = 0.008), and posterior wall thickness (9.5 +/- 0.1 and 9.71 +/- 0.01 mm, P = 0.044) were elevated and high-density lipoproteins were decreased (48.7 +/- 0.8 and 44.5 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, P < 0.01) only in women smokers.  After adjustment for home systolic blood pressure and body mass index the differences in women remained significant except for posterior wall thickness. CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoking is deleterious to both sexes but it appears to be particularly harmful to women. Our data can, in part, explain why the relative risk of myocardial infarction is higher in women than it is in men.

TI  - [Adaptation of the central nervous system to optical correction]  
AB  - Wearing spectacles imply an adjustment of the visual perception and eye movements. The visual cortex accounts for this plasticity, including at the adulthood, especially by the shift or the sprading of the receptor fields and the adjustment of the sensitivity of the primary visual cortex cells to spatial orientation and movement. The cerebellum modulates the vestibulo-ocular reflex gain. The adjustment latencies range from a few minutes to several days according to the disturbancy severity, the drug interferences and the age and medical history of the subject. Neurotrophins seem to be essential for this adjustment and might become an efficient tool to extend the plasticity period.

TI  - Determinants of the treatment climate in psychiatric and substance abuse programs: implications for improving patient outcomes.  
AB  - This study examined determinants of the treatment climate in 89 psychiatric and substance abuse programs. Clearer policies giving patients more control, and more health and treatment services, were related to more supportive, autonomous, expressive, and practically oriented milieus. In contrast, more policy choice and daily living assistance were associated with less support, personal expression, and practical orientation. Programs in which staff had more paraprofessionals and better team functioning, and in which patients had more social resources and better mental functioning, tended to be more supportive and to have more emphasis on autonomy, personal expression, and practical orientation. Based on these results, we suggest some guidelines on how to change the treatment milieu to benefit patients' adjustment.

TI  - Collaboration between pharmacy and laboratory: defining total allowable error limits for therapeutically monitored drugs.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the total allowable variability that is clinically tolerated for certain drug assays performed by the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) laboratory at our institution. METHODS: The monthly coefficient of variation (CV) for 13 of the most commonly performed drug assays was recorded for two concentrations: the upper and lower limits of the therapeutic range for each drug. A dosing simulation was performed for each drug by using population parameters to estimate the doses that would yield the two target concentrations in an adult patient.  The smallest practical dosage adjustment that could be implemented in clinical practice was determined and the serum concentration resulting from this dosage change was estimated. Each change was equated to two standard deviations from the original drug concentration, and the corresponding CV or total allowable error (TEa) was calculated and compared with the laboratory's CV value. RESULTS: The laboratory CV was greater than the clinically defined TEa for amikacin at both trough and peak ranges, and for gentamicin and tobramycin at the trough range. Simulations for a patient with compromised renal function produced TEa values less than the reported CV for amikacin at both trough and peak ranges. Simulations for an obese patient produced TEa values less than the reported CV for amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin at both trough and peak ranges. The assay variability for these aminoglycosides is greater than the expected change in serum drug concentrations produced by the dosage changes used in the simulations. The TEa for all other drugs exceeded the laboratory CV, demonstrating assay variability within the clinically tolerated range. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of how the variability of a drug assay compares with its TEa allows clinicians to assess the usefulness of a serum drug concentration as a clinical tool.

TI  - Adjustment for regression dilution in epidemiological regression analyses.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The term "regression dilution" describes the dilution/attenuation in a regression coefficient that occurs when a single measured value of a covariate is used instead of the usual or average value over a period of time. This paper reviews the current knowledge concerning a simple method of adjusting for regression dilution in single and multiple covariate situations and illustrates the adjustment procedure. METHODS: Formulation of the regression dilution problem as a measurement error problem allows existing measurement error theory to be applied to developing methods of adjustment for regression dilution. This theory leads to a precise method of adjustment for linear regression and approximate methods for logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression. The method involves obtaining the naive estimates of coefficients by assuming that covariates are not measured with error, and then adjusting these coefficients using reliability estimates for the covariates. Methods for estimating the reliability of covariates from the reliability and main study data and a method for the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals for adjusted coefficients are described. RESULTS: An illustration involving logistic regression analysis of risk factors for death from cardiovascular disease based on cohort and reliability data from the Busselton Health Study shows that the different methods for estimating the adjustment factors give very similar adjusted estimates of coefficients, that univariate adjustment procedures may lead to inappropriate adjustments in multiple covariate situations, whether or not other covariates have intra-individual variation, and when the reliability study is moderate to large, the precision of the estimates of reliability coefficients has little impact on the standard errors of adjusted regression coefficients. CONCLUSIONS: The simple method of adjusting regression coefficients for "regression dilution" that arises out of measurement error theory is applicable to many epidemiological settings and is easily implemented. The choice of method to estimate the reliability coefficient has little impact on the results. The practice of applying univariate adjustments in multiple covariate situations is not recommended.

AB  - So far, only few studies exist that have investigated the influence of occupational exposure to paint and lacquer on the risk of cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract. Based on data from the Heidelberg case control study which enrolled 369 patients with carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract and 1476 randomized control subjects, the relative risk of head and neck cancer in patients exposed to paint, lacquer and varnish was analyzed. The relative risk (RR) of squamous cell cancer (after adjustment for possible alcohol and tobacco effects) was significantly increased for the larynx (RR = 2.3) and the oral cavity (RR = 3.6). However, this risk was not increased for the pharynx. Our findings and a critical analysis of the literature provide evidence that chronic exposure to paint, varnish and lacquer is a definite risk factor for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract. Further studies are required to confirm these findings, and to identify more precisely toxic substances encountered in the workplace.

TI  - Capacity for plasticity in the adult owl auditory system expanded by juvenile experience [see comments]  
AB  - In the process of creating a multimodal map of space, auditory-visual neurons in the optic tectum establish associations between particular values of auditory spatial cues and locations in the visual field. In the barn owl, tectal neurons reveal these associations in the match between their tuning for interaural time differences (ITDs) and the locations of their visual receptive fields (VRFs). In young owls ITD-VRF associations can be adjusted by experience over a wide range, but the range of adjustment normally becomes quite restricted in adults. This normal range of adjustment in adults was greatly expanded in owls that had previously learned abnormal ITD-VRF associations as juveniles. Thus, the act of learning abnormal associations early in life leaves an enduring trace in this pathway that enables unusual functional connections to be reestablished, as needed, in adulthood, even when the associations represented by these connections have not been used for an extended period of time.

AB  - The object of this study is to evaluate the effects of age, gender, age-by-gender interaction, Type II diabetes, body weight, race, smoking, and formulation on steady-state pharmacokinetics of troglitazone, Metabolite 1 (sulfate conjugate), and Metabolite 3 (quinone metabolite) following multiple-dose oral administration of troglitazone. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates [Cl/F (apparent oral clearance), AUC0-24 (area under plasma concentration-time curve), and ratio of AUC for troglitazone to Metabolite 1 and to Metabolite 3] obtained from 84 healthy volunteers and 171 patients with Type II diabetes in 8 studies were analyzed using a graphical method (for race and smoking) or a weighted ANCOVA model incorporating gender, health status (healthy vs Type II diabetes), and formulation as main effects; age, age-by-gender interaction, and body weight as continuous covariates. Ratio of AUC for troglitazone to metabolites was also examined by inspection of log-probit plots. Age, gender, age-by-gender, Type II diabetes, and formulation had negligible effects on troglitazone Cl/F, AUC0-24 (all analytes), and AUC ratio of troglitazone to metabolites. Race and smoking did not appear to influence steady-state pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its metabolites. Although body weight was a significant covariate for AUC0-24 and Cl/F, the explanatory power of the overall model was weak (R2 < 0.2). Log-probit plots did not reveal a polymorphic distribution in AUC ratio of troglitazone to Metabolite 1 or Metabolite 3. Based on pharmacokinetics, dose adjustment for troglitazone in relation to the demographic factors examined is not required due to their poor predictive ability on steady-state pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its metabolites.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A study was undertaken to analyze the independent relationship between race (black/white) and cigarette smoking among 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States, 1983-1993. METHODS: An 11-year analysis of cross-sectional national surveys was used in the study. Odds ratio for current smoking among black-surveyed subjects (vs. whites) was determined. RESULTS: The multiple logistic regression-derived odds ratio (OR) for current smoking for blacks aged 18 to 24 years, vs. whites, decreased from 0.69 (95% CI 0.53, 0.89) in 1983 to 0.26 (95% CI 0.17, 0.42) in 1993. The combined-years model predicted a decrease in OR for blacks from 0.82 in 1983 to 0.30 in 1993, adjusted for sex, age, education, poverty status, and geographic region. CONCLUSION: From 1983 to 1993, blacks aged 18 to 24 years became decreasingly at risk to be smokers, compared to whites, even after adjustment for confounding factors. Young blacks have been more resistant than young whites to begin smoking in recent years. Understanding reasons behind this widening black/white difference could lead to better prevention strategies.

TI  - Predictors of quality of life and adjustment after lung transplantation.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined predictors of quality of life and adjustment after lung transplantation. This study determined whether pretransplant psychological measures predicted physical health, quality of life, and overall adjustment posttransplant. Cross-sectional analyses also examined differences in adjustment and quality of life for lung transplant candidates and recipients. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen transplant candidates and 60 transplant recipients completed questionnaires measuring adjustment and quality of life. In addition, we examined archival data on 107 transplant candidates who had received pretransplant psychological assessments, and posttransplant physical health status data were collected on these patients. Of the 107 patients who provided a pretransplant psychological assessment, 32 completed the questionnaires measuring posttransplant adjustment and quality of life. SETTING: University medical center transplant service. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses indicated significantly better adjustment and quality of life posttransplant. Pretransplant psychological variables were not associated with measures of posttransplant physical health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that pretransplant anxiety and psychopathology predicted posttransplant adjustment (beta's ranging from 0.32 to 0.68) and greater pretransplant anxiety also predicted worse posttransplant quality of life (beta's ranging from 0.29 to 0.62). Subjective sleep disturbances were associated with poorer adjustment and quality of life (beta's ranging from 0.36 to 0.75), and were found to mediate the relationship between presurgical anxiety and posttransplant adjustment and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that psychological status pretransplant predicted adjustment and quality of life posttransplant. Moreover, increased anxiety levels pretransplant predicted subsequent subjective sleep disturbances, which were, in turn, associated with poorer adjustment and quality of life. The benefits of pretransplant stress management interventions are discussed.

TI  - Predictors of quality of life and adjustment after lung transplantation.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined predictors of quality of life and adjustment after lung transplantation. This study determined whether pretransplant psychological measures predicted physical health, quality of life, and overall adjustment posttransplant. Cross-sectional analyses also examined differences in adjustment and quality of life for lung transplant candidates and recipients. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen transplant candidates and 60 transplant recipients completed questionnaires measuring adjustment and quality of life. In addition, we examined archival data on 107 transplant candidates who had received pretransplant psychological assessments, and posttransplant physical health status data were collected on these patients. Of the 107 patients who provided a pretransplant psychological assessment, 32 completed the questionnaires measuring posttransplant adjustment and quality of life. SETTING: University medical center transplant service. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses indicated significantly better adjustment and quality of life posttransplant. Pretransplant psychological variables were not associated with measures of posttransplant physical health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that pretransplant anxiety and psychopathology predicted posttransplant adjustment (beta's ranging from 0.32 to 0.68) and greater pretransplant anxiety also predicted worse posttransplant quality of life (beta's ranging from 0.29 to 0.62). Subjective sleep disturbances were associated with poorer adjustment and quality of life (beta's ranging from 0.36 to 0.75), and were found to mediate the relationship between presurgical anxiety and posttransplant adjustment and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that psychological status pretransplant predicted adjustment and quality of life posttransplant. Moreover, increased anxiety levels pretransplant predicted subsequent subjective sleep disturbances, which were, in turn, associated with poorer adjustment and quality of life. The benefits of pretransplant stress management interventions are discussed.

TI  - Electronic portal imaging with on-line correction of setup error in thoracic irradiation: clinical evaluation.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze setup errors and the feasibility of their on-line correction using electronic portal imaging in the irradiation of lung tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients with lung cancer were irradiated through opposed anteroposterior fields. Localization images of anteroposterior fields were recorded with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). Using an in-house developed algorithm for on-line comparison of portal images setup errors were measured and a correction of table position was performed with a remote couch control prior to treatment. In addition, residual errors were measured on the EPID verification image. Global and individual mean and standard deviation of setup errors were calculated and compared. The feasibility of the procedure was assessed measuring intra- and interobserver variability, influence of organ movement, reproducibility of error measurement, the extra time fraction needed for measuring and adjusting and the fraction of dose needed for imaging. RESULTS: In two setups the procedure could not be finished normally due to problems inherent to the procedure. The reproducibility, intraobserver variability, and influence of organ movements were each described by a distribution with a mean value less than or equal to 1 mm and a standard deviation (SD) of less than 1.5 mm. The interobserver variability showed to be a little bit larger (mean: 0.3 mm, SD: 1.7 mm). The mean time to perform the irradiation of the anteroposterior field was 4 +/- 1 min. The mean time for the measurement and correction procedure approximated 2.5 min. The mean extra time fraction was 65 +/- 24% (1 SD) with more than half of this coming from the error measurement. The dose needed for generation of EPID images was 5.9 +/- 1.4% of total treatment dose. The mean and SD of setup errors were, respectively, 0.1 and 4.5 mm for longitudinal and -2.0 and 5.7 mm for transversal errors. Of 196 measured translational errors 120 (61%) exceeded the adjustment criteria. For individual patients systematic and random setup errors can be as high as, respectively, 15.8 and 7.5 mm. Mean residual error and SD were for longitudinal direction 0.08 and 1.2 mm and for transversal direction -0.9 and 1.0 mm (pooled data). For individuals, the mean residual errors were smaller than 1 mm, with a typical SD per patient of less than 2 mm. CONCLUSION: Setup errors in thoracic radiation therapy are clinically important. On-line correction can be performed accurately with an objective measurement tool, although this prolongs the irradiation procedure for one field with 65%.

TI  - [Tramadol infusion for pain therapy following bladder exstrophy surgery in pediatric wards]  
AB  - We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction. Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8 +/- 1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff). Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4. Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy. Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8% to 95.2%. Three patients (17.6%) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7%). Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur. The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.

TI  - Adaptational effects during human split-belt walking: influence of afferent input.  
AB  - The modification of the normal locomotor pattern of humans was investigated using a split-belt locomotion protocol (treadmill belt speeds of 4.5 km/h and 1.5 km/h for the right and left legs, respectively) and also by changing afferent input from the legs (30% reduction or increase in body weight by suspending subjects in a parachute harness or by wearing a lead-filled vest). After a control-speed training period (10 min) of symmetrical walking (3 km/h each leg) and a period (10 min) of split-belt walking, the adjustment back to the control speed resulted in a mean speed difference between the right leg and the left leg of 0.85 km/h. Adjustment of belt speed on either side was performed by the hands using a potentiometer. For comparison, also speed adjustment by the feet via feedback derived from changes in the treadmill drive current was studied. No significant difference was obtained when both modes of adjustment were compared. Body unloading or loading during the training period resulted in an improved adjustment of treadmill belt speed. This suggests that load receptor information plays a major role in the programming of a new walking pattern.

TI  - Leptin in relation to prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.  
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine whether leptin, a hormone implicated in both energy-balance and reproductive function, is involved in the etiology of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We compared the serum leptin levels of 43 cases of incident prostate cancer, 41 patients with BPH, and 48 healthy controls, all recruited in Athens, Greece. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used, with adjustment for age, height, body mass index, education, estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin and insulin like growth factor 1. Odds ratios per 4 ng/ml increment of leptin were 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.32,1.55)] for prostate cancer and 1.06 [95% CI (0.67,1.67)] for BPH. After adjustment for body mass index, serum leptin levels were not significantly correlated with levels of any of the other hormones under study. Leptin levels are unlikely to affect the risk of either prostate cancer or BPH substantially.

TI  - Insulin and related factors in premenopausal breast cancer risk.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are important mitogens in vitro and in vivo. It has been hypothesized that these factors may play an important role in the development of breast cancer. METHODS: A case-control study comparing plasma insulin levels in 99 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed node-negative invasive carcinoma of the breast and 99 age-matched controls with incident biopsied non-proliferative breast disease (NP) was conducted. Women with known diabetes were excluded. RESULTS: For the entire study group, mean age was 42.6 +/- 5.1 years and mean weight was 62.9 +/- 10.3 kg. After adjustment for age and weight, elevated insulin levels were significantly associated with breast cancer, Odds Ratio (OR) for women in the highest insulin quintile versus the lowest quintile = 2.83 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.22-6.58). There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls for IGF-I and IGFBP-1 levels. However, after adjustment for age, the association between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and breast cancer approached statistical significance; OR for highest quintile versus lowest quintile of IGFBP-3 being 2.05 (95% CI, 0.93-4.53). All results were independent of diet and other known risk factors for breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Circulating insulin levels and possibly IGFBP-3 levels are elevated in women with premenopausal breast cancer. This association may reflect an underlying syndrome of insulin resistance that is independent of obesity.

Although minimal support was found for the main and interactive effects of objective work stress, behavioral control, and informational control on adjustment, analyses involving the subjective measures of these variables revealed strong support for the proposal that work stress, behavioral control, and informational control would exert main effects on adjustment. There was also evidence that subjective levels of behavioral control buffered the negative effects of subjective work stress on positive mood, subjective task performance, and task satisfaction.

TI  - Consonant-vowel intensity ratios for maximizing consonant recognition by hearing-impaired listeners.  
AB  - The effect of adjusting the consonant-vowel (C-V) intensity ratio on consonant recognition in 18 subjects with sensorineural hearing impairment was investigated. C-V intensity ratios in a set of 48 vowel-consonant nonsense syllables were adjusted in steps of 3-6 dB depending on the subject's dynamic range of hearing. An increase in consonant intensity is referred to here as consonant enhancement (CE). The value of CE producing the highest consonant recognition score (CRmax) is defined as CEmax. Both CEmax and CRmax were determined for each subject for each of the 48 nonsense syllables. Consonant type was found to have a highly significant effect on CRmax, the gain in consonant recognition, and CEmax. The effect of vowel environment was also significant, but of much smaller magnitude. Audiogram configuration was found to have a small effect and was only significant for CRmax. The results of the study also showed that individualized adjustment of the C-V intensity ratio for each subject and consonant-vowel combination can produce substantial improvements in consonant recognition. These data can be used to estimate upper bounds of performance that, in principle, can be obtained by appropriate adjustment of the C-V intensity ratio.

TI  - [GSG (Structured Health Regulation)-conforming documentation of surgical interventions in a university clinic--3 years clinical experiences 1994-1996]  
AB  - The cost increase in the public health sector is steadily mounting and hence politicians are forced to redefine the economic conditions for regulations. As a new quality in the area of inpatient hospital care the new German law of structural health care (GSG), valid as of January 1, 1993 replaces the principle of covering full costs. The GSG law required in our hospital an adjustment of existing EDP structures with integrated automatic remuneration estimate and the installation of a medical structure of the organisation for complete and correct documentation. Weakpoints of the prescribed obligatory ICPM codes and inadequate legal regulations result in a lack of separation or wrong integration of the lump sum payment in individual cases (FP) and special compensation (SE). The summary analysis of the compensation system with a subsequent medical control system showed a primarily inaccurate classification by 12%. There is as yet no proof for the usefulness of a lump sum payment system resulting in a selection of risks.

TI  - Vision-specific function and quality of life after cataract extraction in south India.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess visual and overall patient function after intracapsular (ICCE) and extracapsular (ECCE) cataract extraction in rural South India. SETTING: Aravind Eye Hospital, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, South India, and the Dana Center for Preventive Ophthalmology, Wilmer Eye Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. METHODS: This study evaluated preoperative visual acuity and demographic information and postoperative visual acuity and functional status measures in 71 patients having ECCE with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) placement and 73 patients having ICCE with aphakic spectacle correction at Aravind-Tirunelveli Eye Hospital, Tamil Nadu, India. The principal outcomes assessed were visual acuity; quality-of-life score (possible range 0 to 100%); visual function measurement (possible range 0 to 100%). RESULTS: Patients in the ECCE group scored 10.17 (P = .0001) points higher than those in the ICCE group on the visual function scale after adjustment for differences in age, sex, level of education, marital status, residence, and type of employment. The ECCE group scored 7.69 points higher on visual function when adjusting for the differences in best corrected visual acuity, which was also better in the ECCE group. In the quality-of-life assessment, 77.1% in the ECCE group and 46.6% in the ICCE group scored 90% or better (OR 3.85; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in rural south India having ECCE with posterior chamber IOL implantation obtained better postoperative visual function, quality of life, and visual acuity than those receiving ICCE with aphakic spectacle correction. These differences, which were not significantly affected by adjustment for age, sex, education, marital status, type of residence, and occupation, indicate that ECCE is clearly superior to ICCE.

TI  - Somatic function, mental health and psychosocial functioning in 22 adolescents with bladder exstrophy and epispadias.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We report the long-term somatic outcome, mental health and psychosocial adjustment in adolescents with bladder exstrophy and epispadias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 adolescents 11 to 20 years old (median age 14.5), including 19 with bladder exstrophy and 3 with epispadias, were assessed for urogenital status, stoma, renal and bowel function, anorectal physiology, mental health and psychosocial functioning by physical examinations, semistructured interviews and standardized questionnaires. The parents of 21 patients were interviewed and completed questionnaires. Information was also obtained on control groups. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients 9 (41%) had no urinary diversion and were urinary incontinent, 6 (27%) had persistent fecal staining and anal canal pressures that were lower than the controls, 10 (59%) were dissatisfied with the penile appearance and 11 (50%) met the criteria for psychiatric diagnoses. The main predictors of mental health were parental warmth and patient genital appraisal in the 11 to 14-year age group, and parental warmth and urinary continence function in the 15 to 20-year age group. Psychosocial dysfunction was predicted by fecal incontinence in the younger group and worries about future sexual relationships in the older group. CONCLUSIONS: The present multimodal outcome study revealed that adolescents with bladder exstrophy and epispadias had significant physical and mental problems. Genital malformation, and urinary and fecal incontinence may have a negative impact on mental health and psychosocial functioning. Our findings emphasize the need to include psychosocial experts on health care teams to reveal the amount of distress caused by these anomalies and to offer psychosocial support.

TI  - Do differences in sexual behaviors account for the racial/ethnic differences in adolescents' self-reported history of a sexually transmitted disease? [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: African-American adolescents have the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) of any racial/ethnic group of adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which racial/ethnic differences in sexual behaviors account for African-American adolescents' higher rates of STDs. STUDY DESIGN: A secondary analysis of data collected as part of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey supplement to the 1992 National Health Interview Survey was conducted. The sample included 5,189 nationally representative civilian noninstitutionalized sexually experienced United States adolescents 14 to 21 years of age. RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a reported history of an STD for African-American adolescents was 3.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.57, 9.50). The STD risk for African-American youth increased with the adjustment for other sociodemographic factors (OR = 4.13; CI = 1.71, 9.99) and decreased with the adjustment for sexual behaviors (OR = 3.67; CI = 1.55,8.66). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in sexual behaviors do not fully account for African-American adolescents' increased risk for STDs. Interventions designed to reduce sexual risk taking among African-American adolescents may not ameliorate racial/ethnic differences in rates of STDs.

TI  - Couples' adjustment to breast cancer and benign breast disease: a longitudinal analysis.  
AB  - A comprehensive comparison of couples' adjustment to benign (n = 73 couples) and malignant breast disease (n = 58 couples) at the time of diagnosis and at two follow-up assessments at 60 days and 1 year is reported. Specific objectives were to: (a) compare the concurrent stress, resources, appraisal, and patterns of adjustment of couples in the benign and malignant groups; (b) compare the psychosocial responses of patients versus spouses; and (c) determine the amount of correspondence in levels of adjustment reported by patients and their husbands over time. Multiple instruments with reported reliability and validity were used to measure study variables: Smilkstein Stress Scale, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Family APGAR, Social Support Questionnaire, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale. Mixed design analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to assess differences between and among couples and examine changes in study variables over time. Significant differences were found in the resources, appraisal, and patterns of adjustment reported by couples in the benign and malignant groups. Couples facing breast cancer reported greater decreases in their marital and family functioning, more uncertain appraisals, and more adjustment problems associated with the illness. In addition, there was a high degree of correspondence between the levels of adjustment reported by women with breast cancer and their husbands over time. Couples who reported high distress or a high number of role problems at diagnosis were likely to remain highly distressed at 60 days and 1 year. Study findings underscore the importance of assisting couples, not just patients, to manage the adjustment difficulties associated with breast cancer.

AB  - To study adjustment to hearing impairment, clinical records from a five-center consortium (N = 1,008) were used to create a heterogeneous clinical database with results of audiometric tests, demographic and case history information, and responses to the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI; Demorest & Erdman, 1986, 1987). Normative findings have been described previously (Erdman & Demorest, 1998). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that audiometric variables were moderately correlated with communication performance, behavioral strategies, and personal adjustment. With hearing impairment controlled statistically, age and education effects were evident in many areas of adjustment; correlations between adjustment and gender were relatively weak; and marital status, employment status, and race/ethnicity were rarely significant correlates.

TI  - Profiling assisted reproductive technology: outcomes and quality of infertility management.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the content of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)/Society for Reproductive Technology (SART) Registry. DESIGN: English-language literature review. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART). INTERVENTION(S): Current ART treatments, including IVF, GIFT, zygote intrafollopian transfer (ZIFT), oocyte micromanipulation, and cryopreserved embryo transfers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Compliance with clinical practice guidelines, and casemix-adjusted rates of live delivery, clinical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, birth defects, implantation, fertilization, and retrieval. RESULT(S): Outcomes should be adjusted for variation in patient characteristics known to affect prognosis, including maternal age, the duration of infertility, the presumed cause(s) of infertility, the patient's prior history of treatment for infertility, and diethylstilbestrol exposure. Outcome rates should be reported using the patient as the denominator, as well as cycle, retrieval, and transfer. The statistical significance of observed differences in events rates should be indicated. Because widely accepted clinical practice guidelines related to performance of ART procedures are not available, compliance with practice guidelines cannot currently be assessed. CONCLUSION(S): Reports based on ASRM/SART Registry data can be enhanced by refined casemix adjustment, assessing outcome rates per patient, as well as per component of ART procedure, and by providing an indication of the statistical significance of observed differences in event rates. In addition, a critical appraisal of available evidence related to particular aspects of infertility management would help clarify the areas in which there is an evidentiary basis for formulation of practice guidelines, as well as topics requiring additional clinical research.

TI  - Behavioral adjustment and social functioning of long-term survivors of childhood leukemia: parent and teacher reports.  
AB  - Obtained parent and teacher reports of behavior and social competence for children who were survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At follow-up, children were 5-18 years of age, 48 months postdiagnosis, in first continuous remission, and off chemotherapy. Each child had been randomized to receive either 1,800 cGy whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) plus intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX), or IT MTX alone as central nervous system prophylaxis, and one of four chemotherapy regimens that varied in treatment intensity. Scores on standardized measures (CBCL-P/T and PIC) were generally similar to instrument norms. Parents, but not teachers, reported heightened child somatic concerns. There was no effect of WBRT or chemotherapy regimen on ratings of behavioral adjustment. Results indicate minimal psychosocial morbidity among long-term survivors of ALL and suggest that the stressful life events associated with cancer and its treatment do not cause significant behavioral or emotional difficulties.

TI  - Convective treatments with on-line production of replacement fluid: a clinical experience lasting 6 years.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of techniques with on-line (OL) production of replacement fluid by filtration of dialysis fluid raises concerns about exposure of dialysis patients to pyrogenic substances. This work was undertaken to evaluate safety and feasibility of OL preparation of replacement fluid for haemodiafiltration (HDF). METHODS: OL HDF was carried out with commercially available monitors without any adjustment in the operational organization of our Centre. Bicarbonate dialysis fluid was filtered twice before being reinjected into the patients. The effects of acute load of OL fluid were assessed by very sensitive in vitro and in vivo tests; the chronic effects were assessed by monitoring the patients for the appearance of any untoward clinical manifestations and by measuring their cytokine response. RESULTS: In a pilot study the membrane filter culture technique of replacement fluid yielded no bacteria or mycetes growth, while LAL test was < 0.01 EU/ml. The normal human monocyte production of TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra was not significantly different when cells were incubated with OL or commercial replacement fluid. The patients' body temperature profile (continuous recording during treatments and the following 24 h) overlapped with that of the control procedure. Over 6 years we performed 4284 OL treatments (total amount reinjected fluid 102,900 litres) on 13 patients treated for 26 +/- 9 months. In none of these treatments did we observe pyrogenic reactions. In comparison with the previous period on standard bicarbonate haemodialysis, OL HDF afforded significantly better cardiovascular tolerance to fluid removal and higher Kt/V values. The nutritional status did not deteriorate, while the acute-phase reactants and serum beta 2M levels did not increase. Moreover, no translucent cysts or destructive arthropathy were observed on bone X-rays. The patients' plasma cytokine levels and monocytes cytokines production, measured either before or after a single OL HDF, were comparable with the values obtained in controls treated with standard HDF. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that OL-prepared replacement fluid is as safe as that of the commercial bags with regard to sterility and non-pyrogenicity. OL HDF can be readily implemented in any dialysis centre without bringing any further burden on the staff.

TI  - The relationship of demographic factors, locus of control and self-efficacy to successful nursing home adjustment.  
AB  - This study investigated demographic and psychological predictors of 58 older adults' successful adjustment to a nursing home. Predictors included demographic variables, locus of control, and self-efficacy beliefs. Successful adjustment was defined by activity level and by positive and negative affect. Findings suggest that demographic variables were not effective predictors of successful adjustment. Perceived self-efficacy accounted for more of the unique variance in adjustment than locus of control. Results are discussed in the context of improving resident adjustment to nursing home environments.

TI  - Accommodation in mean f0 during mother-infant and father-infant vocal interactions: a longitudinal case study.  
AB  - Reports that infants imitate the vocal pitch characteristics of adult caregivers (e.g. Lewis, 1936/1951) include Lieberman's (1967; Lieberman, Ryalls & Rabson, 1982) claim that infants differentially adjust their vocal pitch or fundamental frequency (f0) towards that of their caregivers, resulting in higher mean pitch when interacting with mothers than when interacting with fathers. However, a recent cross-sectional study of infants at ages 0:8 to 0:9 and 1:0 failed to find evidence of differential pitch adjustment toward male and female caregivers (Siegel, Cooper, Morgan & Brennessie-Sarshad, 1990). A more sensitive test of Lieberman's claims would be to use a longitudinal design, with spontaneous recording sessions repeated over many months. The current study presents data from a longitudinal case study of an infant recorded at ages 0:3, 0:7, 0:10, 1:3 and 1:5 interacting with each of her parents in spontaneous play sessions and in isolated play. The infant in our study did not demonstrate significant adjustment of her vocal pitch in the direction of either parent. However, we did find evidence for consistent adjustment by the parents, in accord with the literature on infant-directed speech and mother-infant dyadic interactions, which suggest that the parents adjusted their behavior to suit the infant more than vice versa.

TI  - Serotonin and heart rate in hypertensive and normotensive subjects.  
AB  - Plasma and platelet levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) may be altered in essential hypertension. To establish the determinants and correlates of 5 HT in plasma and platelets, we studied 53 untreated subjects with essential hypertension (26 men; 30 whites; mean supine blood pressure 172/101 mm Hg; mean age 49.3 +/- 1.5 years) and 61 normotensive subjects (37 men; 47 whites; mean supine blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg; mean age 42.8 +/- 1.6 years). Plasma and platelet 5 HT were assayed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. No significant difference was found in platelet-poor plasma or platelet 5 HT levels in hypertensive or normotensive subjects (plasma: 43.0 +/- 4.2 and 39.6 +/- 4.4 nmol/L; platelet: 1.65 +/- 1.22 and 1.70 +/- 1.39 nmol/10(9) cells in hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively). No significant correlation was found between plasma or platelet 5 HT and systolic or diastolic blood pressure (plasma: r = 0.01 and 0.01 in normotensive subjects and r = 0.01 and -0.14 in hypertensive subjects; platelet: r = 0.12 and 0.13 in normotensive subjects and r = 0.02 and -0.09 in hypertensive subjects). However, plasma 5 HT was associated with supine and standing pulse rates (supine: r = 0.27, p = 0.05 in normotensive subjects and r = 0.54, p < 0.001 in hypertensive subjects; standing: r = 0.19 and r = 0.46, p < 0.001, respectively). Significant relations were also found between platelet 5 HT levels and supine and standing heart rate in the subjects mentioned above (supine: r = 0.28, p = 0.05 in normotensive subjects and r = 0.64, p < 0.001 in hypertensive subjects; standing: r = 0.24 and r = 0.51, p < 0.001, respectively). These associations were stronger in the hypertensive group as a whole, and they held when adjustment was made for differences in age and total blood cholesterol. The present study showed that plasma and platelet 5 HT are not significantly altered in hypertensive subjects. However, plasma and platelet 5 HT levels showed a significant association with supine and standing pulse rate predominantly in hypertensive subjects. This is consistent with experimental evidence of a positive chronotropic effect of 5 HT on perfused hearts and it suggests a possible role of plasma serotonin in the regulation of heart rate.

TI  - A flexible algorithm for construction of 3-D vessel networks for use in thermal modeling.  
AB  - A new algorithm for the construction of artificial blood vessel networks is presented. The algorithm produces three-dimensional (3-D) geometrical representations of both arterial and venous networks. The key ingredient of the algorithm is a 3-D potential function defined in the tissue volume. This potential function controls the paths by which points are connected to existing vessels, thereby producing new vessel segments. The potential function has no physiological interpretation, but, by adjustment of parameters governing the potential, it is possible to produce networks that have physiologically meaningful geometrical properties. If desired, the veins can be generated counter current to the arteries. Furthermore, the potential function allows fashioning of the networks to the presence of bone or air cavities. The resulting networks can be used for thermal simulations of hyperthermia treatment.

TI  - Low weight/length ratio to assess risk of cerebral palsy and perinatal mortality in twins.  
AB  - The etiology of increased rates of cerebral palsy (CP) in twins is unclear, but likely is associated with growth retardation, which occurs more often in twins. Asymmetric growth restriction, a form of growth retardation, has been found associated with increased rates of perinatal morbidity in infants with normal centile birthweights, and occurs more often in twins. Data from 55,457 infants were evaluated. Associations between twinning, CP, and neonatal mortality were evaluated. Influences of confounding factors, such as prematurity, perinatal depression, and asymmetric growth were assessed. Although twinning was a significant univariate correlate of both CP and neonatal mortality, low weight/length ratio (a marker of asymmetric growth) was a better correlate of both outcomes, and twinning was not significantly associated with either outcome after logistic adjustment for factors such as prematurity, perinatal depression, and low weight/length ratio. Low weight/length ratio occurred more often in twins of advancing gestational age, supporting a hypothesis of competition for nutritional resources as the cause for increased rates of low weight/length ratio in twins as compared with singletons. Asymmetric growth restriction is an important correlate of neonatal morbidity in twins, and should be considered when these factors are assessed in infants from multiple gestations.

TI  - Influence of diabetes during pregnancy on gestational age-specific newborn weight among US black and US white infants.  
AB  - This study examined the impact of maternal diabetes on birth weight for gestational age patterns of all term black infants and white infants in the United States using data derived from the 1990-1991 US Live Birth File of the National Center for Health Statistics. Infants of both black mothers and white mothers exhibited the expected fetal overgrowth associated with maternal diabetes. However, the increase in birth weight was much greater in infants of black than white diabetic mothers in comparison with their nondiabetic counterparts, as measured by the discrepancy in birth weight between infants of diabetic and nondiabetic mothers at each gestational week, the incidence of large for gestational age, high birth weight, small for gestational age, and low birth weight.  After adjustment for maternal hypertension, prenatal care use, and sociodemographic factors, the disparity in mean birth weight associated with diabetes was 211.67 g in black infants and 115.74 g in white infants. The adjusted odds ratios of birth weight > or = 4,000 g were 2.98 (95% confidence interval 2.89-3.12) for black infants and 1.83 (95% confidence interval 1.78-1.89) for white infants. Given the potential risks for mothers and infants consequent to maternal diabetes and fetal hyperinsulinemia, further investigation of the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of diabetes during pregnancy among black mothers and infants is warranted.

TI  - Father's effect on infant birth weight.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether paternal size at birth and during young adulthood influences the birth weight of the offspring. STUDY DESIGN: This historic cohort study followed up girls born in Copenhagen during 1959 to 1961. Their pregnancies in 1974 to 1989 were traced through the Danish Population Register, and the Personal Identification Numbers of the fathers of the children were obtained. Paternal birth weight was obtained from midwifery records and adult stature from military draft records. RESULTS: Compared with fathers who weighed at least 4 kg at birth, fathers who weighed 3 to 3.99 kg at birth had infants who were 109 gm lighter, and fathers who weighed <3 kg had infants who were 176 gm lighter after adjustment for maternal birth weight and adult stature, smoking, and medical and socioeconomic factors.  After adjustment, fathers in the lowest quartile of adult body mass index had infants that were 105 gm lighter than those of fathers in the highest quartile. Both paternal birth weight and adult body mass index exhibited significant trends in association with infant birth weight. CONCLUSION: Independently of maternal size, the father's physical stature, particularly his own size at birth, influences the birth weight of his children.

TI  - Respiratory disease in workers exposed to colophony solder flux fumes: continuing health concerns.  
AB  - The objectives of this study were to establish the prevalence of respiratory, eye, nose and throat symptoms of likely work-relation in workers exposed to colophony solder flux fumes and to assess their lung function. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four medium-sized electronics firms in which control measures to capture solder flux fume were absent or visibly ineffective. All female solders and women working adjacent to soldering stations completed an administered questionnaire concerning symptoms, work history and current soldering frequency. Measurements were made of their forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) during the course of a working shift, using a Vitallograph-Compact portable spirometer. Using weekly hours of soldering as a crude index of current exposure, workers were classified into high (> or = 37 h/wk) and low (< or = 20 h/wk) exposure groups, and their health responses were compared in the analysis. Individuals with symptoms suggestive of work-related asthma were also asked to provide serial peak flow measurements over a further 2-week period, and adequate returns were charted and read by two physicians experienced in the diagnosis of occupational asthma. Data were collected on 152 female workers (overall participation rate = 97%). Symptoms of recurrent, persistent wheeze and/or chest tightness were reported by 75 (49%) of interviewees; 36 (24%) gave a history typical of occupational asthma and six more (4%) a history of pre-existing asthma worsened at work. Twenty-one (14%) of the workforce complained of recurrent breathlessness on moderate exertion; 41 workers (27%) had work-related symptoms of the nose or throat and 25 (16%) had work-related eye symptoms. The odds ratios for 'all wheeze', shortness of breath, and work-related eye, nose and chest symptoms were all significantly greater (raised about 4-5 fold) in women who soldered > or = 37 h/wk when compared with those soldering < or = 20 h/wk.  After adjustment by logistic regression for atopy, age and smoking status even higher risk estimates were generally obtained. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for high vs. low were: for 'all wheeze', OR = 7.2, CI = 2.5-20.7; for work-related eye symptoms, OR = 5.2, CI = 1.4-19.8; for work-related nasal symptoms, OR = 4.0, CI = 1.4-11.1 and for occupational asthma symptoms, OR = 5.2, CI = 1.4-14.2. Mean FEV1 and FVC percentage difference from expected were slightly lower in full-time solderers than in part-time solderers, but the differences were not significant. Thirty-seven of the 51 workers (73%) who were asked to carry out serial peak flow measurements completed an adequate return: 27 of these records confirmed the presence of asthma, and in all of the cases the history suggested onset post-dating employment in soldering. Eleven peak flow records were indicative of occupational asthma. The health problems associated with colophony solder flux were documented over 18 years ago, but are still clearly apparent in situations where adequate control has not been achieved.

TI  - Beyond good and bad coping: a multidimensional examination of coping with pain in persons with rheumatoid arthritis.  
AB  - This article examines the utility of using a multidimensional instrument to assess pain coping in two samples of persons with rheumatoid arthritis (total N = 378). The predictive validity of the newly developed Vanderbilt Multidimensional Pain Coping Inventory (VMPCI), which assesses eleven distinct coping strategies, was compared to that of the previously validated Vanderbilt Pain Management Inventory (VPMI), which assesses the two broad dimensions of active and passive coping. In both samples, the VMPCI demonstrated reliable incremental validity over the VPMI in predicting both positive and negative psychological adjustment, and the predictive ability of the VPMI was highly redundant with that of the VMPCI. Moreover, using the VMPCI, both positive and negative adjustment were related to multiple coping strategies in ways that could not be revealed by the VPMI. These results offer considerable validation to the VMPCI and illustrate the value of assessing coping multidimensionally.

TI  -  Psychosocial adjustment among Central American immigrants with disabilities: an exploratory study.  
AB  - This is an exploratory study that investigated factors influencing the psychosocial adjustment of Central American immigrants with disabilities. The relationships between stress, and perception of disability severity and (a) depression and (b) anxiety were assessed. Furthermore, this study investigated whether social support moderated the impact of stress and severity of disability on depression and anxiety. Stress, severity of disability, and social support explained a high percentage (54%) of the variance in depression. High levels of stress, increased perceptions of severity of disability, and low social support were associated with increased depression. The interactions between support and stress and between support and disability severity did not significantly add to the original model which predicted depression. Main effects were found for stress, disability severity, and the interaction between support and disability severity. Stress and social support significantly accounted for 31% of the variance in anxiety. Increased stress and decreased social support were associated with greater levels of anxiety. The interaction between support and stress did not significantly predict anxiety. Implications of the study in terms of future research and intervention programs targeting mental health outcomes for Latino immigrants with disabilities are discussed.

TI  - Influence of dietary lysine on the utilization of zinc from zinc sulfate and a zinc-lysine complex by young pigs.  
AB  - We conducted two trials (n = 144 and 96) to evaluate the response of feeding either ZnSO4 x H2O or a zinc-lysine complex (ZnLys) in combination with various lysine levels on growth performance, liver, kidney, and 10th rib Zn concentration, serum Zn humoral immune response and absorption of Zn (chromic oxide method) of young pigs. The following treatments were started after a 7-d postweaning adjustment during which all pigs were fed a common diet adequate in zinc. Diets were as follows: 1) basal 1 (B1), .8% dietary lysine without added Zn (basal contained 32 ppm Zn); 2) B1 plus 100 ppm Zn from ZnSO4; 3) B1 plus 100 ppm Zn from ZnLys, 4) basal 2 (B2), 1.1% lysine without added Zn; 5) B2 plus 100 ppm Zn from ZnSO4; 6) B2 plus 100 ppm Zn from ZnLys. In Trial 1 only, 100 ppm Zn from ZnSO4 (diet 7) or ZnLys (diet 8) was added to a .95% lysine basal diet. The basal 20% CP diet contained 9.0% corn gluten meal to lower the total lysine level. Within lysine level, all diets were made isolysinic by using crystalline lysine. Zinc sulfate, ZnLys, or lysine replaced dextrose in the basal diet. After 4 wk on test, one barrow in each pen was killed; liver, kidney, left 10th rib, and contents of the stomach, small intestine, and lower colon were removed for Zn analyses. Performance (ADG and ADFI) was only improved (P < .05) in one of the two trials when either zinc source was added to the basal diets, but performance was higher (P < .01) for pigs fed 1.1% lysine diets compared with .8% lysine diets in both trials. Serum Zn concentrations were lower (P < .001) for pigs fed both dietary lysine basal diets without added Zn. The humoral response to sheep red blood cells and ovalbumin was not influenced (P > .20) by lysine level, or Zn level and source. Pigs fed diets without added Zn had lower (P < .001) liver, kidney, and rib Zn concentrations than pigs fed diets with added Zn regardless of Zn source. Dietary lysine did not influence liver Zn, but kidney (P < .01) and rib (P < .001) Zn concentrations were lower for pigs fed the higher lysine level. Digestibility coefficients of Zn were lower in the stomach for pigs fed diets without added Zn, similar among Zn levels and sources in the small intestine, and higher in the lower colon for pigs fed the basal diets without added Zn. Lysine level and Zn source did not influence Zn absorption. The ZnSO4 and a zinc lysine complex seemed to be equally effective in promoting growth performance, zinc absorption, and tissue stores of young pigs when diets contained deficient, adequate, or slightly more than adequate levels of lysine.

TI  - Occlusal adjustment and the incidence of demand for temporomandibular disorder treatment.  
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Contrary to clinical opinion, the structural risk from dental occlusion in temporomandibular disorders has been questioned or considered to be insignificant in clinical practice. PURPOSE: This study tested the effect of elimination of occlusal interference through occlusal adjustment, on the incidence of temporomandibular disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a controlled clinical trial of 146 healthy children and adolescents, half of the subjects underwent occlusal adjustment aimed at elimination of the presumed structural risk, and the other half underwent mock adjustment. Adjustments were repeated every 6 months over a period of 4 years. The outcome variable was the incidence of temporomandibular disorders, operatively defined as request for treatment of symptoms characteristic of the disorders with presence of clinical signs demonstrated in the muscles of mastication and/or jaw joint. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate was 9/67 in the mock adjustment group and 1/60 in the real adjustment group, for a relative risk of 8.06. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p = 0.019). Conclusions: Elimination of the presumed structural risk from the dental occlusion appeared to significantly reduce the incidence of temporomandibular disorders in a select group of young subjects.

TI  - Practice styles of US compared to UK neurologists.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed variation between neurologists in the United States and United Kingdom in their diagnostic and treatment decisions for commonly encountered neurologic presentations, and identified explanatory factors for any observed variation. METHODS: All 210 consultant neurologists in the United Kingdom and a nationally representative sample of 595 US neurologists received mailed surveys containing three detailed clinical scenarios depicting patients with (1) a single unprovoked seizure occurring 3 days previously, (2) early Parkinson's disease, and (3) dementia. The main study outcome measures were self-reported decisions regarding diagnostic test ordering and treatment, which were assessed after each scenario. Neurologists' practice characteristics, certainty about the diagnosis, and attitudes toward uncertainty were also measured. Survey response rates were 92% of US and 63% of UK neurologists. RESULTS: A higher proportion of US than UK neurologists indicated they would order additional diagnostic tests for all three scenarios (all p < 0.05); 77% of UK compared with 26% of US neurologists would manage a single unprovoked seizure without antiepileptic medication (p < 0.0001), but treatment of early Parkinson's disease was not different. Nearly all US and UK neurologists would obtain a neuroimaging study in the evaluation of dementia. International differences persisted after adjustment for differences in demographic and practice characteristics and for attitudes toward test use and clinical uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: We identified large international variation in clinical decisions across three common neurologic conditions. Cross-country collaboration should explore these differences to develop consensus on standards of care.

TI  - Predictors of patients' mental adjustment to cancer: patient characteristics and social support.  
AB  - Because being diagnosed with cancer is considered to be extremely stressful, cancer patients' mental adjustment has been widely studied. Previous studies have revealed that cancer patients' mental adjustment is correlated with the quality of life and the degree of psychological distress and have suggested that one of the most adaptive adjustments is 'fighting spirit' whereas one of the most maladaptive is 'helplessness/hopelessness'. However, little is known about the association between patients' mental adjustment to cancer and their spouses characteristics or social support network. This paper describes a study of cancer patients' characteristics and social support factors as predictors of the patients' responses to having cancer. A total of 455 ambulatory cancer patients completed the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale and participated in a structured interview about their characteristics and social support. The results of multiple regression analysis suggested that size of household, performance status, support from physicians and satisfaction with support were predictive of patients' fighting spirit, whereas age, education, size of household, performance status and satisfaction with support were predictive of helplessness/hopelessness.

TI  - Comparison of psychosocial adaptation of advanced stage Hodgkin's disease and acute leukemia survivors. Cancer and Leukemia Group B.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term psychosocial adaptation of Hodgkin's disease and adult acute leukemia survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-three Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 206 adult acute leukemia (AL) survivors were interviewed by telephone concerning their psychosocial adjustment and problems they attributed to having been treated for cancer, using identical research procedures and a common set of instruments. The following measures were used: Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS); Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI); current Conditioned Nausea and Vomiting triggered by treatment-related stimuli (CNVI); Indices of Employment, Insurance and Sexual Problems Attributed to Cancer; Negative Socioeconomic Impact of Cancer Index (NSI). All participants had been treated on one of nine Hodgkin's disease or 13 acute leukemia Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) clinical trials from 1966-1988, and had been off treatment for one year or more (mean years: HD = 5.9; AL = 5.6). RESULTS: HD survivors' risk of having a high distress score on the BSI was almost twice that found for AL survivors (odds ratio = 1.90), with 21% of HD vs. 14% of AL survivors (P < 0.05) having scores that were 1.5 standard deviations above the norm, suggestive of a possible psychiatric disorder. HD survivors reported greater fatigue (POMS Fatigue, P = 0.01; Vigor Subscales, P = 0.001), greater conditioned nausea (CNVI, P < 0.05), greater impact of cancer on their family life (PAIS Domestic Environment, P = 0.004) and poorer sexual functioning (PAIS Sexual Relationships, P = 0.0001), than AL survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-related issues may have placed HD survivors at a greater risk for problems in long-term adaptation than AL survivors.

We performed a retrospective cohort study in 99 female retired dancers (mean age 51 years, SD 14 years) and 99 normal controls, derived from a twin study, matched hierarchically for age, height, weight and menopausal status. Starting age of ballet was recalled and weekly hours of ballet as a child was self-reported on two occasions. BMD was measured using dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry and reported as a Z-score. Self-reported hours of ballet class undertaken per week at each age between 10 and 12 years was positively associated with a difference in BMD between dancers and controls at both the femoral neck site (beta = 0.73, p = 0.001) and the total hip site (beta = 0.55, p < 0.01). These associations were unaffected by adjustment for covariates including measures of adult activity (current physical activity, years of fulltime ballet), measures of menstrual disturbance (age of menarche, history of irregular menses), dietary history (calcium intake as a child, adolescent or adult) or lifestyle factors (lifetime smoking, lifetime alcohol). Although starting age of ballet was negatively associated with weight-adjusted within-pair hip BMD difference, it was no longer associated after adjustment for weekly hours of ballet. There was no relationship between hours of ballet undertaken as a child and differences in BMD at the lumbar spine or upper limb, at any age. Our data suggest that classical ballet classes undertaken between the ages of 10 and 12 years are independently and positively associated with a difference in hip BMD between dancers and controls. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that this age range identifies a stage of development when the proximal femur is particularly responsive to weightbearing exercise.

TI  - Health and health expenditures in adjusting and non-adjusting countries.  
AB  - The focus of this study is on the impact of World Bank structural adjustment operations on health expenditures and outcomes. We compare trends and levels of real per capita public spending on health, private consumption (which is the resource base for private health expenditures), and groupings child mortality indicators in four groups of countries. These are: (i) countries that started to borrow for the adjustment process early--Early Adjustment Lending (EAL) countries, (ii) Other Adjustment Lending (OAL) countries, (iii) Non-Adjustment Lending countries whose economies grew during the period 1985-1990 (NAL+), and (iv) Non-Adjustment Lending countries whose economies did not grow (NAL-). The NAL- group provides a 'counterfactual' for comparison with the two groups of adjusting countries. The results show that the fear about possible declines in health care spending in adjusting countries is unwarranted for EAL countries, that is those countries that started the adjustment process early and took it seriously. Government spending on health care increased on average for this group of countries, as did private consumption levels. Government health care expenditures also continued to increase in OAL countries, but mixed GDP growth performance has left little room for increased private spending. However, those countries that showed negative growth in the late eighties and did not start an adjustment process, fared worse throughout: real per capita public health care spending declined during the late eighties and increased less than in the other countries during 1989-1993, while private consumption has declined steadily. The trends in child mortality indicators show tremendous and continuing progress during the past two or three decades with few discernible differences among the four country groupings.

TI  - Factor V Leiden is not a risk factor for arterial vascular disease in the elderly: results from the Cardiovascular Health Study.  
AB  - Coagulation factor V Leiden is a risk marker for venous thrombosis. For arterial thrombosis no large study to date has included population-based elderly patients. The Cardiovascular Health Study is a longitudinal study of 5,201 men and women over age 65. With 3.4-year follow-up, we studied 373 incident cases of myocardial infarction (MI), angina, stroke. or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and 482 controls. The odds ratios for each event with heterozygous factor V Leiden were: MI, 0.46 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.25); angina, 1.0 (95% CI 0.45 to 2.23); stroke, 0.77 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.70): TIA, 1.33 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.55); any outcome, 0.83 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.44).  Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors did not change relationships. In older adults factor V Leiden is not a risk factor for future arterial thrombosis.

TI  - A comparison of the early outcome of acute myocardial infarction in women and men. The Third International Study of Infarct Survival Collaborative Group [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous studies, unadjusted comparisons of mortality and major morbidity after acute myocardial infarction have generally indicated that women have a poorer outcome than men. Much larger studies are needed, with more complete adjustment for coexisting conditions, to determine whether this difference is explained by the older age of the women studied or by the presence of other unfavorable prognostic factors, or both. METHODS: As part of the Third International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-3), information was collected on deaths during days 0 to 35 and on major clinical events during hospitalization up to day 35 for 9600 women and 26,480 men with suspected acute myocardial infarction who were considered to have a clear indication for fibrinolytic therapy. We compared the outcome among women and men, first without adjustment, then with adjustment for age, and finally with adjustment for other recorded baseline characteristics by means of multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The unadjusted odds ratio for death among women as compared with men was 1.73 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.61 to 1.86). The women were significantly older than the men, and after adjustment for age the odds ratio was reduced markedly to 1.20 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.29). Adjustment for other differences in base-line clinical features further reduced the odds ratio to 1.14 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.23). Excesses in other major clinical events among women were generally reduced to a similar extent by adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: It seems likely that there is at most only a small independent association between female sex and early mortality and morbidity after suspected acute myocardial infarction.

TI  - Coping with a partner's cancer: adjustment at four stages of the illness trajectory.  
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To study the psychosocial adjustment of partners/spouses of patients with cancer at four specific stages of the illness trajectory time of diagnosis, period of first remission, first recurrence, and period of metastatic disease. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey. SETTINGS: A university cancer center, a private cancer clinic, and a clinic in a large city serving people who are uninsured and unable to pay for their treatment. SAMPLE: 175 partners of patients who were in one of four specific stages of the illness trajectory participated in this study, Various types of cancer were represented. Seventy-seven participants were men, and 98 were women; their mean age was 49 years. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was used to collect data on psychosocial adjustment, specific sources of social support, dyadic adjustment, coping strategies, emotional response, cognitive response, and personal control. FINDINGS: Results indicate that partners of patients who were experiencing a recurrence of their illness or who were in the metastatic stage of the disease were more vulnerable to increased distress and problems of adjustment. Women also reported higher levels of distress than men. Variables that had the most significant direct affect on adjustment were emotional response, cognitive response, family support, and partner cohesion. Coping strategies influenced emotion and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Caring for partners is essential to promoting quality of life for the patient and the family. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Assessment, providing an opportunity to express concerns, and referral for psychosocial intervention as necessary are important to promote the highest possible quality of life for partners and patients.

TI  - Effect of different technical treatments of rapeseed on the feed value for broilers and laying hens.  
AB  - The effect of different technical treatments of rapeseed on its feed value for broilers and laying hens was the object of the study. The technical treatments comprised different grinding procedures (whole seed, roller mill--coarse and fine adjustment, flake mill) resulting in different average particle sizes of the ground seed and thermal treatments of flaked seed (hydrothermal treatment, micronizer, jet sploder). Each thermal treatment was carried out at two temperatures. A marked increase in the digestibility of organic matter and of the AMEN content was observed as the average particle size of the seed was decreased to < or = 0.56 mm and was much more pronounced for the broilers. AMEN contents of 21.1 to 22 and 22.6 to 23 MJ/kg DM were observed at this particle sizes for broilers and hens, respectively. Thermal treatment of rapeseed improved the apparent crude fat digestibility slightly whereas the apparent crude protein digestibility tended to decrease especially at the higher temperatures. This resulted in inconsistent changes in the apparent digestibility of the organic matter and the AMEN content. Only the treatment with hot air (jet sploder) seemed to have preferential effects on the feed value for both broilers and hens. For the thermal treatments AMEN contents ranged from 18.8 to 21.9 and 19.0 to 24.3 MJ/Kg DM for broilers and hens, respectively.

TI  - Psychosocial work characteristics and social support as predictors of SF-36 health functioning: the Whitehall II study [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether work characteristics and social support are predictors of physical, psychological, and social functioning. METHOD: Work characteristics (Karasek and Siegrist models) and social support at baseline were used to predict health functioning measured by the SF-36 General Health Survey 5 years later in a prospective cohort study of 10,308 British male and female civil servants. RESULTS: Effort-reward imbalance and negative aspects of close relationships predicted poor physical, psychological, and social functioning after adjustment for the potential confounding effects of age, employment grade, baseline ill health, and negative affectivity. These psychosocial characteristics seem to act in a similar way in the healthy and those with existing illness. Psychological demands at work in women, and low confiding/emotional support in men, also predicted poor functioning. Etiologically. these effects are not mediated through health-related behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Negative aspects of work (high demands and effort-reward imbalance) and negative aspects of close relationships are independent powerful predictors of poor health functioning. They may have an etiological role, which is independent of baseline illness.

TI  - Nonsurgical factors that influence the outcome of bariatric surgery: a review.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe obesity (ie, at least 100% overweight or body mass index > or =40 kg/m2) is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality. It is apparently becoming more common in this country. Conventional weight-loss treatments are usually ineffective for severe obesity and bariatric surgery is recommended as a treatment option. However, longitudinal data on the long-term outcome of bariatric surgery are sparse. Available data indicate that the outcome of bariatric surgery, although usually favorable in the short term, is variable and weight regain sometimes occurs at 2 years after surgery. The objective of this study is to present a review of the outcome of bariatric surgery in three areas: weight loss and improvement in health status, changes in eating behavior, and psychosocial adjustment. The study will also review how eating behavior, energy metabolism, and psychosocial functioning may affect the outcome of bariatric surgery. Suggestions for additional research in these areas are made. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: On average, most patients lose 60% of excess weight after gastric bypass and 40% after vertical banded gastroplasty. In about 30% of patients, weight regain occurs at 18 months to 2 years after surgery. Binge eating behavior, which is common among the morbidly obese, may recur after surgery and is associated with weight regain. Energy metabolism may affect the outcome of bariatric surgery, but it has not been systematically studied in this population. Presurgery psychosocial functioning does not seem to affect the outcome of surgery, and psychosocial outcome is generally encouraging over the short term, but there are reports of poor adjustment after weight loss, including alcohol abuse and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Factors leading to poor outcome of bariatric surgery, such as binge eating and lowered energy metabolism, should be studied to improve patient selection and outcome. Long-term outcome data on psychosocial functioning are lacking. Longitudinal studies to examine the long-term outcome of bariatric surgery and the prognostic indicators are needed.

TI  - A physiologically based pharmacokinetic description of the oral uptake, tissue dosimetry, and rates of metabolism of bromodichloromethane in the male rat.  
AB  - Bromodichloromethane (BDCM), a trihalomethane (THM) and water chlorination by-product, induces cancer in several tissues in experimental animals, including target tissue sites where increased incidences of human cancer have been linked to consumption of chlorinated water. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of vehicle of administration on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered BDCM and to further develop and validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to describe BDCM absorption, tissue dosimetry, and rates of metabolism for both oil and 10% Emulphor vehicles. Estimates of oral absorption rate constants were determined by fitting blood and exhaled breath chamber concentration-time curves obtained following gavage of male F344 rats with 50 or 100 mg BDCM/kg in corn oil or 10% Emulphor using a previously published multicompartmental gastrointestinal tract submodel (Semino et al., Toxicology 117, 25-33, 1997) linked to a PBPK model. Independently estimated oral uptake and metabolic rate constants accurately described kidney BDCM concentrations and plasma bromide ion levels without adjustment. This observation increases our confidence in model structure and values of parameter estimates. Liver BDCM concentrations were simulated, but with less accuracy than kidney dosimetry simulations, following incorporation of BDCM loss to metabolism during sample preparation. This model describes BDCM tissue dosimetry and metabolism following oral gavage and can be utilized in estimating rates of formation of reactive metabolites in target tissues. Estimates of tissue dosimetry and levels of toxic intermediates can be incorporated into a risk assessment model for BDCM-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between number of family risk factors during adolescence and three areas of psychosocial adjustment (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and academic achievement) in adolescence and 6 years later in young adulthood. Risk factors examined included parental divorce, interparental conflict, maternal physical health problems, maternal depressive mood, and mother-adolescent relationship difficulties. The findings indicated both concurrent and long-term associations between number of family risk factors and psychosocial adjustment; however, the results differed based on area of adjustment examined and whether concurrent or longitudinal data were considered. Furthermore, a steep increase in adjustment difficulties occurred when number of risk factors increased from three to four. The results are discussed in the framework of four hypotheses which were tested, and clinical implications are delineated.

TI  - Oral contraceptives and the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer. Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study Group [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general, but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer. METHODS: We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case-control study. All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 (179 women) or BRCA2 (28 women). The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation. Lifetime histories of oral-contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women, after adjustment for year of birth and parity. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.8). The risk decreased with increasing duration of use (P for trend, <0.001); use for six or more years was associated with a 60 percent reduction in risk. Oral-contraceptive use protected against ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation (odds ratio, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.9) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation (odds ratio, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: Oral-contraceptive use may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the benefits and difficulties of families caring for a dying child at home and to assess the parents' adjustment following their child's death. METHOD: Semi-structured interview and questionnaire. RESULTS: The benefits of home versus hospital care included greater freedom, more privacy and less disruption to family life, and that caring for the child was a positive experience for most families. Despite this experience many families expressed many fears and concerns about the symptomatic care of their children and requested more support. DISCUSSION: Hospital-based treatment teams have a responsibility to ensure adequate support can be provided before home care is recommended for dying children. The experience of home-based palliative care reported by these parents and their suggestions for change will assist all who care for dying children and to improve services supporting home-based palliative care.

TI  - Significance of ion transport during lung development and in respiratory disease of the newborn.  
AB  - Active ion transport plays a critical role in the liquid movement across the fetal and perinatal lung epithelium. The fetal lung liquid production is coupled with active secretion of Cl- into the luminal space. The potential for fluid absorbing mechanisms related to active Na+ transport from the apical to the basolateral side of the epithelium appears near the end of gestation. At birth there is a dramatic change of environment with commencement of air-breathing, sudden increase in oxygen partial pressure (PO2) and profound changes in the pulmonary circulation. A concurrent switch from fluid secretion to maintenance of low amounts of alveolar fluid is another major physiological adjustment taking place in the perinatal distal lung epithelium. The fluid-absorbing mechanism is a result of a well-synchronized co-operation between the basolateral membrane Na-K-ATPase and the apical membrane Na+ channels and it promotes salt and water movement from the airspace. Inability of the fetal lung epithelium to switch from fluid secretion to Na+ transport-dependent absorption seems to be an important factor adversely contributing to the respiratory distress of the newborn premature infant.

AB  - Using data from a national sample of 715 United States adoptive families, comparisons were made between adopted adolescents and birth adolescents (children born to the adoptive parents) on the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach), 8 psychological and behavioral adjustment factor scales from the Attitudes and Behaviors survey (Benson), and an identity scale (Search Institute). Multivariate, followed by univariate, analyses of variance showed significant differences between the 2 groups on the psychological factor scales of Licit Drug Use and School Adjustment. A subsample of nonclinically referred adopted adolescents were also compared to norms on the Youth Self-Report. Nonreferred adopted boys showed higher levels of adjustment than the norm group on Withdrawn behaviors. Nonreferred adopted girls showed better adjustment than the norm group on Social Problems and Withdrawn behaviors and poorer adjustment on Delinquent Behavior and Externalizing behavior. (Standardized effect sizes were in the small to moderate range.) These same patterns were evidenced when controlling for ethnicity. These data are examined within Brodzinsky's stress and coping model of adoptee adjustment and support a body of adoption research that finds a pattern of small but significant differences between adopted and nonadopted persons. The differences showing poorer adoptee adjustment in comparison to nonadoptees should not be overstated as is sometimes the case in the adoption clinical literature, and areas in which adoptees evidence higher levels of psychological functioning should be further researched.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This analysis was conducted to compare wintertime 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels of young women who did and did not use oral contraceptives (OC). METHODS: The subjects were 66 Caucasian women aged 20 through 40 recruited from the Boston area. Plasma 25OHD was measured in February or March and again 1 year later. Other measurements included height, weight and vitamin D intake from diet and supplements. RESULTS: The initial mean 25OHD level of the 26 OC users was 41% higher than those of nonusers before adjustment for age and vitamin D intake (83 +/- 40 (sd) nmol/L compared with 59 +/- 22), and 39% higher after adjustment (p = 0.003). Five women who discontinued OC use during the year following their initial measurement all had decreases in their 25OHD levels (mean change was -25.5 +/- 17.7 (SD) nmol/L), whereas levels in women whose OC use or non-use was constant did not change. CONCLUSION: OC use increases circulating levels of 25OHD, and should be considered when interpreting values obtained for clinical evaluation or nutrition research.

TI  -  Perceptual adjustment to time-compressed speech: a cross-linguistic study.  
AB  - Previous research has shown that, when hearers listen to artificially speeded speech, their performance improves over the course of 10-15 sentences, as if their perceptual system was "adapting" to these fast rates of speech. In this paper, we further investigate the mechanisms that are responsible for such effects. In Experiment 1, we report that, for bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, exposure to compressed sentences in either language improves performance on sentences in the other language. Experiment 2 reports that Catalan/Spanish transfer of performance occurs even in monolingual speakers of Spanish who do not understand Catalan. In Experiment 3, we study another pair of languages--namely, English and French--and report no transfer of adaptation between these two languages for English-French bilinguals. Experiment 4, with monolingual English speakers, assesses transfer of adaptation from French, Dutch, and English toward English. Here we find that there is no adaptation from French and intermediate adaptation from Dutch. We discuss the locus of the adaptation to compressed speech and relate our findings to other cross-linguistic studies in speech perception.

TI  - Respective role of the axial and appendicular systems in relation to the transition to limblessness.  
AB  - In lower quadrupedal vertebrates locomotor efficiency seems to result from the associate movements of the axial and appendicular systems, which are totally independent in structure and embryological origin. The curvature of the trunk, produced by a standing wave, magnifies the propulsive action of the limbs. In intermediate forms, the association of an elongate trunk with limbs reduced in size brings about functional consequences which may be noticeably diverse according to the degree of trunk elongation and limb reduction. According to environmental constraints, animals search for better locomotor efficiency, which implies the maintenance or breakage of this association of both locomotor systems. In some cases, limb action on the ground is added to the axial wave action through a perfect mutual adjustment of rhythmic activity, until mechanical inefficiency of the limbs is reached by possible loss of contact with the ground. In other cases, the limbs dragged on the ground during the stance phase act against the axial action or, on the contrary, are inhibited by the axial system. A review of available data tries to contribute to an understanding of the respective roles of both systems in the transition to limblessness.

TI  - Evaluation of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire: a comparison with SF-36 Health Survey in a cohort of Italian long-survival cancer patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the large amount of data available about the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, there have been very few studies focussed on long-survival cancer patients, and no data are available on its performance in the Italian setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within the framework of a project aimed at evaluating the characteristics of available HR-QOL questionnaires in the Italian language, the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire together with the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) were mail-administered to a sample of patients previously recruited in two large multicenter randomized clinical trials on early breast and colon cancers. The properties of the questionnaire were evaluated using standard psychometric techniques and correlation analyses with demographic and clinical independent variables. RESULTS: In the sample of patients who sent back the questionnaires under evaluation, the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed satisfactory acceptability (response rate = 64% and very low prevalence of missing at item and scale level), and the psychometric analyses confirmed the multi-dimensional conceptualisation in terms of convergent and discriminant validity. Moreover, EORTC QLQ-C30 scales showed substantial correlation with the homologous SF-36 scales. Few socio-demographic (age, gender, schooling) and clinical (type of cancer disease) variables were associated with HR-QOL. Breast cancer patients reported, on average, worse physical health-related scores, but after adjustment for age and education, most of the differences disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the validity and robustness of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in this sample of long-survival Italian cancer patients. Further ad hoc validation studies are required to evaluate its significance in these particular patients.

TI  -  Anticipatory postural adjustment and T'ai Chi Ch'uan.  
AB  - Recently much attention has focused on T'ai Chi Ch'uan as a method of improving balance and reducing the risk of falls in the elderly. Little has been done to determine the mechanism of these improvements. This study examined the effects of a sixteen week training program on anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). Eight subjects (median age 36.5) in good health, with no prior training in T'ai Chi were tested. The battery of tests included load dropping of 2.2 kg loads by the subjects standing on an unstable board placed on a force platform. The level and direction of instability were varied. The results show counterintuitive reductions in the APAs of several muscle groups while the stability of standing improved. We interpret the findings as an indication that practicing T'ai Chi leads to a greater use of the elasticity of the peripheral structures involving muscles, ligaments, and tendons while the participation of the central neutral structures in postural equilibrium is decreased.

TI  - Use of toenail fluoride levels as an indicator for the risk of hip and forearm fractures in women.  
AB  - The relation between fluoride intake and risk of osteoporotic fractures remains unclear. The lack of individual measures of long-term fluoride intake has limited epidemiologic studies. We used toenail fluoride in this study as a measure of long-term intake to evaluate the relation between fluoride intake and subsequent risk of hip and distal forearm fractures. Between 1982 and 1984, we collected toenail clippings from 62,641 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were free from cancer, heart disease, stroke, and previous hip or forearm fracture. We identified fracture cases (53 proximal femur and 188 distal forearm) through subsequent biennial mailed questionnaires and matched controls to cases on year of birth. The odds ratio of hip fracture among women in the highest quartile of toenail fluoride [ > 5.50 parts per million (ppm)], compared with those in the lowest quartile (> 2.00 ppm), was 0.8 (95% confidence interval = 0.2-4.0), with adjustment for menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, caffeine intake, and alcohol consumption. The corresponding adjusted odds ratio for forearm fracture was 1.6 (95% confidence interval = 0.8-3.1).  Further adjustment for body mass index, smoking status, and calcium and vitamin D intake did not alter these results.

TI  - Evaluation of dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry for body-composition assessment in rats.  
AB  - Recent developments in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) have rendered feasible the determination of whole-body composition in small laboratory animals by directly measuring fat, fat-free and mineral bone masses. Our aim was to evaluate this technique by cross-calibrating the DXA method with the carcass chemical analysis in a heterogeneous population of nondiabetic Wistar and diabetic GK rats (21 animals were used for precision error and reproducibility determinations and 26 were used for accuracy studies). We report that this technique is optimized for weights >200 g. The respective CV for lean mass, fat mass and percentage of fat mass determined in short-term or transversal studies was 1.1 +/- 0.1, 3.0 +/- 1.3 and 3. 1 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- SD) respectively. Further, this technique is valid for rats weighing from 130 to 200 g by using three successive scans. In longitudinal studies, daily calibrations significantly increased the percentage of fat mass CV to 6.6 +/- 3.3%, but it was significantly decreased to 3.0 +/- 2.7% by the use of triplicate scans. The accuracy for DXA was excellent in reference to the chemical extraction technique (r2 = 0.95 for percentage of fat mass, P < 0.0001), using an adjustment factor of 0.75 (limits of agreement between the two methods for percentage of fat mass = -1.7-2.3%). Mimicry of longitudinal changes in body composition with intraperitoneal injections of saline solution demonstrated a satisfactory detection of body component changes (</=2% of error for each final component analyzed, when increasing total lean mass by 11. 8%). We conclude that DXA is appropriate for rat whole-body composition determination, allowing reliable long-term follow-up of individual animals for the first time.

TI  - Bayesian calculation of methotrexate clearance after low dose intramuscular administration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine a pharmacokinetic procedure (Bayesian method) for estimation of methotrexate (MTX) clearance, using only 2 blood samples, in outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low dose intramuscular (i.m.) MTX. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by the weighted least squares (WLSQ) method in plasma samples from 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In each patient, 11 samples were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay, at Time 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after i.m. administration. These measures were validated by pharmacokinetic studies in 20 other patients with RA. Individual total body clearance of MTX was calculated using only 2 plasma samples (at 0.5 and 2 h after i.m. injection) by the Bayesian method using the population pharmacokinetic parameters. The clearance measures obtained by the Bayesian method were compared with those obtained by the WLSQ method. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic variables (clearance, half-life, area under the curve) of 14 patients were determined, as well as the covariance and the mean values necessary to apply the Bayesian method. No significant difference was found between clearance values obtained by the Bayesian method compared to the WLSQ method, confirming the validity of the Bayesian values. CONCLUSION: The present population pharmacokinetic parameters allowed the determination of individual clearance of MTX with only 2 plasma samples (0.5 and 2 h after administration) in patients treated with low dose im MTX. Individual clearance is used to modulate MTX administration in patients presenting adverse reactions in spite of good clinical response. Individual determination of MTX pharmacokinetics in patients at risk for adverse MTX reactions could be useful for adjustment of the drug regimen.

TI  - A conceptual framework for nursing management of pain.  
AB  - The development of specific nursing-based conceptual frameworks help to define and link ideas when performing studies involving a number of different concepts. Through the use of nursing models and frameworks, knowledge gained from nursing research can be more readily disseminated into nursing practice. The present framework encompasses nurses' knowledge and attitudes about pain management and incorporates the work of many theorists, the most prominent being that of Brenda Conrad. This pain management scheme expresses the belief that nurses have a unique and pivotal role in supporting and promoting optimum health states and providing quality life. It generates overall goals related to nurse assistance of the patient in the areas of recovery, independence, adjustment and treatment, and emphasises that to meet the patient's needs, nurses must possess adequate pain assessment and management knowledge as well as supportive attitudes to provide efficient quality care provision. The major supposition emphasised throughout this conceptual framework is that underlying nursing care is a grounded knowledge base fostering genuine care and concern for the welfare of the holistic patient.

TI  - Coronary event and case fatality rates in an English population: results of the Oxford myocardial infarction incidence study. The Oxford Myocardial Infarction Incidence Study Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine coronary event and case fatality rates in an English population aged less than 80 years in Oxfordshire, and to compare these rates with those reported by the UK monitoring trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease (MONICA) centres in Scotland and Northern Ireland and those ascertained in Oxfordshire in 1966-67. DESIGN: A population wide surveillance study conducted in 1994-95 using prospective and retrospective case ascertainment. SETTING: A resident population in Oxfordshire of 568,800. SUBJECTS: Patients with suspected myocardial infarction or coronary death. OUTCOME MEASURES: A diagnosis of definite or possible myocardial infarction or coronary death using WHO MONICA diagnostic criteria based on symptoms, electrocardiograms, cardiac enzymes, necropsy findings, and past medical history. RESULTS: The annual rate for a first or recurrent coronary event per 100,000 population aged less than 65 years in 1994-95 was 273 for men and 66 for women after age adjustment to a standard world population. Rates in the age group 65-79 years were 1350 for men and 677 for women. Between 1966-67 and 1994-95, the age standardised event rate in the age group 30-69 years decreased significantly by 33% (95% confidence interval (CI) 44 to 21) in men, and there was a non-significant reduction of 8% (95% CI -33 to 17) in women. The age standardised 28 day case fatality rates also decreased significantly by 28% (95% CI 41 to 15) in men and by 32% (95% CI 55 to 9) in women. CONCLUSIONS: The coronary event rate in Oxfordshire was much lower than rates reported by MONICA centres in Glasgow and Belfast, and similar to rates reported by MONICA centres in France and northern Italy. The substantially lower event rate accounts for lower coronary heart disease mortality in Oxfordshire than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The reduced coronary mortality in this region is attributable to declines in coronary event and case fatality rates.

TI  - [Association between the intima-media thickness of the common carotid and subsequent cardiovascular events in subjects, 55 years and older, in the Rotterdam study (ERGO)]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) is related to future cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: Nested case control study. SETTING: The suburb of Ommoord in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. METHOD: As part of the Rotterdam study among 7983 subjects aged 55 years and over, ultrasound images of the common carotid artery were stored on videotape of 5965 subjects at baseline (1990-1993). Analysis (logistic regression) was based on 190 cases of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke), registered up to December 31, 1994. IMT was measured from videotape for all cases and a control sample of 1373 subjects who remained free from myocardial infarction and stroke during follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 years. RESULTS: The age and sex adjusted cardiovascular disease risk increased by 45% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 25-69) per standard deviation increase (0.163 mm) in IMT. Stroke risk increased by 45% (95% CI: 25-69) per standard deviation increase and the risk of myocardial infarction increased by 43% (95% CI: 16-78).  Additional adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the association. CONCLUSION: Increased common carotid intima-media thickness was associated with subsequent cardiovascular events. These results support the use of carotid intima-media thickness measurements as a surrogate endpoint in observation and intervention studies. The value of IMT measurements for individual patients and cardiovascular screening merits further study.

TI  - Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers: risk factors and use of preventive devices.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are a frequent complication of bed rest. We examined risk factors for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers, the use of preventive devices, and the impact of case-mix adjustments on between-ward comparisons. METHODS: We conducted 3 cross-sectional surveys in a teaching hospital of 2373 patients who had no pressure ulcer on admission. We assessed the presence of pressure ulcer, dates of admission and ulcer occurrence, hospital ward, patient age and sex, appetite and route of nutrition, surgery during stay, hospitalization for fracture, comorbidities, use of low-pressure devices (special mattresses, cushions, and pressure-reducing beds), and the Norton Pressure Ulcer Prediction score (physical condition, mental condition, activity, mobility, and incontinence). RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven new pressure ulcers occurred (5.7 per 1000 person-days). In multivariate analysis, the risk for pressure ulcer increased with age (risk gradient across 5 categories was 1:4.5; P<.001) and Norton score (across 5 categories, risk gradient was 30-fold; P<.001); other risk factors (all relative risks, 1.5-1.8; P<.002) were hospitalization for fracture, surgical intervention, reduced appetite, and nasogastric tube or intravenous nutrition. Adjustment for case mix substantially modified differences between hospital wards. Use of preventive devices was associated with Norton score, but not all high-risk patients benefited. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure ulcers were seen in every 10th hospitalized adult. Patient age and Norton score were the strongest risk factors for pressure ulcers. Use of preventive devices was suboptimal.  Adjustment for case mix is essential if pressure ulcer incidence is to be used as an indicator of quality of care.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of an anemia treatment algorithm in hemodialysis patients.  
AB  - Current guidelines recommend maintaining the hematocrits of chronic hemodialysis patients in the low to mid-30s. Maintaining patients' hematocrits within a narrow range requires frequent monitoring of their hematocrits and iron studies and periodic adjustment of erythropoietin doses and administration of intravenous iron. We designed a simple anemia treatment algorithm to streamline the management of anemia in hemodialysis patients. The protocol required formal monthly decisions about the administration of intravenous iron or changes in erythropoietin dose. This algorithm was implemented by dialysis nurses and evaluated prospectively for 6 months in a single dialysis unit (30 patients). The proportion of patients whose hematocrits were within the desired target (31% to 35%) increased from 27% at baseline to 61% during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm. Conversely, the proportion of patients whose hematocrit values were below the target decreased from 46% at baseline to 18% during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm (P=0.004). The percentage of patients whose hematocrit values were above the target did not increase. The proportion of patients whose transferrin saturation was less than 18% decreased from 47% at baseline to 20% during months 4 through 6 of the algorithm (P=0.04). The weekly erythropoietin dose administered decreased from 11,200+/-1,400 units at baseline to 9,400+/-1,200 units in month 6 of the algorithm (P=0.06). We conclude that a simple anemia treatment algorithm implemented by dialysis nurses is feasible and efficacious and may increase the proportion of hemodialysis patients whose hematocrit values are within the target range, without increasing erythropoietin requirements.

TI  - Variation in bronchial responsiveness in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS).  
AB  - Attempts to compare bronchial responsiveness between populations have been hampered by between-study differences in the pharmacological agent of provocation, the method of administration and the summary statistic employed. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey used methacholine challenge delivered by Mefar dosimeter according to a standardized protocol used in 35 centres in 16 countries. Data were obtained from 13,161 men and women, aged 20-44 yrs at the start of the study. The dose of methacholine producing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (PD20) and the regression coefficient of percentage decline in FEV1 with log dose, were calculated ("slope", after transformation), with and without calibration of nebulizers by weight and adjustment for nonresponse bias. Standardization for baseline lung function and variation in smoking prevalence was applied to slope. Results were robust to whichever summary measure was used, and to the various adjustments. Responsiveness was low in Iceland and Switzerland, and in most centres in Sweden, Italy and Spain, and high in New Zealand, Australia, the USA, Britain, France, Denmark and Germany. Bronchial responsiveness varies considerably in Europe, and high levels are not confined to the English-speaking world.
