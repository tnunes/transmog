TI  - Mitochondrial DNA deletions associated with aging and presbyacusis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The membrane hypothesis of aging proposes an association between reactive oxygen metabolites and aging processes. Reactive oxygen metabolites are a normal by-product of oxidative phosphorylation and are also formed under conditions of ischemia, hypoperfusion, and as a result of environmental contaminants. Among the many detrimental activities of reactive oxygen metabolites, also known as free oxygen radicals, is direct damage to mitochondrial DNA. Progressive accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage renders cells unable to conduct oxidative phosphorylation reactions effectively, thereby leading to a bioenergetically deficient cell. Over time, mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates and leads to cellular dysfunction with subsequent organ failure, aging, and ultimately, death. This sequence forms the basis of the membrane hypothesis of aging. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the membrane hypothesis of aging may be involved in the development of presbyacusis. DESIGN: Fischer rats from 4 age groups were tested for auditory sensitivity using the auditory brainstem response. Brain, stria vascularis, and auditory nerve tissues were harvested and mitochondrial DNA was amplified to identify the highly conserved cytochrome b and ND1-16S ribosomal RNA segment of the NADH genes, as well as a 4834-base pair (bp) deletion associated with aging. SUBJECTS: Fischer rats (n=28) from 4 age groups were used: young (2-4 months [n=9]), mid-young (9-11 months [n=5]), mid-old (18-20 months [n=5]), and old (30-34 months [n=9]). RESULTS: The results demonstrate a progressive reduction in auditory sensitivity with age. The mitochondrial DNA studies identify a significant increase in the presence of the 4834-bp deletion in the aged subjects compared with the young. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise the possibility that the 4834-bp deletion may be associated with presbyacusis, as well as with aging.

TI  - Linkage between operator binding and dimer to octamer self-assembly of bacteriophage lambda cI repressor.  
AB  - Cooperative binding of the bacteriophage lambda cI repressor dimer to specific sites of the phage operators OR and OL controls the developmental state of the phage. Cooperativity has long been thought to be mediated by self-assembly of repressor dimers to form tetramers which can bind simultaneously to adjacent operators. More recently, we demonstrated that when free repressor dimers self-associate in solution, tetramer is an intermediate in a concerted assembly reaction leading to octamer as the predominant higher order species [Senear, D. F., et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6179-6189]. Even as a minority component in the assembly reaction, tetramer can account for pairwise cooperativity. In a similar manner, were it able to bind all three operators simultaneously, octamer could account for three-way cooperativity. In fact, based solely on repressor self-assembly, the naive prediction is that the repressor-OR interactions should be substantially more cooperative than they are. Evidently, there are unfavorable contributions to cooperativity from processes other than repressor self-assembly. Here, we focus on coupling between repressor self-association and operator binding as one possible unfavorable contribution to cooperativity. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was used to compare the dimer-octamer association reactions of a repressor dimer-OR1 complex and free repressor dimer. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to investigate OR1 binding to free dimers and dimers assembled as higher order species. The results of these experiments indicate a significant and salt-dependent unfavorable contribution generated by such coupling. Since the oligonucleotides used in these experiments are the size of single operator sites, this coupling is mediated by the protein, not by the DNA. This mechanism does not account for an additional, salt-independent, unfavorable contribution which we presume is transmitted via the DNA. Thus, unfavorable contributions generated by structural transitions in both macromolecules serve to moderate the effect of self-association alone. We speculate that this is a general feature of cooperative protein-DNA interactions.

TI  - Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma associated with chronic atrophic gastritis type A.  
AB  - We report a case of gastric neuroendocrine (NE) carcinoma associated with chronic atrophic gastritis type A (CAG/A) or reversed atrophic type gastritis. A 9 x 6 cm tumor was resected from the stomach to control pain in a 55-year-old Japanese woman with peritoneal dissemination and metastatic tumors of the liver and ovary. Histologically, the tumor was NE carcinoma which showed an organoid structure, but consisted of NE cells with overt cytological atypia and frequent mitotic activity. Multiple microcarcinoids and NE cell micronests (NECMs) were also observed in the atrophic non-neoplastic mucosa of the gastric body. CEA immunoreactivity and a high Ki-67 labeling index were characteristic features of the neoplastic NE cells of the carcinoma. Although most NE tumors arising from CAG/A are typical carcinoid tumors, the present case illustrates that a high-grade NE carcinoma can develop from diverse NE cell proliferation in association with CAG/A.

TI  - Clinical manifestations and predictors of survival in older women infected with HIV.  
AB  - To review the natural history of HIV infection in older women, a retrospective review of women enrolled in the HIV Outpatient Program based at the Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans was performed. Eighty-four of the women were at least 40 years of age. Older women were more likely to be diagnosed with selected psychosocial illnesses (e.g., injection drug use, alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, psychosis, dementia) compared with women <40 years of age. There was no association with age and other opportunistic processes or HIV-related symptoms, but cervical dysplasia and chlamydia cervicitis were less common in older women. In a multivariate proportional hazards model, characteristics predictive for death among older women included a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 (relative risk [RR], 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18, 6.86; p < .02), a diagnosis of an opportunistic process (RR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.24, 8.55; p < .02), antiretroviral combination therapy (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12, 1.13: p < .08), and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.07, 1.10; p < .06). HRT should be considered in the management of postmenopausal HIV-infected women for its known documented benefits shown in populations of persons not infected with HIV. Prospective studies to better evaluate risks and benefits of HRT in HIV-infected women are warranted.

TI  - Myocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio is a predictor of mortality in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac energy metabolism is impaired, as indicated by a reduction of the myocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio, measured noninvasively by 31P-MR spectroscopy. The purpose of this study was to test whether the phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio also offers prognostic information in terms of mortality prediction as well as how this index compares with well-known mortality predictors such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were followed up for 928+/-85 days (2.5 years). At study entry, LVEF and NYHA class were determined, and the cardiac phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio was measured by localized 31P-MR spectroscopy of the anterior myocardium. During the study period, total mortality was 26%. Patients were divided into two groups, one with a normal phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio (>1.60; mean+/-SE, 1.98+/-0.07; n=19; healthy volunteers: 1.94+/-0.11, n=30) and one with a reduced phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio (<1.60; 1.30+/-0.05; n=20). At re-evaluation (mean, 2.5 years), 8 of 20 patients with reduced phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios had died, all of cardiovascular causes (total and cardiovascular mortality, 40%). Of the 19 patients with normal phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios, 2 had died (total mortality, 11%), one of cardiovascular causes (cardiovascular mortality, 5%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly reduced total (P=.036) and cardiovascular (P=.016) mortality for patients with normal versus patients with low phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratios. A Cox model for multivariate analysis showed that the phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio and NYHA class offered significant independent prognostic information on cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The myocardial phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio, measured noninvasively with 31P-MR spectroscopy, is a predictor of both total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Colonization of transplant unit water supplies with Legionella and protozoa: precautions required to reduce the risk of legionellosis [published erratum appears in J Hosp Infect 1997 Nov;37(3):259]  
AB  - Organ transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed patients are known to be at increased risk of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease. Although the ecology of Legionella in hospital water storage and distribution systems (including a protozoonotic relationship with free-living protozoa) has been well documented, little is known regarding the quality of water supplied to high-risk units. Hot- and cold-water samples (two first draw and one run to waste for 5 min) were taken from 69 (85%) of the 81 United Kingdom organ transplant units (31 renal, 24 bone marrow, nine cardiopulmonary and five liver transplant units) and cultured for Legionella and protozoa. Legionella spp. were isolated from the water supplies of 38 (55%) units and Legionella pneumophila from 31 (45%). The blue-white fluorescent group of Legionella (Legionella gormanii, Legionella bozemanii and others) was isolated from 18 (26%) units. Free-living protozoa were isolated from 47 units (68%) and genera of the protozoa known to permit the intracellular growth of Legionella (PGIGL), from 40 units (58%). Possible associations between Legionella and the variables Protozoa; PGIGL; water pH; and circulating water temperature (recorded after running to waste for 5 min) were examined by logistic regression analysis. In cold-water supplies, a significant association was found between the isolation of Legionella and PGIGL (P = 0.032; OR = 1.81; 95% CI 1.1-3.1). In hot-water supplies, an inverse association was found between the isolation of Legionella and circulating water temperature (P = 0.034; OR = 1.0719 per degree C; 95% CI 1.0052-1.1432). (We failed to isolate Legionella when the circulating hot water was > 58 degrees C. No other associations were significant. We recommend the active surveillance of water quality in high-risk patient areas, and that transplant units, either with a history of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease, or where active surveillance indicates a persistently high Legionella colony count, take remedial action. The quality of cold water may be improved by provision of a dedicated supply taken directly from the incoming mains; and of hot water by the use of a dedicated calorifier, able to maintain a minimum circulating hot water return temperature of 60 degrees C.

TI  - Analysis of obstetric complications reported to the National Patient Insurance Association in Finland from 1987 to 1995.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The launch of the National Patient Insurance Association in 1987 offered a good starting point to evaluate obstetric claims in Finland. In order to obtain full compensation after patient injury, proof of malpractice is no longer required. Thus, the register of the Association offers a solid data base to analyze these injuries. METHODS: A nationwide descriptive study of obstetric claims reported to the National Patient Insurance Association from 1.5.1987 to 31.12.1995. The recorded statistical datafiles of the Association were used in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 801 obstetric claims were analyzed. This comprised 2% of all (n = 39189) claims during the same time period. Nearly all injuries leading to claims (683/801, 85%) occurred during delivery. In all, 156 (19.5%) claims resulted in compensation. The total sum of compensation paid was $ 1.3 million. Most often (30/80 37.5%) and highest compensation ($ 0.8 million) was paid due to delay in the diagnosis of fetal asphyxia. In all, 118 (0.3%) malpractice trials in court have arisen from all claims to the Association during the study period; only two (1.7%) resulted from obstetric causes. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that most common and serious obstetric complications are associated with delay in the diagnosis of fetal asphyxia. Thus, from both the legal and the medical points of view, pertinent fetal monitoring during delivery and umbilical artery blood gas analysis after delivery in all risk deliveries should be obligatory in all delivery units. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the patient insurance has effectively prevented obstetric malpractice trials in court.

TI  - Mechanism of inactivation of enveloped viruses by the biosurfactant surfactin from Bacillus subtilis.  
AB  - The antiviral activity of surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic and biosurfactant produced by Bacillus subtilis, was determined for a broad spectrum of different viruses, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2), suid herpes virus (SHV-1), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), feline calicivirus (FCV), murine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). In vitro experiments showed biphasic virus inactivation kinetics for enveloped viruses during treatment. Inactivation of enveloped viruses, especially herpes- and retroviruses, was much more efficient than that of non-enveloped viruses. For those viruses susceptible to its action, surfactin was active at 25 microM in medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Concentrations up to 80 microM of surfactin led to a titre reduction of >4.4 log10 CCID50/ml for HSV-1 in 15 min and for SIV and VSV in 60 min. The inactivation rate increased linearly with the incubation temperature by a factor 2.4/10 degrees C and logarithmically with the concentration. Serum components, probably proteins and/or lipids, influence the effective surfactin concentration. A disruption of the viral lipid membrane and partially of the capsid was observed by electron microscopy. These findings suggest that the antiviral action, postulated also in other investigations, seems to be due to a physicochemical interaction of the membrane-active surfactant with the virus lipid membrane. Surfactin may be useful for application in virus safety enhancement of biotechnological and pharmaceutical products. Copyright 1997 The International Association of Biological Standardization.

TI  - The epidemiology of functional psychoses of late onset [published erratum appears in Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 1998;248(2):110]  
AB  - For the functional psychoses of late life, epidemiological information comes from two sources: studies of persons who have reached psychiatric services; and surveys of elderly persons sampled from the general population. A conspectus of published data from both sources leads to the following conclusions: States phenomenologically similar to those found in clinics do occur in the community in non-trivial numbers. There is no notable divergence in the information obtained from clinical series and from population-based surveys. These states are more common in women, they become more common with increasing age and are sometimes associated with decline in cognitive performance or with degenerative changes in the brain revealed by neuroimaging. Genetic factors appear to be less important than in early-onset psychoses but remain ill-defined, and the roles of social isolation and disorders of personality have not yet been sufficiently elucidated. Both clinical and community-based studies have found an association with sensory impairment. The community-based data suggest that paranoid symptoms may be detectable at subclinical level, and an association between them and cognitive impairment is demonstrable in individuals who are not diagnosable cases either of psychosis or of dementia. Differences exist between late-onset paranoid psychoses and affective psychoses in symptomatology and response to treatment. These observations confirm the importance of the late-onset psychoses for research directed towards uncovering the origins of psychotic symptoms in any age group.

TI  - Heart function in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and mildly to moderately impaired renal function. An echocardiographic study.  
AB  - Left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic heart dysfunction have been reported in essential hypertension and in patients with chronic renal failure, treated with haemodialysis, but a close association with blood pressure (BP) level has not been uniformly documented. Thus, other factors could be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction. The aims of the present echocardiographic study were to investigate cardiac morphology and function in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis with mildly to moderately impaired renal function, and to study the relation between echocardiographic findings and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), BP and age. Twenty patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and 14 healthy controls, of the same age- and sex-distribution, were examined by 2D-, M-mode and pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography. In patients, GFR was determined as plasma clearance of Cr-EDTA. The patients had significantly thicker left ventricular (LV) posterior walls in end diastole (8.7 vs 8.1 mm, p < 0.05), and a higher LV mass index (106.5 vs 93.8 g/m2, p < 0.05). Systolic functional indices, i.e. LV fractional shortening and LV ejection fraction, were statistically significantly lower in patients than in controls (p < 0.05). LV diastolic function in patients was characterized by a statistically significantly lower early peak flow velocity (E-Vmax) (0.66 compared with 0.8 m/s) and early to late peak flow velocity ratio (E/A ratio) (1.07 vs 1.41), as well as E/A ratio of time velocity indices (VTI-E/A) (1.45 vs 1.99) (p < 0.05). The right ventricular filling indices showed a tendency towards a lower E-Vmax in patients (0.55 compared with 0.62 m/s, p = 0.1). In patients, statistically significant negative correlations were found between age and mitral E/A ratio (r = -0.76, p < 0.0001), as well as LV VTI-E/A(r = -0.81, p < 0.0001). The same trend was seen for the tricuspid E/A ratio. No statistically significant correlations were found in patients between mitral or tricuspid E/A ratio and GFR, BP, LV mass or heart rate. In conclusion: in a group of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and mildly to moderately impaired renal function, it was found by means of echocardiography that there was a higher LV mass index and decreased systolic function, when compared with healthy controls. In addition, the patients had diastolic dysfunction of primarily the left ventricle. The echocardiographic findings were not correlated to BP level or renal function. This suggests that factors other than GFR or BP per se might be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction, at an early stage.

TI  - The molecular basis of carcinogenesis: understanding the cell cycle clock.  
AB  - The cell cycle clock is the central controller of cell proliferation that governs the progress of the cell through its growth cycle, its exit from the active cycle, and its decision to differentiate. Components of the clock are found to be functioning in an aberrant fashion in many types of malignancies. Notable among these is the retinoblastoma protein, pRB, which acts to restrain proliferation in normal cells and suffers inactivation in many types of tumour cells. Its activity is controlled by D-type cyclins in various cell types. We have deleted one of these cyclins--cyclin D1--from the mouse germline and find that its absence leads to a limited range of defects including hypoplastic retinae and the inability of the mammary epithelium to respond to pregnancy-associated hormonal stimulation. Cyclin D1 is overexpressed in many human breast cancers, pointing to a highly specific association of this cell cycle clock component with mammary cell proliferation.

TI  - Influence of acute rejection episodes, HLA matching, and donor/recipient phenotype on the development of 'early' transplant-associated coronary artery disease.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplant-associated coronary artery disease (TxCAD) is the manifestation of chronic rejection in the cardiac allograft. Both immunological and nonimmunological factors contribute to its development. Stratification by the time of development of TxCAD has not been considered previously for an extensive transplant series and may provide a means for apportioning relative risk factors appropriately. Specifically, TxCAD that develops early may have a pathogenesis different from TxCAD that develops later; ie, immunological factors play a more significant role in early development of TxCAD compared with later forms of the disease or in recipients where it has not been found. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1980 and 1994, 550 heart transplant recipients with postmortem data or yearly angiograms, donor:recipient serological HLA typing, and biopsy data were reviewed. Recipients were divided into four groups: Very Early (<1 year), Early (1-2 years), Late (3-14 years), and None (clear angio >3 years). There was a significant association between the number of histologically proven acute rejection episodes within 3 months and at 1 year and the development of early TxCAD. The number of acute rejection episodes within 3 months and 1 year is also significantly related to freedom of development of TxCAD. There was no significant association between the mean number of mismatches for Class I or Class II antigens, nor could any Class I/II phenotype for recipient or donor be identified that exerted a protective or deleterious effect. A lack of any association or trend with HLA data is demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in pathogenesis between early and late TxCAD help define the importance of acute rejection in the etiology of chronic cardiac rejection. Stratification by time of development of TxCAD may provide further insight into defining the relative importance of other risk factors associated with the development of TxCAD. The lack of association with HLA data is discussed.

TI  - Clinical outcome after left ventricular surgical remodeling in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy referred for heart transplantation: short-term results.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Left ventricular partial ventriculectomy (LVPV), an unconventional operation to reverse some aspects of the cardiac remodeling, has been proposed for treatment of congestive heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (age 46+/-9 years) referred to heart transplantation underwent isolated LVPV or LVPV associated to valve annuloplasty. Patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV (15) or III (9) due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Functional class, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (radionuclide), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter, and fractional shortening (by echocardiography), and hemodynamic variables were determined. The mean follow-up was 474+/-174 days. Survival at 30, 180, and 365 days was 92+/-6%, 67+/-10%, and 63+/-10%, respectively. Nine patients died, and the cause was associated with arrhythmias in 4 patients. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameters before and at 23+/-14 days, 188+/-27, and 365+/-14.8 days of follow-up were 82.6+/-9.8, 68.9+/-7.8, 69.9+/-6.9, and 70+/-5.3 mm, respectively (P=0.0001). The left ventricular end-systolic diameters were 73.5+/-7.4, 55.9+/-7.5, 57.4+/-7.8, and 55+/-5.5 mm (P=.0001). Fractional shortenings were 13+/-3, 19+/-4, 18+/-5, and 22+/-2%, respectively (P=.0001). The left ventricular ejection fractions before and 18+/-14, 188+/-26, and 369+/-3.6 days after the surgery were 17.2+/-4.7, 24.5+/-8.3, 24.5+/-7.4, and 23.7+/-6.1%, respectively (P=.004). The right ventricular ejection fractions were 20.5+/-6.2, 27.9+/-8.4, 28.2+/-10.1, and 27.4+/-7.3% (P=0.02). Pressures were unchanged. There was improvement in cardiac index from 2.11+/-0.52 to 2.53+/-0.64 L/min (P=.0037). Norepinephrine blood levels reduced from 702+/-258 to 439+/-307 pg/mL (P=.001). Most surviving patients presented improvement in functional class. Sustained ventricular tachycardias were observed in 9 patients (38%). CONCLUSIONS: The left ventricular partial ventriculectomy may improve the left and right ventricular function, functional class, and cardiac output. These initial results were associated to high prevalence of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The ventriculectomy introduces the concept that reduction of left ventricular chamber diameter may improve cardiac function in heart failure. Further progress is necessary to improve the results and evaluate its proper role in the management of heart failure.

TI  - Lack of hepatotoxic effects of parenteral ketorolac in the hospital setting.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: No large controlled studies to date have examined the hepatic safety of parenteral ketorolac, which is used to treat acutely ill hospitalized patients who may be at greatest risk of liver injury. OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between the use of parenteral ketorolac and subsequent liver injury. METHODS: A nonexperimental cohort study conducted in 35 hospitals in the greater Philadelphia, Pa, region examined 10,272 courses of parenteral ketorolac (the exposed group) and 10,247 courses of parenteral opioid (the comparison group). Liver injury was defined by a modified international consensus definition that relied exclusively on liver function tests. Proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the rate ratio and 95% confidence interval for the association between ketorolac exposure and the occurrence of liver injury, controlling for potentially confounding factors, and to explore the possible effects of duration and dose. RESULTS: The incidence of liver injury was 1.0% in the ketorolac group and 1.2% in the opioid group, yielding an unadjusted rate ratio of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.59 1.01). Simultaneously adjusting for multiple potentially confounding factors did not change this result. There was no evidence for a duration-response relationship (P = .96) or a dose-response relationship (P = .23). We were unable to identify any subgroups that were susceptible to possible hepatotoxic effects of parenteral ketorolac. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to find evidence of a hepatotoxic effect of parenteral ketorolac use in the hospital setting and provides strong evidence against the existence of a clinically meaningful association between exposure to parenteral ketorolac in the hospital setting and liver injury.

TI  - Prognostic significance of myocardial ischemia detected by ambulatory electrocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, and electrocardiogram at rest to predict cardiac events by one year (the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot [ACIP] study) [see comments]  
AB  - Myocardial ischemia identified by ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG), exercising treadmill testing, (ETT), or 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest is associated with an adverse prognosis, but the effect of improving these ischemic manifestations by treatment on outcome is unknown. The Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study was a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute funded study to determine the feasibility of conducting a large-scale prognosis study and to assess the effect of 3 treatment strategies (angina-guided strategy, AECG ischemia-guided strategy, and revascularization strategy) in reducing the manifestations of ischemia as indicated by AECG and ETT. The study cohort for this database study consisted of 496 randomized patients who performed the AECG, ETT, and 12-lead electrocardiogram at rest at both the qualifying and week 12 visits. The effect of modifying ischemia by treatment on the incidence of cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or hospitalization for an ischemic event) at 1 year was examined. In the 2 medical treatment groups (n = 328) there was an association between the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic episodes at the qualifying visit and combined cardiac events at 1 year (p = 0.003). In the AECG ischemia-guided patients there was a trend associating greater reduction in the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemia episodes with a reduced incidence of combined cardiac events (r = -0.15, p = 0.06). In the revascularization strategy patients this association was absent. In the medical treatment patients the exercise duration on the baseline ETT was inversely associated with an adverse prognosis (p = 0.02). The medical treatment strategies only slightly improved the exercise time and the exercise duration remained of prognostic significance. In the revascularization group strategy patients this association was absent. Thus, myocardial ischemia detected by AECG and an abnormal ETT are each independently associated with an adverse cardiac outcome in patients subsequently treated medically.

TI  - Population genetics and disease susceptibility: characterization of central European haplogroups by mtDNA gene mutations, correlation with D loop variants and association with disease.  
AB  - Mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplogroups in a German control group (n = 67) were characterized by screening mitochondrial coding regions encompassing most of the ND, tRNA and cyt b genes. We used a PCR-SSCP screening approach followed by direct sequencing of polymorphic mtDNA fragments. Five major mtDNA lineages, diverging in at least nine different haplogroups, could be defined by characteristic polymorphic sites in mitochondrial genes. Additional sequencing of two hypervariable segments (HVS-I and II) of the non-coding displacement (D) loop in all control subjects revealed that certain D loop variants were strongly correlated with lineages and haplogroups, while others represented hotspots occurring frequently in different haplogroups. The existence of identified lineages and haplogroups received support from data in the literature, obtained by use of different approaches. Subsequently, we investigated four disease groups for association with these haplogroups: (i) LHON patients (n = 55) carrying at least one of the primary/intermediate LHON mutations at nt 3460, 11778, 14484 and/or 15257; (ii) patients suffering from Wolfram or DIDMOAD syndrome (n = 8); (iii) MELAS patients (n = 9); (iv) a group of children, who died from 'sudden infant death syndrome' (SIDS) (n = 9). The distribution patterns among the haplogroups of the disease groups (LHON, DIDMOAD and SIDS) differed considerably from the control population. LHON and DIDMOAD were significantly under-represented in the most frequent German haplogroup DC, but were concentrated in a mtDNA lineage defined by polymorphisms at nt 4216 + 11251 + 16126. As this lineage diverged into two precisely defined haplogroups, LHON and DIDMOAD could be assigned to the two haplogroups separately. Strikingly, SIDS was often found in association with two rare German haplogroups. MELAS patients were equally distributed among German haplogroups and, moreover, did not reveal any accumulation of specific D loop variants. We conclude that certain European mtDNA haplogroups define a genetic susceptibility basis for various disorders.

TI  - Minimal criteria for placement of adults on the liver transplant waiting list: a report of a national conference organized by the American Society of Transplant Physicians and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [see comments]  
AB  - This report summarizes a recent meeting cosponsored by the American Society of Transplant Physicians and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to formulate minimal criteria by which patients with severe liver disease will be placed on the waiting list for liver transplantation. The participants agreed that only patients in immediate need of liver transplantation should be placed on the waiting list. Patients should not be placed in anticipation of some future need for such therapy. It was agreed that minimal criteria could assist but not replace the clinical judgment of the transplant professionals at individual centers. The criteria will be summarized below for adult patients with acute or chronic liver disease. The most important non-disease-specific criterion for placement on the transplant waiting list was an estimated 90% chance of surviving 1 year. This translated into a Child-Pugh score of > or = 7 for patients with cirrhosis which places the patient in Child-Pugh class B or C. Cirrhotic patients who have experienced gastrointestinal bleeding caused by portal hypertension or a single episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis would meet the minimal criteria irrespective of their Child-Pugh score. There were disease-specific criteria also. These include a sole minimal criterion for patients with fulminant hepatic failure regardless of etiology of the onset of stage 2 hepatic encephalopathy. A requirement for 6 months abstinence from alcohol before placement on the transplant waiting list was considered appropriate for most patients with alcoholic liver disease. Exceptional cases could get access to the waiting list through a regional review process. Chronic cholestatic diseases present difficulties because of a different natural history than that of chronic hepatocellular diseases. The use of specific risk scores for primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis will likely replace Childs-Pugh classification as the scoring systems become refined. Minimal criteria for any patient with a primary hepatocellular cancer would admit any patient with a tumor confined to the liver irrespective of size or number of tumors, after careful investigation had failed to show spread to lymph nodes, the portal vein, or distant organs. Unusual or rare indications for liver transplantation, including Budd-Chiari syndrome, Wilson's disease, and other hereditary disorders, were also discussed. Finally, it was agreed that there should be no absolute contraindications to placement of patients on the liver transplant waiting list. These criteria should be open to regular review to accommodate advances in the field.

TI  - Effects of walking on mortality among nonsmoking retired men [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential benefit of low-intensity activity in terms of longevity among older men has not been clearly documented. We examined the association between walking and mortality in a cohort of retired men who were nonsmokers and physically capable of participating in low-intensity activities on a daily basis. METHODS: We studied 707 nonsmoking retired men, 61 to 81 years of age, who were enrolled in the Honolulu Heart Program. The distance walked (miles per day) was recorded at a base-line examination, which took place between 1980 and 1982. Data on overall mortality (from any cause) were collected over a 12-year period of follow-up. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, there were 208 deaths. After adjustment for age, the mortality rate among the men who walked less than 1 mile (1.6 km) per day was nearly twice that among those who walked more than 2 miles (3.2 km) per day (40.5 percent vs. 23.8 percent, P=0.001). The cumulative incidence of death after 12 years for the most active walkers was reached in less than 7 years among the men who were least active. The distance walked remained inversely related to mortality after adjustment for overall measures of activity and other risk factors (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in older physically capable men indicate that regular walking is associated with a lower overall mortality rate. Encouraging elderly people to walk may benefit their health.

AB  - The plasma concentration of leptin is reduced in association with chronic energy restriction and weight loss in humans, but little is known about the acute effects of fasting and glucose infusion on leptin. In this study, plasma leptin, insulin, glucose, and fatty acid concentrations were measured daily in 14 healthy, normal-weight, female volunteers aged 24 +/- 4 y with a body mass index (kg/m2) of 24.2 +/- 3.6 during a 4-d fast. The mean plasma leptin concentration decreased by 54 +/- 8% with fasting (P = 0.0006, ANOVA). In a stepwise-regression model, the change in leptin concentration with fasting correlated most significantly with the change in insulin (R2 = 0.48, P = 0.0057) and to a lesser extent with the change in body fat by bioimpedance analysis (R2 = 0.19, P = 0.03). Plasma leptin concentrations measured every 20 min from 2000 to 0800 on the fourth night of the fast did not show a time-dependent rise. A continuous intravenous infusion of 5% glucose providing 1414 +/- 323 kJ/d (338 +/- 78 kcal/d) was begun after 4 d of fasting in seven subjects who continued to fast for an additional 6 d. Within 24 h of the glucose infusion, leptin concentrations increased significantly by 80 +/- 52% (P < 0.05). These data show the sensitivity of plasma leptin concentrations to small changes in energy supply and suggest a basic role of substrate metabolism in the short-term regulation of leptin.

TI  -  Association between dietary fiber intake and the folate status of a group of female adolescents.  
AB  - The main objective of this study was to assess the association between dietary fiber intake and the folate status of Canadian female adolescents. We also assessed dietary folate intakes and evaluated the prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency in these subjects. Female adolescents aged 14-19 y (n = 224) were recruited and fasting blood samples were collected. Dietary intakes (3-d food record) were recorded and participants were classified as lactoovovegetarians, semivegetarians, or omnivores on the basis of food-consumption patterns assessed with food-frequency questionnaires. Fourteen percent, 17%, and 26% of lactoovovegetarians, semivegetarians, and omnivores, respectively, had dietary folate intakes below their predicted requirements; 1%, 4%, and 23%, respectively, had serum folate concentrations indicative of deficiency. Despite low dietary folate intakes and serum folate concentrations, few subjects had homocysteine concentrations indicative of deficiency, suggesting that the degree of folate depletion had not yet produced functional consequences. Most important, results suggest that the consumption of nonstarch polysaccharide is significantly associated with serum folate concentrations (P < 0.001). For each 1-g increase in nonstarch polysaccharide intake, a 1.8% increase in serum folate concentration is expected. In summary, we propose that an increase in nonstarch polysaccharide intake may promote the intestinal biosynthesis of folate, providing a complementary strategy to enhance the folate nutriture of humans.

In Study 1, 70 men and 202 women filled in the Cartoon-Attribution-Strategy Test (CAST) and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), then 1 year later, the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. In Study 2, 25 men and 35 women filled in the CAST and the RSE, then 4 months later, the UCLA Loneliness Scale. In both studies, a pessimistic avoidance strategy was associated with subsequent feelings of loneliness, even after controls for the level of self-esteem. Both an optimistic planning strategy and a self-serving attributional bias were negatively associated with feelings of loneliness among men but not among women.

TI  - Supply of in-patient medical services for elderly people and geographical variation in medical admissions in a health district in England.  
AB  - Geographical variation in the utilisation of in-patient medical services for elderly people in a health district in England was examined in relation to supply of in-patient geriatric medical care and indicators of need. An ecological study design based on electoral wards was used. The health district had a resident population of 67,919 aged 65 y or more and was divided into three localities, each with a different supply of in-patient medical services for elderly people. Locality A had a traditional model of geriatric medical care, Locality B an integrated model and Locality C an age-related model. Localities A and C also had a high provision of general practice hospital beds. The main outcome measure was the age and sex standardised hospital admission ratio for people aged 65 y or more admitted under geriatric medicine, general medicine or general practice in April 1991-March 1992. There were 8829 admissions in 1991/2, 48% in general medicine, 40% in geriatric medicine and 12% in general practice, giving an overall unadjusted admission rate of 130 per 1000 population aged 65 y or more for the three specialties combined. Locality A had the highest, and Locality B the lowest, unadjusted admission rate for the three specialties combined. This rate remained highest in Locality A if second and subsequent admissions in the same period were excluded. Lengths of stay in geriatrics were longest in this locality but lengths of stay for the three specialties combined were similar in the three localities. Multiple regression was used to examine the effect of three indicators of need, the Jarman score, standardised mortality ratio and prevalence of limiting long-term illness, on standardised admission ratios at the electoral ward level. Jarman score had a significant independent association with the standardised admission ratio but adjustment for this factor did not alter the ranking of the three localities, with the standardised admission ratio remaining highest in Locality A. Subject to the limitations of the study, the results suggest that factors related to the supply of in-patient medical services may be associated with geographical variation in medical admissions for elderly people.

TI  - Female gender and resistance to activated protein C (FV:Q506) as potential risk factors for thrombosis after elective hip arthroplasty.  
AB  - Resistance to activated protein C (APC) caused by the R506Q mutation in factor V is the most common inherited risk factor for venous thrombosis. To elucidate whether APC-resistance is a risk factor for venous thrombosis after elective total hip replacement, the association between APC-resistance (presence of FV:Q506 allele) and postoperative thrombosis was investigated in patients (n = 198) randomised to received short (during hospitalisation, n = 100) or prolonged prophylaxis (three weeks after hospitalisation, n = 98) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Among APC-resistant individuals receiving short prophylaxis, 7/10 developed thrombosis as compared to 2/12 receiving long prophylaxis (p <0.0179). Odds ratio for association between APC-resistance and thrombosis in the short prophylaxis group was 4.2 (CI 95% 1.02-17.5) (p <0.0465). Among those receiving prolonged prophylaxis, there was no increased incidence of thrombosis associated with APC-resistance. Two unexpected observations were made. One was that APC-resistance was much more common in women (19/109) than in men (3/89) (p <0.001). The other was that even women without APC-resistance were much more thrombosis-prone than men. Thus, 24/48 of women with normal FV genotype and short prophylaxis developed thrombosis vs 8/42 among men, p = 0.002. The increased risk of thrombosis associated with female gender and APC-resistance was neutralised by the prolonged treatment. In conclusion, among patients receiving short prophylaxis, female gender was found to be a strong risk factor for venous thrombosis. Even though APC-resistance appeared to be a risk factor for postoperative thrombosis, the uneven distribution of APC-resistance between men and women, taken together with the increased risk of thrombosis among women, precluded valid conclusions to be drawn about the association between APC-resistance and an increased risk of thrombosis. Our results suggest that prolonged prophylaxis with LMWH after hip surgery is more important for women than for men.

TI  - Antibody to GBV-C second envelope glycoprotein (anti-GBV-C E2): is it a marker for immunity?  
AB  - The clinical significance of GB virus C (GBV-C E2) antibody is under investigation. The prevalence rates of GBV-C RNA and antibody to GBV-C E2 glycoprotein were determined in a population of 123 Egyptian anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who had not been treated previously with interferon. Sera were tested for GBV-C RNA by the LCx assay (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and for GBV-C E2 antibody by enzyme immunoassay. GBV-C RNA was present in 11.4% of patients. GBV-C E2 antibody was detected in 55.9% of GBV-C RNA-negative patients and in 2.2% of GBV-C RNA-positive patients (P = 0.006). GBV-C RNA was associated significantly with a history of schistosomiasis (relative risk [RR] = 5.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-17.14, P < 0.005) but not with parenteral risk factors. The presence of GBV-C E2 antibody was not associated with age, gender, parenteral risk factors, schistosomal infection, or HCV viremia. The HCV genotype and level of viremia were similar in GBV-C anti-E2-positive and negative patients. There was a trend toward more severe histological disease with anti-E2 seropositivity (RR = 1.45, 95% CI 0.89-2.45, P = 0.11), an association which was independent of the evidence of schistosomiasis. It is concluded that GBV-C infection is common among HCV-infected Egyptian patients with CLD due to HCV infection. A significant negative correlation between the GBV-C viremia and GBV-C E2 antibody suggests that an antibody response is associated with viral clearance. This antibody response presumably occurs spontaneously, as none of the patients had received antiviral therapy.  The unexpected association between GBV-C RNA and schistosomiasis suggests that nonparenteral or occult parenteral routes of GBV-C infection are likely to be important.

TI  - Interaction of a G-protein beta-subunit with a conserved sequence in Ste20/PAK family protein kinases.  
AB  - Serine/threonine protein kinases of the Ste20/PAK family have been implicated in the signalling from heterotrimeric G proteins to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste20 is involved in transmitting the mating-pheromone signal from the betagamma-subunits (encoded by the STE4 and STE18 genes, respectively) of a heterotrimeric G protein to a downstream MAP kinase cascade. We have identified a binding site for the G-protein beta-subunit (Gbeta) in the non-catalytic carboxy-terminal regions of Ste20 and its mammalian homologues, the p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs).  Association of Gbeta with this site in Ste20 was regulated by binding of pheromone to the receptor. Mutations in Gbeta and Ste20 that prevented this association blocked activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Considering the high degree of structural and functional conservation of Ste20/PAK family members and G-protein subunits, our results provide a possible model for a role of these kinases in Gbetagamma-mediated signal transduction in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.

AB  - AIMS: To examine the outcome of cardiac surgery and resulting intensive care admission in elderly (> or = 75 years) cardiac surgery patients at Waikato Hospital, 1991 to 1995. METHODS: Clinical records of all elderly cardiac surgery patients admitted to the intensive care unit were reviewed. All survivors were sent a postal questionnaire evaluating cardiac related symptom control and quality of life (QOL). Outcomes in the 'old' (75-79 years) and in the 'very old' (> or = 80 years) were compared. RESULTS: Seventeen of 97 patients had died. Mean survival time was 32.2 months. Survivor followup (100%) was at a mean of 34.8 months. Mean functional class (New York Heart Association or Canadian Cardiovascular Society) improved from 3.0 preoperatively to be 1.7. Cardioactive medications fell by a mean of 0.7 drugs per patient. Twenty-seven percent of survivors became more dependent as assessed by domicile type. Outcomes between the two groups were not different except for some improved individual changes in functional class. The 'very old' group have a similar postoperative QOL to that of the 'old' group. Ninety-two percent of survivors indicated that they would opt for cardiac surgery again if given the time over. CONCLUSIONS: Following cardiac surgery and intensive care admission at Waikato Hospital, surviving elderly patients have experienced a favourable outcome in terms of symptom control and quality of life. Mortality rates are acceptably low.

TI  - "Letting go": the dissolution of a voluntary organization ... and the lessons learned.  
AB  - Like other businesses in North America, the Canadian health care system is undergoing significant and widespread change. It is inevitable in these times that some organizations, some structures, some units will become irrelevant in their existing forms, and should be fundamentally altered, or discontinued altogether. The need for such decisions is too often resisted, denied or avoided. Voluntary organizations and associations are particularly vulnerable to the forces of change and transition. These organizations are as likely as any other to need reexamination, and perhaps even more likely to "miss the signals" heralding a need for redesign. There aren't many examples of voluntary groups which have either discontinued their operations, or radically changed their mandates; the Toronto Association for Quality in Health Care (TAQHC) is one such organization. It is the authors' hope that by sharing TAQHC's decision and process for dissolution we may be able to assist other organizations facing similar challenges. It is further our belief that many of the lessons learned from this experience are applicable to situations other than those of voluntary organizations.

TI  - Regulation of protein synthesis by minigene expression.  
AB  - Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth), an enzyme essential for Escherichia coli viability, scavenges peptidyl-tRNA released during abortive polypeptide chain elongation. Bacterial strains of E coli partially defective in Pth activity are unable to maintain bacteriophage lambda growth. Phage mutations that overcome the bacterial defect have been located to several regions in the lambda genome named bar. Plasmid constructs expressing just the bar region are toxic and cause a general arrest of protein synthesis in Pth-defective cells. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence from two bar regions reveals the short coding sequence AUG AUA Stop, spaced by an AT-rich segment from a Shine Dalgarno-like sequence (S-D). These sequences have been named minigenes. Base changes altering the putative S-D, the two sense codons, or the stop codon have been found to reduce Bar-toxicity. Transcripts containing bar function as mRNA. Upon expression in pth mutants, wild-type (bar+) transcripts are found associated with ribosomes. In addition, bar+ RNA forms ternary complexes with the 30S ribosomal subunit and the initiator tRNA and can be released upon run-off translation in the same way as an authentic mRNA. A cell free system for protein synthesis reproduces the in vivo effects: bar+ expression inhibits protein synthesis, bar+ RNA sequences are associated with ribosomes in the inhibited extracts, addition of purified Pth restores synthesis, and excess of tRNA(Lys), specific for the last sense codon in a mutant toxic minigene, prevents protein synthesis inhibition. Also, bar expression promotes association of methionine with ribosomes possibly in a translation complex. These results are consistent with a model proposing tRNA starvation to explain the behaviour of a pth mutant, thermosensitive for protein synthesis.

Two hundred and one respondents completed self-report measures of schizotypal traits as well as measures of religiosity developed, on the basis of theoretical work on the nature of delusional thinking, to tap the dimensions of preoccupation, guidance, conviction, and emotional involvement. For women, no associations were found between scores on the religiosity and schizotypy scales. For men, however, higher scores on religious preoccupation were associated with higher scores on magical ideation. It would seem that religiosity is not clearly associated with schizotypal traits.

To investigate associations between plasma IGF levels and prostate cancer risk, a nested case-control study within the Physicians' Health Study was conducted on prospectively collected plasma from 152 cases and 152 controls. A strong positive association was observed between IGF-I levels and prostate cancer risk. Men in the highest quartile of IGF-I levels had a relative risk of 4.3 (95 percent confidence interval 1.8 to 10.6) compared with men in the lowest quartile.  This association was independent of baseline prostate-specific antigen levels. Identification of plasma IGF-I as a predictor of prostate cancer risk may have implications for risk reduction and treatment.

TI  -  Association of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins and C4b binding protein with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins of human plasma.  
AB  - The triglyceride (TG) concentration in plasma is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. There is evidence that TG-rich lipoprotein (TGRLP), ie, chylomicrons (CMs), chylomicron remnants (CMRs), and VLDLs associate with factor VII and prothrombin and that the association enhances a platelet factor Xa-mediated prothrombin activation when the CM-prothrombin complex is exposed to platelets. In this study, we examined the association of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin, as well as the anticoagulation protein C and its cofactor protein S, in plasma lipoproteins obtained from human fasting and postprandial plasma. We also analyzed some other proteins that are related to the coagulation system but not to vitamin K-dependent proteins, including factor V, serum amyloid P component (SAP), C4b binding protein (C4BP), and thrombomodulin (TM), and as a control, Ig G. Human TGRLP (d < 1.006 kg/L), LDL (d = 1.006 to 1.063 kg/L), and HDL (d = 1.063 to 1.210 kg/L) were separated from normal subjects both in fasting and 2 to 3 hours after the ingestion of a meal containing 100 g fat. The different coagulation proteins, SAP, C4BP, TM, and Ig G were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with Western blotting, using specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, and were visualized by peroxidase staining. All the vitamin K-dependent proteins associate with TGRLP in both fasting and postprandial plasma, but not with LDL or HDL. Factor V, SAP, TM, and Ig G were not found in any lipoprotein classes. C4BP, which is a regulatory protein of the classic pathway of the complement system and which binds protein S in vivo to regulate blood coagulation, was present in TGRLP, especially postprandial, but not in LDL or HDL. The amounts of prothrombin, protein S, and C4BP in postprandial TGRLP were larger than those in fasting TGRLP. Vitamin K-dependent procoagulation and anticoagulation proteins, as well as C4BP, could be associated with TGRLP in vivo. If the association enhances prothrombin activation, this effect may thus be counteracted by simultaneous binding of protein S.

TI  - Bovine leukemia virus-gp51 antigen expression is associated with CD5 and IgM markers on infected lymphocytes.  
AB  - Cows that develop a persistent lymphocytosis (PL) as a result of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection develop massive proliferation of B-lymphocytes expressing both IgM and CD5 markers. The association of these two markers on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from BLV-infected cows and also expressing BLV-gp51 antigen marker on these cells was determined by three-color cytometric analysis. After in vitro cultivation of PBMC in the presence of PHA for 24 h, the mean percentages of marker-reactive cells of five PL+ cows were as follows; 43% +/- 4.5 of the PBMC expressed BLV-gp51 antigen; 90% +/- 1.6 of these cells expressed both IgM and CD5 at the same time, whereas but 7.5% +/- 1.9 expressed only IgM and 2.9% +/- 0.4 expressed only CD5. The PBMC, IgM positive cells accounted for 77.8% +/- 6.8, while both CD5 and BLV-gp51 were detected simultaneously on 52.0% +/- 2.4 of the IgM+ cells, while the CD5 marker and BLV-gp51 antigen were detected independently on 35.0% +/- 1.9 and in 9.0% +/- 3.1, respectively of the IgM+ cells. Of the CD5+ cells (equivalent to 75.5% +/- 9.0 of the PBMC), 54.7% +/- 4.7 expressed simultaneously IgM and BLV-gp51, while BLV-gp51 and IgM were expressed separately by 3.0% +/- 0.5 and 37.8% +/- 3.3, respectively.  An association between the B-cell phenotype and BLV tropism might exist. It is also possible that cells bearing both IgM and CD5 markers are the main target cells for BLV infection.

TI  - The value of Hughes-Cardiff classification in the management of perianal Crohn's disease.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the value of Hughes' pathogenic classification in the prognosis and management of perianal Crohn's disease (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This classification differentiates between purely inflammatory lesions and their mechanical or septic complications, and defines the presence of ulceration (U), fistula (F) and stricture (S), which are assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2 according to the severity and associated conditions, proximal intestinal involvement and disease activity (A, P and D). Of a series of 96 patients with CD, 12 underwent 16 procedures involving anesthesia to treat symptomatic anal lesions. Patients presenting with severe pain were explored and treated by surgical drainage or, in cases in which there was no demonstrable sepsis, by gentle dilation or infiltration with steroids. For superficial, non-specific fistulas, conventional fistulotomy was performed, and long-term seton drainage was implanted for complex fistulas. Strictures were treated by gentle dilation. Uncontrolled sepsis or proctocolitis was managed by proximal stoma creation or proctocolectomy. RESULTS: The association of cavitating ulcers (U2) and contiguous active rectal involvement (P1) was a contraindication for rectal preservation, making proctectomy or stoma creation the most feasible therapeutic option. The etiology of most, but not all, complex fistulas (F2) was the progressive cavitation of U2, whilst F1 was either of cryptoglandular origin or the result of epithelialized fissures (U1). The treatment was also adjusted to this association, and it was confirmed that most of the severe lesions (F2) and S2) were secondary to U2. CONCLUSIONS: Hughes' pathogenic classification: 1) makes it possible to set up an easily stored registry of anal and perianal Crohn's disease; 2) identifies predefined lesions, allowing the individualization of therapeutic procedures and the comparison of results, and 3) provides prognostic information.

TI  - [The interrelationship between lung functional disorder and blood transfusion]  
AB  - Interrelationship was studied of the haemotransfusion volume with the purpose of correcting the oxygen-transport to functional inadequacy of the lungs, inadequate patency of the organ's vessels in patients presenting with abdominal haemorrhage. Transfusion of donor blood was accompanied in some cases by pulmonary function disorders manifested by development of pneumonia. The larger the volume of haemotransfusion, the higher probability for lung function impairement. But we failed to find an immediate association between the volume of the donor blood transfused, blood flow and ventilation in the lungs. A conclusion was drawn to the effect that there exist secondary mechanisms of injury to the organ and development of pneumonia. Of these, weakening of immunologic resistance because of donor blood is considered to be most probable mechanism contributing to the above injury.

TI  - Characterization of the DNA-binding domain of the avian Y-box protein, chkYB-2, and mutational analysis of its single-strand binding motif in the Rous sarcoma virus enhancer.  
AB  - chkYB-2 is a sequence-specific, single-stranded DNA binding chicken Y-box protein that promotes Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR)-driven transcription in avian fibroblasts. The DNA-binding domain of chkYB-2 has been mapped by characterizing the DNA binding properties of purified recombinant chkYB-2 mutant polypeptides. The data indicate that the invariant cold shock domain (CSD) is necessary but not sufficient for association with DNA and suggest that another conserved region, adjacent to the carboxyl boundary of the CSD, plays a role in high-affinity DNA binding. chkYB-2 binds to a tandem repeat of the 5'-GTACCACC-3' motif on the RSV LTR. Mutational analysis of this recognition sequence revealed the requirement of an essentially unaltered template for both high-affinity binding by chkYB-2 as well as maximal transcriptional activity of the RSV LTR in vivo. The single-stranded DNA binding activity of chkYB-2 is augmented by Mg2+. The possible significance of this finding for transactivation by a single-strand DNA binding protein is discussed.

TI  - Hepatic uptake of hippurate: a multiple-indicator dilution, perfused rat liver study.  
AB  - The hepatic transport of hippuric acid (HA), a glycine-conjugated metabolite of benzoic acid that exhibits only modest plasma albumin binding (binding association constant of 2.1 x 10(3) M-1), was studied in the single-pass perfused rat liver (12 ml/min), using the multiple indicator dilution (MID) technique. The venous recovery of [3H]HA on portal venous injection of a MID dose containing a mixture of a set of noneliminated reference indicators and [3H]HA revealed a survival fraction of unity, corroborating the lack of disappearance of bulk HA from plasma. When the outflow recovery was fitted to the barrier-limited model of Goresky et al. (C.A. Goresky, G. G. Bach, and B. E. Nadeau. J. Clin. Invest. 52: 991-1009, 1973), the derived influx (P(in)S) and efflux (P(out)S) permeability-surface area products were found to be dependent on the concentration of HA (1-930 microM); P(in)S and P(out)S were approximately 3.5 times the plasma flow rate at low HA concentration, but decreased with increasing HA concentration. All values, however, greatly exceeded the expected contribution from passive diffusion, because the equilibrium distribution ratio of chloroform to buffer for HA was extremely low (0.0001 at pH 7.4). The tissue equilibrium partition coefficient (P(in)/P(out), or ratio of influx to efflux rate constants, k1/k-1) was less than unity and decreased with concentration. The optimized apparent Michaelis-Menten constant and maximal velocity were 182 +/- 60 microM and 12 +/- 4 nmol.s-1.g-1, respectively, for influx and 390 +/- 190 microM and 29 +/- 13 nmol.s-1.g-1, respectively, for efflux. In the presence of L-lactate (20 mM), however, P(in)S for the uptake of HA (174 +/- 3 microM) was reduced. Benzoic acid (10-873 microM) was also effective in reducing hepatic uptake of HA (5.3 +/- 0.9 microM). These interactions suggest that MCT2, the monocarboxylate transporter that mediates the hepatic uptake of lactate and other monocarboxylic acids, may be involved in HA transport.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase 9 level predicts optimal collagen deposition during early wound repair in humans [published erratum appears in Br J Surg 1998 May;85(5):715]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined two matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their association with deposition of collagen during wound repair. METHODS: In 15 hernia wounds, wound fluid was collected using two Cellstick devices, which were implanted adjacent to two expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tubes. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were analysed 24 and 48 h after operation using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and collagen deposition in the ePTFE tubes was measured 10 days after operation as hydroxyproline. RESULTS: The levels of both MMPs in wound fluid were increased compared with those of control serum, although MMP-9 decreased (P < 0.01) in the wounds 24-48 h after operation. The MMP-9 level at 24 h correlated inversely and specifically to deposited collagen measured as hydroxyproline (rs = -0.80, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the level of MMP-9 in the early inflammatory phase can predict the amount of collagen deposited later in the wound healing process.

TI  - Hydrostatic pressure shows that lamellipodial motility in Ascaris sperm requires membrane-associated major sperm protein filament nucleation and elongation.  
AB  - Sperm from nematodes use a major sperm protein (MSP) cytoskeleton in place of an actin cytoskeleton to drive their ameboid locomotion. Motility is coupled to the assembly of MSP fibers near the leading edge of the pseudopod plasma membrane. This unique motility system has been reconstituted in vitro in cell-free extracts of sperm from Ascaris suum: inside-out vesicles derived from the plasma membrane trigger assembly of meshworks of MSP filaments, called fibers, that push the vesicle forward as they grow (Italiano, J.E., Jr., T.M. Roberts, M. Stewart, and C.A. Fontana. 1996. Cell. 84:105-114). We used changes in hydrostatic pressure within a microscope optical chamber to investigate the mechanism of assembly of the motile apparatus. The effects of pressure on the MSP cytoskeleton in vivo and in vitro were similar: pressures >50 atm slowed and >300 atm stopped fiber growth. We focused on the in vitro system to show that filament assembly occurs in the immediate vicinity of the vesicle. At 300 atm, fibers were stable, but vesicles often detached from the ends of fibers. When the pressure was dropped, normal fiber growth occurred from detached vesicles but the ends of fibers without vesicles did not grow. Below 300 atm, pressure modulates both the number of filaments assembled at the vesicle (proportional to fiber optical density and filament nucleation rate), and their rate of assembly (proportional to the rates of fiber growth and filament elongation). Thus, fiber growth is not simply because of the addition of subunits onto the ends of existing filaments, but rather is regulated by pressure-sensitive factors at or near the vesicle surface. Once a filament is incorporated into a fiber, its rates of addition and loss of subunits are very slow and disassembly occurs by pathways distinct from assembly. The effects of pressure on fiber assembly are sensitive to dilution of the extract but largely independent of MSP concentration, indicating that a cytosolic component other than MSP is required for vesicle-association filament nucleation and elongation. Based on these data we present a model for the mechanism of locomotion-associated MSP polymerization the principles of which may apply generally to the way cells assemble filaments locally to drive protrusion of the leading edge.

TI  - BCL-2 expression correlates with lower proliferative activity in the intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Southwest Oncology Group cooperative laboratory study.  
AB  - An inverse relationship between BCL-2 expression and cell cycle transition has been suggested by recent studies in murine models. To investigate the clinical relevance of these laboratory studies, a group of 116 paraffin-embedded non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) biopsy specimens (Working Formulation Groups D-H, and J) from a cooperative group study of cellular DNA content were analyzed for the 14;18 translocation using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods and, if sufficient tissue remained, for BCL-2 and BAX expression by immunohistochemistry. The results of these studies were then compared with the results of the previously performed flow cytometric analysis of ploidy and proliferative activity (S-phase-fraction). BCL-2 expression was inversely associated with proliferative activity (P = .001; n = 41), but there was no association between staining for Bax and %S-phase. Ploidy was not associated with either BCL-2 or BAX expression. The t(14;18) was detected in 21 of the 54 cases in which PCR-amplifiable DNA was recovered; 20 of these occurred at the major breakpoint region and 1 at the minor breakpoint region. High levels of BCL-2 or BAX expression occurred independently of t(14;18). There was no association between t(14;18) and either ploidy or proliferative activity. The inverse relationship between BCL-2 expression and proliferative activity in the intermediate- and high-grade NHLs is consistent with recent studies suggesting that Bcl-2 both retards entry into the cell cycle and inhibits apoptosis.

TI  - Inactivation of a common epitope responsible for the induction of antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary antigenic domain responsible for complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (C'-ADE) of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus resides in the principal immunodominant sequence of the transmembrane protein. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether there are amino-acid residues common to the epitopes of the known enhancing human monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and to provide a structural model for this functional region present on the HIV envelope. Since our model predicts that this region is involved in the association of gp120 with gp41, this association was monitored for each mutant. DESIGN: The binding of enhancing human MAb to point and deletion mutations within the enhancing domain was analyzed by two methods. The first analyzed binding to mutants expressed in COS cells: the second quantified the binding of four enhancing human MAb to each mutant gp160 versus wild-type control by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce specific deletions and point mutants, which were expressed in COS cells. Binding of MAb 50-69 and V3-loop MAb 5F7 were visualized in the wild-type and each of the mutant constructs by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative evaluation of enhancing human MAb binding to each mutant versus wild-type was performed by ELISA. A model for the enhancing domain and its relationship to gp120 association with gp41 was provided by molecular dynamics and ligand docking methods. RESULTS: All available enhancing human MAb known to bind to the principal immunodominant region of gp41 were unable to bind to deletions involving the disulfide loop, which in our molecular model provided the primary association site between gp120 and gp41. Point mutations in the loop blocked this association, but had a quantitatively smaller effect on the binding of the enhancing human MAb. A conservative W596Y mutation completely blocked the binding of all human MAb, but had no effect on gp120-gp41 association. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of mutations within the primary C'-ADE domain inhibit binding of enhancing human MAb as well as blocking the association of gp120 and gp41. A conservative W596Y mutation blocks binding of all enhancing human MAb with retention of gp120-gp41 association. These data are important to the design of vaccines in which the primary enhancing epitope is disarmed to prevent the subsequent induction of an amnestic response that could lead to viral enhancement of infection. The retention of the gp120-gp41 association is postulated to yield an immunogen similar to natural infection for both subunit and genetic vaccines.

In the current series a repair with Mitek anchors was found to be a simple and reliable fixation that could be performed through a single anterior approach with minor risks of radial nerve damage. If a two-incision technique following Boyd and Anderson is used, the ulna should not be exposed in order to avoid a radioulnar synostosis; splitting the extensor muscle mass is preferable to a subperiostal ulna dissection, and the wound should always be drained to decrease the likelihood of hematoma formation.

AB  - The causes of the significant increases in the sensitivity to of clastogenic effect of thio-TEPA in bone marrow cells of inbred CBA/LacY mice were studied. The increases were shown to be associated with decreased fertility. The fluctuations of fertility and the association of fertility and sensitivity with thio-TEPA were analyzed in foundation stocks (FSs) for 24 and 6 inbred generations, respectively. The stocks examined were obtained in the Laboratory of Experimental Biological Models and the Stolbovaya breeding facility. The correlation analysis revealed a significant association of fluctuations of the coefficient of fertility in two FSs (eta = 0.78 +/- 0.13) and a high negative correlation between fertility and mutagen sensitivity in inbred generations (r = -0.91 +/- 0.21). The comparison between the fluctuations of fertility for four generations revealed the same fluctuation period in CBA/LacY, DBA/2Y, and C57Bl/6JY mice. The detected phenomena were assumed to result from genetically determined regular fluctuations in genome functioning. This explained a number of observations and allowed several prognoses to be made.

TI  - Human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus in epithelial carcinomas of the head and neck region.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. However, studies of the subject show considerable variation in their results, and the causal relationship between HPV and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck area still remains to be determined. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is consistently detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma lesions, but little is known about its association with other carcinomas of the head and neck region. The present study was carried out on the role of HPV and EBV in epithelial carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material comprised 79 frozen biopsy samples from epithelial head and neck carcinomas. DNA was extracted from frozen biopsy samples for analysis using Southern blot hybridization (SBH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HPV DNA. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 13 samples (16.5%) by SBH under low stringency conditions and in three samples (3.8%) by PCR using general primers targeting the HPV L1 region. HPV seemed to have affinity for labial carcinomas: four of the six samples (66.7%) were HPV DNA positive. The detection rate of HPV diminished from the labial and oral epithelium towards the laryngeal region. In SBH, EBV DNA was not found in any of the biopsy samples. CONCLUSIONS: HPV seems to be involved in multifactorial carcinogenesis in the head and neck epithelium, but the association is not as evident as that found in genital carcinomas. The results suggest that EBV is not associated with sporadic nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

TI  - Obesity, health services use, and health care costs among members of a health maintenance organization.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is an independent risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases and is therefore a potential source of avoidable excess health care expenditures. Previous studies of obesity and health care costs have used group level data, applying estimates of population-attributable risks to estimates of US total costs of care for each obesity-related disease. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association between body mass index (BMI) and health services use and costs stratified by age and use source at the patient level, a level of detail not previously reported. METHODS: In 17,118 respondents to a 1993 health survey of members of a large health maintenance organization, we ascertained through computerized databases all hospitalizations, laboratory services, outpatient visits, outpatient pharmacy and radiology services, and the direct costs of providing these services during 1993. RESULTS: There was an association between BMI and annual rates of inpatient days, number and costs of outpatient visits, costs of outpatient pharmacy and laboratory services, and total costs (P < or = .003). Relative to BMI of 20 to 24.9, mean annual total costs were 25% greater among those with BMI of 30 to 34.9 (rate ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.41), and 44% greater among those with BMI of 35 or greater (rate ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-1.71).  The association between BMI and coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes largely explained these elevated costs. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of obesity and the associated elevated rates of health services use and costs, there is a significant potential for a reduction in health care expenditures through obesity prevention efforts.

TI  - Rate of FEV1 change following lung volume reduction surgery.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) improves pulmonary function and dyspnea symptoms acutely in selected patients with heterogeneous emphysema. Limited data are available regarding long-term function following LVRS. We analyzed short-term (<6 months) and long-term rate of change of pulmonary function in 376 patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral LVRS using thoracoscopic or median sternotomy, staple, laser, or combined techniques. We hypothesized that the long-term rate of deterioration in lung function would be dependent on the surgical procedure used and would be greatest in those with the largest short-term postoperative improvement. METHODS: Pulmonary function was assessed preoperatively and at repeated intervals following LVRS. The change in pulmonary function over time was assessed for each patient by determining the individual change in FEV1 using linear regression analysis short and long term. Overall rate of change in pulmonary function was calculated for the composite group of patients and subgrouped by operative procedure. RESULTS: Lung function appears to improve in the first few months following LVRS in most patients, maximizing at approximately 3 to 6 months and declining thereafter. The short-term incremental improvement following staple procedures is superior to improvements following laser procedures or unilateral surgery: FEV1 increase (mean+/-SD) of 0.39+/-0.03 L for bilateral staple, 0.25+/-0.03 L for unilateral staple, 0.10+/-0.03 L for unilateral laser, and 0.22+/-0.1 L for mixed unilateral staple/laser procedures. However, the long-term rate of decline in FEV1 was greatest for bilateral staple LVRS procedures as well: 0.255+/-0.057 L/yr for bilateral staple, 0.107+/-0.068 L/yr for unilateral staple, 0.074+/-0.034 L/yr for unilateral laser, and 0.209+/-0.12 L/yr for mixed staple laser procedures. There was a general correlation between the magnitude of short-term incremental improvement and the rate of deterioration in FEV1 (r=0.292, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: While bilateral staple LVRS procedures lead to greater short-term improvement in FEV1, the more rapid rate of FEV1 decline in these patients and the general association between greater short-term incremental improvement and higher rates of deterioration raise questions regarding optimal long-term procedures. Further studies will be needed to answer these important questions.

TI  - Identification of the L-menthol binding site in guinea-pig lung membranes.  
AB  - 1. L-Menthol inhibits both neurokinin A and capsaicin-induced bronchoconstriction in the guinea-pig and relaxes pre-constricted guinea-pig isolated bronchi. Structure-activity relationships have been defined for the action of (-)-menthol and related compounds on cold receptors, suggesting an action of L-menthol at a pharmacological receptor. We have performed radioligand binding studies to characterize the binding sites for [3H]-L-menthol in whole cell membranes prepared from guinea-pig lung tissue. 2. In kinetic studies. [3H]-L-menthol was found to bind rapidly and reversibly. Binding of [3H]-L-menthol to lung membranes was found to be time-dependent becoming fully associated to its site within 40 min, and half-maximum association occurred within 8 min (t1/2=8 min). [3H]-L-menthol was fully dissociated from its binding site within 8 min, (t1/2=2 min). 3. Inhibition studies presented a pharmacological profile of the 'L-menthol site'. Capsaicin, capsazepine, D-menthol, eugenol, SCH23390 and camphor were all found to displace [3H]-L-menthol binding. In contrast WS3, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, spiperone, flunarazine, bepridil and nicardipine were without effect. 4. We have identified a L-menthol binding site in the guinea-pig, which may represent a site common to a variety of compounds.

TI  - The epidermal growth factor receptor associates with and recruits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor.  
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases are classified into subfamilies, which are believed to function independently, with heterodimerization occurring only within the same subfamily. In this study, we present evidence suggesting a direct interaction between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFbeta) receptor (PDGFbetaR), members of different receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies. We find that the addition of EGF to COS-7 cells and to human foreskin Hs27 fibroblasts results in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFbetaR and results in the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the PDGFbetaR. In R1hER cells, which overexpress the EGFR, we find ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFbetaR and the constitutive binding of a substantial amount of PI-3 kinase activity to it, mimicking the effect of ligand in untransfected cells. In support of the possibility that this may be a direct interaction, we show that the two receptors can be coimmunoprecipitated from untransfected Hs27 fibroblasts and from COS-7 cells. This association can be reconstituted by introducing the two receptors into 293 EBNA cells. The EGFR/PDGFbetaR association is ligand-independent in all cell lines tested. We also demonstrate that the fraction of PDGFbetaR bound to the EGFR in R1hER cells undergoes an EGF-induced mobility shift on Western blots indicative of phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that direct interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases classified under different subfamilies may be more widespread than previously believed.

TI  - sst2 somatostatin receptor mediates negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling through the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1.  
AB  - We have previously reported in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing sst2 that activation of the sst2 somatostatin receptor inhibits insulin-induced cell proliferation by a mechanism involving stimulation of a tyrosine phosphatase activity. Here we show that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was associated with the insulin receptor (IR) at the basal level. Activation of IR by insulin resulted in a rapid and transient increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, its substrates IRS-1 and Shc, and also of SHP-1. This was then followed by a rapid dephosphorylation of these molecules, which was related to the insulin-induced increase of SHP-1 association to IR and of SHP-1 activity. On the other hand, addition to insulin of the somatostatin analogue, RC160, resulted in a higher and faster increase of SHP-1 association to IR directly correlated with an inhibition of phosphorylation of IR and its substrates, IRS-1 and Shc. RC160 also induced a higher and more sustained increase in SHP-1 activity. Furthermore, RC160 completely suppressed the effect of insulin on SHP-1 phosphorylation. Finally, in CHO cells coexpressing sst2 and a catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1, insulin as well as RC160 could no longer stimulate SHP-1 activity. Overexpression of the SHP-1 mutant prevented the insulin-induced signaling to be terminated by dephosphorylation of IR, suppressed the inhibitory effect of RC160 on insulin-induced IR phosphorylation, and abolished the cell proliferation modulation by insulin and RC160. Our results suggest that SHP-1 plays a role in negatively modulating insulin signaling by association with IR. Furthermore, somatostatin inhibits the insulin-induced mitogenic signal by accelerating and amplifying the effect of SHP-1 on the termination of the insulin signaling pathway.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma in Brazil: report of a national survey (Florianopolis, SC, 1995).  
AB  - In order to investigate epidemiological aspects of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Brazil, basic informations about cases diagnosed from January 1992 to December 1994 were requested to several medical centers of different Brazilian States. A simple questionnaire included age, sex, alcohol abuse (over 80g/day), associated liver cirrhosis, persistent HBV infection (HBsAg), HCV infection (anti-HCV) and serum levels of alpha fetoprotein. 287 cases, over 16 years old, from 19 medical centers of 8 States (Para, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul) were analysed. The results showed: (a) Mean age was 56.3 +/- 14.4 for men and 54.7 +/- 16.8 yr for women and the male/female ratio was 3.4:1. (b) 69.6% were caucasians, 21.8% mullatoes, 4.8% orientals and 3.7% blacks. (c) HBsAg (+) in 77/236 cases (41.6%) without differences between males and females. (d) Anti-HCV (+) in 52/193 cases (26.9%). (e) 7/180 cases were positive both for HBsAg and anti-HCV (3.8%). (f) There was chronic alcoholism in 88/235 cases (37%). (g) HCC was found in cirrhotic livers in 71.2% of 202 cases in which the presence or absence of cirrhosis was reported. (h) Alpha-fetoprotein above 20 ng/ml was found in 124/172 cases (72%) and above 500 ng/ml only in 40 cases (23.2%). These results showed that the HCC in Brazil has an intermediate epidemiological pattern as compared to those from areas of low and high incidence of the tumor. In spite of the high frequency of the association of HCC with the HBV and/or HCV infections, 42% of 180 cases were negative both for HBsAg and anti-HCV, indicating the possible role of other etiological factors. The comparison of data from different States showed some regional differences: higher frequency of associated HBsAg in Para, Bahia, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, higher frequency of associated HCV infection in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and States of the Southern region and low frequency of associated liver cirrhosis in Salvador and Rio de Janeiro (55.5 and 50% respectively). Further investigation will be necessary to study the presence of other possible etiological factors as aflatoxins, suggested by the favourable climatic conditions for food contamination by fungi in the majority Brazilian regions.

Data provided by a large probability sample of older adults in the People's Republic of China reveal that the relationship between financial difficulty and psychological distress is stronger for older adults who receive more economic assistance. However, the results involving anticipated support are in the opposite direction. More specifically, the association between financial problems and psychological distress is lower for older adults who believe that others stand ready to help in the future should the need arise. A detailed theoretical rationale is developed to explain these results.

TI  - Associations of individuals' health-related behavior with their own or their spouses' smoking status.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies indicated that smokers have poor health habits such as high alcohol consumption and imbalanced nutrient intakes. These habits could affect the health-related behavior of smokers' families. METHODS: To investigate the relationship between an individual's health-related behavior (nutrient intakes and participation in cancer screening) and their spouses' smoking status, we analyzed data collected using a self-administered questionnaire during a cohort study. We compared nutrient intakes and cancer screening participation rates between subjects grouped according to their spouses' smoking status, using a multivariate linear regression model to adjust for each subject's age and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: There was an association between husbands' and wives' smoking status (never and current only). Poor micronutrient intakes and cancer screening participation rates were associated with both the subjects' and their spouses' smoking habits. This tendency was most apparent among male smokers and nonsmoking women. However, among nonsmoking men and female smokers, there were no statistically significant differences between groups classified according to their spouses' smoking status. CONCLUSION: Spouses' smoking habits were associated with poor health-related behavior in their partners.

TI  - Intermediate filament cytoskeletal proteins associated with bovine lens native membrane fractions.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the intermediate filament cytoskeletal proteins associated with native membrane fractions isolated from bovine lenses. METHODS: Decapsulated bovine lenses were divided into cortex and nucleus. The lens regions were homogenized and separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions by centrifugation. Sedimenting membrane fractions were isolated from the water-insoluble fraction by discontinuous sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation and the non-sedimenting membrane fractions were isolated from the Kbr high-density water-soluble fractions by flotation, during overnight centrifugation. The intermediate filament peptides of the membrane fractions were examined by Western blot analysis, using monoclonal antibodies to filensin, cytoskeletal protein 49 (CP49) and vimentin. RESULTS: Filensin immunoreactive peptides were found in all membrane fractions of both cortex and nucleus. The parent 115 kDa filensin was found almost exclusively in the urea-soluble protein of cortical membrane fractions, and was the predominant filensin immunoreactive peptide only in the urea-soluble protein of the cortical sedimenting membrane fraction isolated from the 25%/45% sucrose density interface. The predominant filensin immunoreactive peptide of all other samples migrated with a M(r) of 53 kDa. CP49 immunoreactive peptides were found almost exclusively in the urea-soluble protein of all membrane fractions from both the cortex and nucleus. The cortical non-sedimenting membrane fraction and the nuclear membrane fraction of the 25%/45% sucrose density interface were notably deficient in CP49. Vimentin immunoreactive peptides were found in both urea-soluble and urea-insoluble proteins of membrane fractions from the cortex only. Vimentin was particularly enriched in the cortical non-sedimenting membrane fraction. The urea-insoluble filensin immunoreactive peptides were only partially removed by alkali extraction, indicating a very avid association with the membrane. Two dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the urea-soluble protein of the major cortical membrane fraction contained two different filensin-derived 53 kDa fragments. CONCLUSIONS: The non-sedimenting membrane fraction, which may reflect a distinct domain of the lens plasma membrane, possesses a membrane-associated cytoskeletal composition different from that of the major sedimenting membrane fractions.

TI  - c-Src is required for stimulation of gelsolin-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.  
AB  - We have shown that osteopontin binding to integrin alphav beta3 in osteoclasts stimulates gelsolin-associated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-hydroxyl kinase (PI 3-kinase), leading to increased levels of gelsolin-bound PtdIns 3,4-P2, PtdIns 4,5-P2, and PtdIns 3, 4,5-P3, uncapping of barbed end actin, and actin filament formation. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by wortmannin blocks osteopontin stimulation of actin filament formation, suggesting that activation of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase is an important pathway in cytoskeletal regulation. To study the mechanism of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase activation, we analyzed anti-gelsolin immunoprecipitates for the association of protein kinases. We demonstrated that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with gelsolin, and that osteopontin stimulates its activity. Elimination of osteopontin-stimulated Src activity associated with gelsolin through antisense oligodeoxynucleotides blocked the stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity associated with gelsolin and the gelsolin-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization induced by osteopontin, including increased F-actin levels. In addition, treatment of osteoclasts with antisense oligonucleotides to Src reduced bone resorption. Our results demonstrate that osteopontin stimulates gelsolin-associated Src, leading to increased gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase activity and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels, which facilitate actin filament formation, osteoclast motility, and bone resorption.

AB  - Green tea extract and its polyphenolic components have been found to possess anticarcinogenic, antimutagenic, antihypertensive and antihepatotoxic effects, and several mechanisms have been proposed for these effects. In this study, the effects of five tea polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-) epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( -) epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (C), were examined on the viability of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in vitro and a possible relationship with tyrosine phosphorylation was determined. Proteins extracted from the cells treated with the tea polyphenols were separated by SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and the extent of phosphorylation determined. EGC (100 microM) caused a significant decrease in cell viability to 4.1 +/- 0.2% of the control value, and this correlated with a stimulation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. EGCG (100 microM) also caused a slight decrease in cell viability (approximately 70% of the control value) but this and the other polyphenols, which had no effect on cell viability likewise, had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylations of 42 and 45 kDa proteins were also observed for EGC. Further evaluation of the effect of EGC showed that the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis in cells, decreased significantly as well. A significant correlation has therefore been observed between a cellular event, namely, a reduction in the viability of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and an association with a tyrosine phosphorylation of 42 and 45 kDa proteins by the polyphenol EGC.

TI  - Serum hormone levels in relation to reproductive and lifestyle factors in postmenopausal women (United States).  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endogenous sex hormones are thought to be involved in breast and endometrial cancers, but few studies have evaluated the relationships between hormones and risk factors for these diseases. METHODS: We related serum hormone and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels to reproductive and lifestyle risk factors in a cross-sectional study of 125 postmenopausal women in five geographic regions of the United States. RESULTS: The estrogens were associated positively, while SHBG was associated negatively with body mass index (wt/ht2). Estrone, (E1), estrone sulfate, and bioavailable estradiol (BioE2) were inversely associated with height. Androstenedione was positively associated with age at menopause, while androstenedione, E1, estradiol, and BioE2 were inversely associated with age at menarche. Weekly alcohol drinkers had higher hormone levels, and lower SHBG levels than those who abstained. Androstenedione and E1 decreased with increasing levels of nonrecreational activity. CONCLUSIONS: Several of these findings support the hypothesis that breast and endometrial cancer risk factors are mediated, in part, through increased endogenous hormone levels. The androstenedione findings are of interest in light of studies relating androstenedione to endometrial and possibly breast cancer.  An association of age at menarche with E2, independent of androstenedione, may reflect increased aromatase activity in women with earlier menarche.

TI  - An Italian epidemiological multicentre study of nocturnal enuresis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of enuresis in schoolchildren in Italy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Italian Club of Nocturnal Enuresis promoted a prevalence study of nocturnal enuresis using a self-administered questionnaire in seven cities in Northern, Central and Southern Italy.  The association between enuresis and potential risk factors, e.g. a family history of enuresis, stress, socio-economic status and abnormal diurnal voiding habits, was investigated. The perceived impact on the child and on the family was also evaluated. A random-cluster sampling scheme was used to obtain a sample of primary and secondary schoolchildren from each city. One primary school and one secondary school for each socio-economic level was sampled in each city, giving a total of 42 schools surveyed; 9086 children were covered by the survey. In a cluster sampling method, the variance of prevalence is divided into two components, binomial and extra-binomial variability. Both the DSM III and DSM IV definitions of enuresis were used because at present, there is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were received from 7012 children, an overall response rate of 77.2%. Those aged 6-14 years were analysed, restricting the sample to 6892 children. There were 250 enuretic children using the DSM III definition of enuresis and 112 using the DSM IV definition. The overall prevalence was 3.88% and showed a decreasing trend with increasing age. Bedwetting was more frequent in boys than in girls. The prevalence of enuresis was higher when the child was from a family of low socio-economic status despite the child's age group. The logistic analysis showed that familiality, stress, birthweight, age of attaining diurnal continence, soiling and, for girls, menstruation, were statistically significant variables and thus contributed to predicting the probability of bedwetting, confirming the findings of previous studies. There was a large difference in prevalence using the two DSM definitions; a high percentage of DSM III enuretic children had more than two wet nights per week. CONCLUSION: It is important that a consensus about the 'working definitions' of enuresis is reached to avoid bias in the recruitment step, to carry out comparable epidemiological studies and to obtain adequate therapeutic responses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since the Second World War coincides with profound changes of the dietary pattern. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible pathogenic role of some characteristic 'modern life' dietary factors in IBD. DESIGN: Case-control, studying risk factors in recently diagnosed cases, 290 with Crohn's disease and 398 with ulcerative colitis, compared with 616 population controls. Smoking, age, gender and education were taken into account by using logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Hospital cases and population controls. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression-derived odds ratios. RESULTS: A positive association with cola drinks [OR: 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1)], chewing gum [OR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5)] and a negative association with citrus fruit consumption [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.7)] and the development of Crohn's disease were found. Consumption of cola drinks [OR: 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)] and chocolate consumption [OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)] were positively associated with developing ulcerative colitis. There was a negative association between the intake of citrus fruits [OR: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.8)] and 'having a stuffed pet' for a period longer than 5 years [OR: 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9)] and developing the disorder. No association with the frequency of tooth brushing and developing IBD was found. CONCLUSION: All the nutritional items mentioned may be true risk factors or they just might be the expression of a modern life-style also involving other risk factors for the development of IBD which at the present are still unknown.

AB  - Protein kinase N (PKN) is a fatty acid- and Rho-activated serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of cell motility by association with cytoskeletal components such as neurofilament and alpha-actinin. We determined the chromosomal location of the human PKN gene PRKCL1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and by radiation hybrid mapping. The corresponding mouse gene Prkcl1 was mapped by segregation analysis. We found by FISH that PRKCL1 is localized to chromosome 19p12-p13.1 and, more precisely, by radiation hybrid mapping, about 11 cR from EST WI-6344 in subband 19p12. Prkcl1 maps to mouse chromosome 8 between D8Mit6 and junb. This region of mouse Chr 8 shows a scrambled syntenic conservation to human chromosomes 4q, 8p, and 19p. As the mouse mutation myodystrophy myd has been mapped to the same region, Prkcl1 is a candidate gene for myd.

TI  - [Selective screening of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli depending on hemolysis on Beutin's washed sheep blood agar plates]  
AB  - Recently, Beutin et al have studied hemolysin production in a large number of serologically diverse verotoxin (VT) producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) strains and found a close association between hemolysin production and VT production. This study was to examine whether hemolysin production on sheep blood agar can be used as an epidemiological marker for microbiological screening of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). In comparison of hemolysis on washed blood agar plates prepared in our laboratory and commercially available blood agar, all VT producing strains exhibited a typical hemolytic phenotype on the former, on the other hand, VT non-producers were less hemolytic on the former than the latter. On the washed blood agar, 11 VT1 producing strains belonging to 4 different serotypes, 1 strain of VT2 producer, 5 VT1&2 producers belonging to 2 different serotypes, all the 17 strains of VTEC were positive for hemolysis. The 85 VT non-producing strains belonging to 18 different serotypes isolated from faecal specimens from patients with diarrhea were tested, 10 strains (12%) belonging to 4 different serotypes (O6, 18, 26, UT: untypable) produced hemolysin. Two-hundred four (10%) of the 2,036 strains isolated from faecal specimens from 507 healthy persons exhibited typical hemolysis. As a result of identification of these 204 hemolytic strains, 148 strains of E. coli 13 strains of Citrobacter and 10 strains of other enterobacteria, and 13 strains of Pseudomonas, 12 strains of Aeromonas, 5 strains of Proteus and 3 strains of Vibrio were detected. 148 hemolytic strains of E. coli were carried out O-serotyping with commercially available pathogenic E. coli antisera, 57 strains (39%) were classified into 11 different serotypes, but 91 strains were not typable. Most frequent serotype was O18 (24 strains), next O6 (18 strains), and other 8 different serotypes (O25, 26, 28ac, 29, 55, 146, 152, 159) were less than 2 strain respectively.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To establish the source of a community outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium definitive type 124. DESIGN: Two stage case-control study. SETTING: Three districts in south east Wales. SUBJECTS: Cases of salmonella food poisoning and community controls. MAIN RESULTS: An initial case-control study identified an association between illness and eating ham (odds ratio 4.50, 95% confidence intervals 1.10, 21.8) and also found a possible association between illness and food bought from delicatessen stores (odds ratio 5.03, 95% confidence intervals 1.01, 32.3). However, only after a second stage case-control study was a single common ham producer identified as the source (odds ratio 25.0, 95% confidence intervals 2.33, 1155). CONCLUSION: Sequential case-control studies are an important and underused tool in the investigation of community outbreaks.

TI  - The hemochromatosis 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations: prevalence in non-Caucasian populations.  
AB  - Hemochromatosis, the inherited disorder of iron metabolism, leads, if untreated, to progressive iron overload and premature death. The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, recently has been identified, and characterization of this gene has shown that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions-cDNA nucleotides 845 G-->A (C282Y) and 187 C-->G (H63D). Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians, affecting >=1/300 individuals of northern European origin, it has not been recognized in other populations. The present study used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations in HLA-typed samples from non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. Results showed that the 845 G-->A mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and, furthermore, it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that 845 G-->A may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. 187 C-->G was present at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the two populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, 187 C-->G was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, 187 C-->G was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing this mutation to be widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted 845 G-->A mutation.

TI  - The role of polar interactions in the molecular recognition of CD40L with its receptor CD40.  
AB  - CD40 Ligand (CD40L) is transiently expressed on the surface of T-cells and binds to CD40, which is expressed on the surface of B-cells. This binding event leads to the differentiation, proliferation, and isotype switching of the B-cells. The physiological importance of CD40L has been demonstrated by the fact that expression of defective CD40L protein causes an immunodeficiency state characterized by high IgM and low IgG serum levels, indicating faulty T-cell dependent B-cell activation. To understand the structural basis for CD40L/CD40 association, we have used a combination of molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The structure of the extracellular region of CD40L was determined by protein crystallography, while the CD40 receptor was built using homology modeling based upon a novel alignment of the TNF receptor superfamily, and using the X-ray structure of the TNF receptor as a template. The model shows that the interface of the complex is composed of charged residues, with CD40L presenting basic side chains (K143, R203, R207), and CD40 presenting acidic side chains (D84, E114, E117). These residues were studied experimentally through site-directed mutagenesis, and also theoretically using electrostatic calculations with the program Delphi. The mutagenesis data explored the role of the charged residues in both CD40L and CD40 by switching to Ala (K143A, R203A, R207A of CD40L, and E74A, D84A, E114A, E117A of CD40), charge reversal (K143E, R203E, R207E of CD40L, and D84R, E114R, E117R of CD40), mutation to a polar residue (K143N, R207N, R207Q of CD40L, and D84N, E117N of CD40), and for the basic side chains in CD40L, isosteric substitution to a hydrophobic side chain (R203M, R207M). All the charge-reversal mutants and the majority of the Met and Ala substitutions led to loss of binding, suggesting that charged interactions stabilize the complex. This was supported by the Delphi calculations which confirmed that the CD40/CD40L residue pairs E74-R203, D84-R207, and E117-R207 had a net stabilizing effect on the complex. However, the substitution of hydrophilic side chains at several of the positions was tolerated, which suggests that although charged interactions stabilize the complex, charge per se is not crucial at all positions. Finally, we compared the electrostatic surface of TNF/TNFR with CD40L/CD40 and have identified a set of polar interactions surrounded by a wall of hydrophobic residues that appear to be similar but inverted between the two complexes.

TI  -  Association between restriction fragment length polymorphism of the L-myc gene and susceptibility to gastric cancer.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: L-myc polymorphism has been documented to be a representative genetic trait which is related an individual's susceptibility to several cancers. However, there have been no reports concerning any significant association between susceptibility to gastric cancer and L-myc polymorphism. METHODS: The distribution of L-myc polymorphism in 61 patients with gastric cancer was determined by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism and compared with that of 107 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the distribution of both genotypes (P = 0.024) and allele frequencies (P = 0.026) between the two groups. The relative risk of gastric cancer for genotypes with the shorter (S) allele was 3.09 compared with the longer (L) allele homozygote. No significant correlation with clinicopathological features of the cancers except for prognosis was found. The patients with SS genotypes had a worse prognosis than those with LL or LS genotypes (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: L-myc polymorphism may be significant in an individual's susceptibility to gastric cancer in Japan, and may be a useful marker for identifying patients at high risk of developing gastric cancer.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in cardiovascular risk from childhood to young adulthood in offspring of parents with coronary artery disease: the Bogalusa Heart Study [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: Although the association between parental coronary artery disease (CAD) and its risk factors in the offspring is known, the timing and the course of development of risk factors from childhood to adulthood in the offspring is not known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between parental CAD and longitudinal changes in risk factor profile from childhood to young adulthood in offspring. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Bogalusa, La, a semirural, biracial community. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with clinically verified parental history of CAD (n=271) vs those without such a history (n = 1253) Mean age at first CAD event was 50 years for fathers and 52 years for mothers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, subscapular skinfolds, blood pressure, and triglyceride, cholesterol (total, very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL-C], low-density lipoprotein [LDL-C], and high-density lipoprotein [HDL-C] cholesterols), glucose, and insulin levels. RESULTS: The offspring of parents with CAD were consistently overweight beginning in childhood. Their levels of total serum cholesterol, LDL-C, plasma glucose, and insulin became significantly higher at older ages, because of a higher rate of increase in these risk factors over time. In adulthood, the offspring with a positive parental history had a higher prevalence of obesity (body mass index >85th percentile in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I, 35% vs 26%, P=.01), elevated total cholesterol (>6.2 mmol/L [240 mg/dL], 8.4% vs 4.8%, P=.05) and LDL-C levels (>4.1 mmol/L [160 mg/dL], 12.4% vs 4.7%, P=.05), and hyperglycemia (glucose, >6.6 mmol/L, 2.7% vs 0.4%, P<.001), as well as a higher coexistence of these conditions (P=.01). Further, the prevalence of dyslipidemia, either involving only LDL-C or LDL-C in combination with HDL-C or triglycerides or both, was significantly higher in the adult offspring with parental CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Offspring of parents with early CAD were overweight beginning in childhood and developed an adverse cardiovascular risk factor profile at an increased rate. These observations have important implications for prevention and intervention.

TI  - The prospective value of the IPCS/EC/EAPCCT poisoning severity score in cases of poisoning.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The poisoning severity score is a four-point severity-classification scale, developed by the International Programme on Chemical Safety, the Commission of the European Union, and the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (IPCS/EC/EAPCCT), for the retrospective assessment of cases of poisoning reported to poisons information centers. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to test the validity of using the poisoning severity score obtained at initial referral to assess clinical severity and the likelihood of subsequent deterioration, to select cases for follow-up, and also to determine the need for referral to a clinical toxicologist. METHODS: The poisoning severity score was determined at the time of initial inquiry. Follow-up was then undertaken until either the patient was discharged from medical attention or died. A second poisoning severity score was then calculated taking note of the most severe features present after the initial inquiry. RESULTS: Of 718 consecutive telephone inquiries, 397 were given an initial poisoning severity score of 0 (no signs and symptoms), 225 a score of 1 (mild symptoms), 71 a score of 2 (moderate symptoms), and 25 a score of 3 (severe symptoms). Follow-up data are available only in 638 cases because the patient or referring doctor could not be traced in 80 instances. Of the 638 cases, 41 deteriorated; 31 of these were graded initially as poisoning severity score 0, four as 1, and six as 2. Five patients died (two with an initial score of 2 and three with an initial score of 3). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is useful to score telephone inquiries to a poisons information service at initial referral with the poisoning severity score. First, the poisoning severity score is helpful in assessing accurately the clinical severity and the likelihood of further deterioration. Second, the poisoning severity score is useful in determining the need for referral of the inquiry to a clinical toxicologist, thus ensuring that more serious and complicated cases of poisoning receive expert medical advice on management. Third, the poisoning severity score is helpful in selecting those cases which warrant follow-up for medical and epidemiological reasons.

TI  - Randomised investigation of effects of pentoxifylline on left-ventricular performance in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is accumulating evidence that inflammatory cytokines have an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are high in heart failure and have been correlated with the severity of symptoms. Pentoxifylline suppresses the production of TNF-alpha. This study aimed to assess the effects of pentoxifylline on left-ventricular function and functional class in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: We undertook a single-centre, prospective, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, in which 28 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were assigned pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily or matching placebo. Clinical, echocardiographic, and radionuclide assessments were done at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Primary endpoints were New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and left-ventricular function. FINDINGS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Four patients died during the study period, all in the placebo group. After 6 months of treatment, the proportion of patients in NYHA functional class I or II was higher in the pentoxifylline group than in the placebo group (14/14 vs 10/14; p=0.01), and ejection fraction was higher in the pentoxifylline group than in the placebo group (mean 38.7% [SD 15.0] vs 26.8% [11.0], p=0.04). At 6 months, TNF-alpha plasma concentrations were significantly lower in the pentoxifylline-treated group than in the placebo group (2.1 [1.0] vs 6.5 [5.0] pg/mL, p=0.001). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that pentoxifylline improves symptoms and left-ventricular systolic function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These results must be confirmed in larger-scale trials.

TI  - Neuropsychological performance and plasma cortisol, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin in patients with major depression.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to search for the existence of, and define, a possible relationship between performance in neuropsychological tests and baseline concentrations of plasma cortisol, vasopressin and oxytocin in medication-free patients with a major depressive episode. METHODS: Measures of depression and anxiety were obtained and a neuropsychological battery was presented. Blood for neuropeptide analysis was drawn by venepuncture at 8.00, 16.00 and 23.00 h. RESULTS: The melancholic patients performed less well on the neuropsychological battery than did the non-melancholic patients, but these differences could be accounted for by the severity of the illness. Global intellectual functioning was negatively correlated with mean baseline plasma concentrations of cortisol. Patients with high mean plasma vasopressin concentrations remembered more auditory presented words in the delayed recall test and produced more intrusions in the visual word learning list than did patients with low or normal mean plasma vasopressin concentrations.  No association was found between neuropsychological performance and plasma concentrations of oxytocin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that elevated baseline plasma cortisol concentrations are related to cognitive impairment in depressed patients and the hypothesis that the neuropeptide vasopressin independently enhances memory, directly or indirectly through increasing arousal and attention.

AB  - Three germline p53 polymorphisms, a 16 bp duplication in intron 3, a Bst UI RFLP in exon 4 and Msp I RFLP in intron 6 have previously been tested for a association with Swedish breast cancer patients. The rare Bst UI allele was found to be associated with breast cancer in the Swedish patients (OR 1.47, 95% CI, 1.08-2.00). In our hospital-based case-control study leukocyte DNA of 107 breast cancer patients and 305 control women was analyzed. Individuals heterozygous at all 3 polymorphic sites (27/107) were over-represented in the breast cancer group with an age-adjusted OR of 2.01 (95% CI, 1.02-3.94). Haplotype analysis identified the 16 bp A2 allele (with 16 bp duplication) and Msp I A1 allele (loss of Msp I restriction site) as risk alleles. The results of this study suggest that the rare alleles 16 bp A 2 and Msp I A1 of the p53 locus may modify the risk of breast cancer in German women.

TI  - Clinical features of acute allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts in children.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peanut (PN) and tree nut (TN) allergies are potentially life-threatening, rarely outgrown, and appear to be increasing in prevalence. However, there is relatively little reported about the clinical features of acute reactions to these foods and their potential association. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of acute reactions during initial and subsequent accidental ingestions of PN and TN among children with a history of at least one acute allergic reaction to these foods. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey, examination, and serologic testing for specific IgE antibody of patients with convincing histories of acute reactions (at least one organ system involved within 60 minutes of ingestion) to PN or TN. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (63% males; median age, 8 years at time of study) had acute reactions; 68 had reactions only to PN, 20 only to TN, and 34 to both PN and TN. Of those reacting to TN, 34 had reactions to one, 12 to two, and 8 to three or more different TN, the most common being walnut, almond, and pecan. Initial reactions usually occurred at home (median age, 24 months for PN and 62 months for TN) and were considered to result from a first exposure in 72% of cases. Eighty-nine percent of the reactions involved the skin (urticaria, angioedema), 52% the respiratory tract (wheezing, throat tightness, repetitive coughing, dyspnea), and 32% the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea). Two organ systems were affected in 31% of initial reactions, and all three in 21% of reactions. Thirty-eight of 190 first reactions to PN or TN were treated with epinephrine. Accidental ingestions occurred in 55% of PN-allergic children (average of two accidents per patient with an accidental ingestion) and in 30% of TN-allergic children over a median period of 5.5 years. On average, symptoms after accidental exposure were generally similar to those at initial exposure. Accidents occurred commonly in school but also at home and in restaurants. Modes of accidental ingestion included sharing food, hidden ingredients, cross-contamination, and school craft projects using peanut butter. Eighty-three percent of the children were breastfed, with >90% of the mothers ingesting PN and at least one TN during lactation. Among patients reporting no history of exposure (>60% of patients for each TN), IgE antibodies were found to a particular TN in 50% to 82% of patients and to PN in 100% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Acute allergic reactions to PN occur early in life. PN and TN allergic reactions coexist in one third of PN-allergic patients, frequently occur on first known exposure, and may be life-threatening, requiring emergency treatment. Accidental ingestions are common, occur frequently outside of the home, and often require emergency treatment. Consequently, early diagnosis followed by education on avoidance and treatment measures (including self-administered epinephrine) is imperative.

TI  - Cain, a novel physiologic protein inhibitor of calcineurin.  
AB  - Calcineurin is a widely distributed protein phosphatase regulated by calcium and calmodulin. It mediates the immunosuppressive actions of drugs such as cyclosporin and FK506, and has been implicated in a number of calcium-sensitive pathways in the nervous system, including regulation of neurotransmitter release and modulation of long-term changes in synaptic plasticity. Calcineurin associates physiologically with other proteins, including calmodulin, FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein), the ryanodine receptor, and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. We now report the identification, molecular cloning, and functional characterization of a novel protein, cain (calcineurin inhibitor), that interacts with and inhibits calcineurin. The full-length cain cDNA predicts a 240-kDa protein with no significant homology to any known protein. Cain associates with calcineurin both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a non-competitive inhibition of calcineurin activity. The putative calcineurin-binding domain of cain, a 38-amino acid region defined by mutational analysis, is highly basic. Like calcineurin, cain has a prominent neuronal expression and a wide tissue distribution. Cain's expression pattern in the brain closely resembles that of calcineurin, indicating a physiologic association between the two proteins.

AB  - The aim of this study, conducted in 1994, was to examine the association between approximal caries and sugar consumption in teenagers residing in three fluoride-deficient areas in Iceland while controlling for a number of behavioral, residential and microbiological factors. One hundred and fifty subjects (mean age 14 years) selected from the Icelandic Nutritional Survey (INS) were examined radiographically and they completed questionnaires about sugar consumption frequency. Total grams of sugar intake were obtained from the INS for each subject. Caries experience on approximal surfaces, diagnosed from radiographs, was used as the dependent variable in the analyses. Altogether 45.2% of subjects were caries free on approximal surfaces. The overall sample was found to have a mean DFS on approximal surfaces of 2.73 (s=4.36) per subject. Average daily total sugar intake was 170 g per subject and the mean number of sugar-eating occasions between meals was 5.32 (s=6.29) per subject. The regression model indicated that the frequency of between-meal sugar consumption was associated with approximal caries, with frequency of candy consumption being the most important of the sugar variables. In multivariate analysis, no relationship was found between dental caries and total daily intake of sugar, although a significant relationship between total sugar consumption and presence of caries was seen in bivariate analysis. Between-meal consumption of sugar remains a risk factor for the occurrence of dental caries, especially in populations with moderate-to-high levels of dental caries experience.

Varied malformations due to hydantoin intake during pregnancy include digit and nail hypoplasia, growth retardation, typical facial appearance, rib anomalies, abnormal palmar creases, hirsutism, and low hairlines. Ambiguous genitalia is rarely associated with this syndrome. We present two siblings, aged three years and three months, with fetal hydantoin syndrome (FHS). Both were born to an epileptic mother who was given diphenylhydantoin (DPH) and phenobarbital throughout her pregnancies. The patients showed many characteristics of FHS, and ambiguous genitalia. Clinical and laboratory examinations revealed that both have normal female internal genital organs and female karyotypes.

TI  - Association between angiotensin II receptor gene polymorphism and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) activity in patients with sarcoidosis [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE) is considered to reflect disease activity in sarcoidosis. SACE activity is increased in many patients with active sarcoid lesions. The mechanism for the increased SACE activity in this disease has not been clarified. ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism has been reported to have an association with SACE levels in sarcoidosis, but no evidence of an association between angiotensin II receptor gene polymorphism and SACE in this disease has been found. A study of the association of angiotensin II receptor gene polymorphisms with sarcoidosis was therefore undertaken. METHODS: ACE (I/D), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2) gene polymorphisms were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SACE levels were measured in three groups of patients: those with sarcoidosis or tuberculosis and normal controls. RESULTS: There was no difference in allele frequency of AGTR1 and AGTR2 polymorphism among the three groups. Neither AGTR1 nor AGTR2 polymorphisms were associated with sarcoidosis. SACE activity was higher in patients with sarcoidosis with the AGTR1 A/C genotype than in others. However, this tendency was not detected in patients with tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: The AGTR1 allele C is associated with high activity of SACE in patients with sarcoidosis. It is another predisposing factor for high levels of SACE in patients with sarcoidosis and is considered to be an independent factor from the ACE D allele for high levels of SACE in sarcoidosis. This fact could be one of the explanations for the increased SACE activity in sarcoidosis.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric neoplasia: correlations with histological gastritis and tumor histology.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several authors have reported an association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and gastric carcinoma, but the data are conflicting. Atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia (IM) have also been linked to gastric carcinoma, especially the intestinal tumor type. We investigated the relationship between H. pylori infection, gastric neoplasms, and histological gastritis. METHODS: A total of 105 patients with gastric carcinoma, 36 patients with gastric adenoma, and 105 age- and sex-matched control subjects were examined for H. pylori infection and histological gastritis. H. pylori status was evaluated by Giemsa staining and IgG serology. Mucosal inflammation, atrophy, and IM were evaluated in biopsy specimens from antrum and corpus. RESULTS: H. pylori seroprevalence was higher in patients with gastric carcinoma (98 of 105, 93%) and adenoma (34 of 36, 94%) than in control subjects (82 of 105, 71%, p < 0.05). H. pylori was more prevalent in patients with noncardia (OR, 5.67; 95% CI, 2.25-14.44) than cardia (OR, 5.20; 95% CI, 0.65-41.68) tumors. Histologic types and tumor stage (early; OR, 6.60; 95% CI, 2.23-19.69, advanced; OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.21-15.03) showed no difference in H. pylori prevalence. Atrophy and IM scores were higher in patients with the intestinal- but not diffuse-type of carcinoma and adenoma than in H. pylori-positive control subjects. Smoking was associated with gastric carcinoma (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.58-5.93) but not alcohol or coffee use, blood group A, or a family history of gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a strong association between H. pylori and gastric carcinoma and adenoma. The intestinal-type gastric carcinoma is associated with atrophic gastritis and IM.

TI  - Does light-to-moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy increase the risk for renal anomalies among offspring?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between light-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and congenital renal anomalies. METHODS: Data from the population-based Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control Study were used to examine the association between selected renal anomalies and self-reported maternal alcohol consumption during the period from 1 month before through 3 months after conception. Case infants were ascertained by a population-based birth defects registry with active case ascertainment; the case group consisted of 158 infants, born during 1968 through 1980 to metropolitan Atlanta residents, in whom these renal anomalies had been diagnosed. Two control groups were used. One had 3029 infants without birth defects, and the other had 4633 infants with birth defects exclusive of the urinary tract who were born during the same period. RESULTS: Overall, there was a moderate association between renal anomalies and moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.3). When the renal anomalies were subclassified, moderate prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated only with renal agenesis or hypoplasia (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.1), and within this group only infants with bilateral defects and other major anomalies in addition to renal agenesis or hypoplasia had significantly elevated risks. There were no significant associations between reported light consumption and any category of the selected renal anomalies. No conclusions could be reached for reported heavy consumption because of sparse data. Adjustments for potential confounding factors did not alter these results. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase a woman's risk of giving birth to a child with renal agenesis or hypoplasia.

TI  - Lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis: effective and durable therapy in a high-risk group.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to review our experience with lung transplantation in patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Eight-two patients with cystic fibrosis have undergone bilateral lung transplantation (n=76) or bilateral lower lobe transplantation (n=6) since October 1990. RESULTS: Actuarial survival for the entire cohort is 79% at 1 year and 57% at 5 years. The development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the leading cause of death after the first year. Freedom from bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is 84% at 1 year and 51% at 3 years. Pulmonary function tests improve dramatically in recipients. There was no association between death within 1 year and recipient age, weight, graft ischemic time, cytomegalovirus seronegativity, or the presence of pan-resistant organisms. Similarly, there was no association between the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome within 2 years and ischemic time, number of rejection episodes, cytomegalovirus seronegativity, or the presence of panresistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their poor nutritional status and the presence of multiply resistant organisms, patients with cystic fibrosis can undergo bilateral lung transplantation with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

TI  - ECG processing techniques based on neural networks and bidirectional associative memories.  
AB  - Two ECG processing techniques are described for the classification of QRSs, PVCs and normal and ischaemic beats. The techniques use neural network (NN) technology in two ways. The first technique, uses nonlinear ECG mapping preprocessing and subsequently for classification uses a shrinking algorithm based on NNs. This technique is applied to the QRS/PVC problem with good result. The second technique is based on the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) NN and is used to distinguish normal from ischaemic beats. In this technique the ECG beat is treated as a digitized image which is then transformed into a bipolar vector suitable for input in the BAM. The results show that this method, if properly calibrated, can result in a fast and reliable ischaemic beat detection algorithm.

TI  - Apoptosis in Daudi human B cells in response to benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol.  
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lymphocyte toxicity. The present study shows that, consistent with its effects on Ca2+ homeostasis, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) induces apoptosis in Daudi cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidal transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis at 18 h revealed a significant increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to BaP (75%), BaP-7, 8-dihydrodiol (110%), and BaP-7,8-9,10-diol epoxide (BPDE) (215%) over DMSO vehicle control cultures. By 36 h, the trend toward increasing numbers of apoptotic cells continued with the parent compound producing a 125% increase over control values and the 7, 8-dihydrodiol and BPDE metabolites producing 195% and 370% increases over controls, respectively. DNA fragmentation assays demonstrated the presence of internucleosomal cleavage products consistent with the increasing numbers of TUNEL-positive cells responding to PAHs at 18 and 36 h. Analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein in BaP- and BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol-treated cells strongly suggested the involvement of cysteine proteases by the appearance of an 85-kD fragment derived from hydrolytic cleavage of PARP, a phenomenon that has been associated with apoptosis in many systems. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that both BaP and its 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolite affected a pathway involving Bcl-2 and Bax cytosolic proteins. Daudi cells undergoing apoptosis at 36 h in response to 10 &mgr;M BaP, the parent compound, expressed moderately reduced amounts of Bcl-2 (78% of vehicle controls). At the same time point, the 7,8-dihydrodiol and BDPE metabolites at 3 &mgr;M resulted in Bcl-2 protein expression that was 52% of that seen in vehicle controls. Parallel samples analyzed for expression of Bax protein displayed a 130% increase over vehicle control in Bax expression in response to the parent compound, while the 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolite produced a 257% increase in Bax. Furthermore, the effects on increased Bax expression were observed as early as 3 h after PAH exposure. The apoptotic response to PAHs in Daudi cells was sensitive to 4-h pretreatment with 0.3 &mgr;M alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450. In TUNEL assays of cells exposed to PAHs following pretreatment with ANF, at 18 h there was a significant reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to ANF compared to cells that were not pretreated with the compound. The effect of the parent compound at 18 h was completely blocked with ANF pretreatment, while ANF exerted a relatively weaker, but significant, effect on BaP-7, 8-dihydrodiol-induced apoptosis. With regard to modulation of expression of apoptosis-related proteins, Bax expression was restored to that observed in vehicle-control cultures at all time points tested (3, 18, and 36 h). Bcl-2 expression was most responsive to ANF at later time points following PAH exposure (18 and 36 h); however, Bcl-2 appeared to be more sensitive to the effects of ANF alone. Taken together, these data suggest that modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, perhaps secondary to altered Ca2+ homeostasis, plays an important role in human B cell apoptosis induced by BaP.

TI  - Loop III region of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain mediates binding to PDGF receptors and heparin.  
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain was conducted to determine the importance of cationic amino acid residues (Arg160-Lys161-Lys162; RKK) located within the loop III region in mediating the biological and cell-association properties of the molecule. Binding to both PDGF alpha-and beta-receptors was inhibited by the conversion of all three cationic residues into anionic glutamates (RKK-->EEE), whereas an RKK-->SSS mutant also exhibited a modest loss in affinity for beta-receptors. Replacements with serine at either Arg160 (RKK-->SKK) or at all three positions (RKK-->SSS) had little effect on binding to alpha-receptors. Replacements with either glutamic or serine residues at any of the three positions also resulted in significant inhibition of heparin-binding activity. Furthermore, the RKK-->EEE mutant exhibited decreased association with the cell surface and accumulated in the culture medium as 29-32 kDa forms. Stable transfection of U87 astrocytoma cells with RKK-->EEE mutants of either the A-chain or the B-chain inhibited malignant growth in athymic nude mice. Despite altered receptor-binding activities, each of the loop III mutants retained full mitogenic activity when applied to cultured Swiss 3T3 cells. CD spectrophotometric analysis of the RKK-->EEE mutant revealed a secondary structure indistinguishable from the wild type, with a high degree of beta-sheet structure and random coil content (50% and 43% respectively). These findings indicate an important role of the Arg160-Lys161-Lys162 sequence in mediating the biological and cell-associative activities of the PDGF-BB homodimer, and reveal that the mitogenic activity of PDGF-BB is insufficient to mediate its full oncogenic properties.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and upper gastrointestinal bleed in heart valve surgery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate objectively the incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients following heart valve replacement surgery. Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori, its association with gastritis, peptic ulceration and upper GI bleed have been extensively studied. Anticoagulation of patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses is a prerequisite for the prevention of valve thrombosis and thrombo-embolic events. However anticoagulation can have its complications, notably that of upper GI bleeding. METHODS: Patients were assessed in routine postoperative outpatient clinics following cardiac valve replacement surgery. This assessment comprised initially of a questionnaire reflecting the symptomatology of upper GI bleeding and its subsequent management. With informed consent, a small sample of blood was obtained by stilette. The Helicobacter pylori status was assessed by measuring the presence of antibodies (immunoglobins) to Helicobacter pylori in a commercially available test kit, the Rapid Helisal Test. In this preliminary study 150 consecutive patients were scrutinised and their responses to the questionnaire were collected and compared with the Helisal test. RESULTS: From the 150 patients studied, 37 patients were found to be positive to the Helisal test for Helicobacter pylori infection, representing 24.6% of all the cohorts. Of these 37 patients, eight gave a positive history of upper GI bleed; five requiring hospital admission with three requiring urgent upper GI endoscopy. Although these eight patients represent only 4.4% of the total group, it is significant to note that this represents 21.6% of those patients found to be Helicobacter pylori positive. There were no GI complications in any of those tested negative. There was an increasing incidence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the older age group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori infection is a common infection with serious consequences in heart valve surgery. For those requiring anticoagulation, the incidence of serious consequential upper GI bleed is significantly higher in the presence of this infection. Preoperative or immediate postoperative eradication of the organism is mandatory in those patients requiring indefinite anticoagulation.

TI  - D2 receptors binding potential is not affected by Taq1 polymorphism at the D2 receptor gene.  
AB  - Alcoholism and substance abuse have been associated with a polymorphism in a noncoding region of the D2 receptor gene (the A1 allele of the Taq1 'A' system) in several, but not all studies. In addition, the presence of the A1 allele has been associated with lower density of D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus in one postmortem study. If the Taq1 'A1' allele is in linkage disequilibrium with a mutation that decreases the expression of the D2 receptor gene, it is conceivable that subjects with the A1 allele might be predisposed to behaviors which stimulate dopamine transmission, such as alcoholism or substance abuse. In this study, we attempted to confirm the association between the A1 allele and lower D2 receptor density, and explored a possible association between the B1 allele and D2 receptor expression. Genotypes at the Taq1 'A' and 'B' systems were determined in 70 subjects who underwent in vivo measurement of D2 receptors-binding potential with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and the selective dopamine D2 receptor radiotracer [123I]IBZM. [123I]IBZM-binding potential was identical in A1 carriers (i.e., subjects heterozygous or homozygous for that allele) (230 +/- 85 ml g-1, n = 27) and A1 noncarriers (231 +/- 70 ml g-1, n = 43). Similarly, we found no effect of the B1 allele on [123I]IBZM-binding potential. In conclusion, the results of this study failed to replicate the previously reported association between A1 allele and lower D2 receptor expression.

AB  - This study has examined the association between circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma cyclic GMP and urinary cyclic GMP in relation to hypertension and reduced renal function in 30 normotensives, in 30 patients with essential hypertension and in 22 patients with stable dialysis-independent chronic renal failure (CRF). Plasma ANP was significantly raised (about two-three-fold) in the CRF group compared with the hypertensive and normal groups; plasma cyclic GMP was also significantly raised in the CRF group (median group values: 4.6, 5.8 and 11.0 pmol/ml, respectively, for the normal, hypertensive and CRF groups). There were no significant differences in urinary cyclic GMP between the normotensives and hypertensives but urinary cyclic GMP was significantly reduced in the patients with CRF (median group values: 407.1, 450.9 and 247.8 pmol/min for the normal, hypertensive and CRF groups, respectively, P < 0.001). In the subjects with CRF, the clearance of cyclic GMP was reduced in proportion to the clearance of creatinine, but there was no significant difference in the fractional excretion of cyclic GMP (median group values: 78.1% in the normal group, 78.9% in the hypertensive group and 70.2% in the CRF group). In all groups, there was no association between circulating ANP and urinary cyclic GMP: By contrast, there was a positive association between plasma ANP and plasma cyclic GMP (r = 0.39 P < 0.001) that was independent of blood pressure or renal function. These results demonstrate that while a substantial amount of urinary cyclic GMP originates from the glomerular filtrate, to some extent, raised plasma ANP also contributes to the circulating levels of cyclic GMP. However, plasma cyclic GMP cannot be taken as a direct substitute for plasma ANP.

TI  - A profile of health care utilization of the disabled population in Manitoba.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study profiled health care utilization by disabled and nondisabled individuals in the Canadian province of Manitoba to evaluate the association between health care utilization and disability. METHODS: Age-standardized annualized utilization rates were calculated according to sex using longitudinal data on individual encounters with the Manitoba health care system from 1983 to 1990. Associations between severity of disability, number of prior chronic conditions, and prospective utilization were examined using multivariate regressions. RESULTS: Utilization patterns of the mildly disabled and the nondisabled differed only slightly. Severely disabled individuals had much higher rates of contact and consumed more resources, even after controlling for chronic conditions. The severely disabled accounted for 3% of the population and consumed 16% of hospital days and 7% of physician costs annually. CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasize the importance of incorporating measures of disability in health services research. Both the severity of disability and the number of chronic conditions had independent value in predicting health care utilization. This has important implications for data collection and for the allocation of health care resources for research, which has traditionally been targeted toward fatal chronic conditions.

AB  - Record linkage was carried out between the national Registry of AIDS and 13 Cancer Registries (CRs) covering, in 1991, about 15% of the Italian population. Observed and expected numbers of cancers and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were assessed in 6067 persons with AIDS, for a total of 25,759 person-years. Significantly increased SIRs were found for Hodgkin's disease [8.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4-16.0], in which seven of 11 cases were of mixed cellularity type; invasive carcinoma of the cervix uteri (15.5; 95% CI 4.0-40.1); and non-melanomatous skin cancer (3.0, 95% CI 1.3-5.9), in which five of eight cases were basal cell carcinoma. An excess was also seen for brain tumours, but this may be partly due to misdiagnosis of brain non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or other brain diseases occurring near the time of the AIDS diagnosis. The risk for all cancer types, after exclusion of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), was approximately twice the general population risk. An increased SIR for Hodgkin's disease in persons with AIDS is thus confirmed, though it is many times smaller than that for NHL.  An association with invasive carcinoma of the cervix is also shown at a population level. The excess of non-melanomatous skin cancer seems to be lower than in transplant recipients.

TI  - Host reactive donor T cells are associated with lung injury after experimental allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.  
AB  - Noninfectious lung injury is common after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but its association with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is unclear. Using a murine BMT system where donor and host differ by multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens, we investigated the nature of lung injury and its relationship both to systemic GVHD and host-reactive donor T cells. Lethally irradiated CBA hosts received syngeneic BMT or allogeneic (B10.BR) T-cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) with and without the addition of T cells. Six weeks after BMT, significant pulmonary histopathology was observed in animals receiving allogeneic BMT compared with syngeneic controls. Lung damage was greater in mice that received allogeneic T cells and developed GVHD, but it was also detectable after TCD BMT when signs of clinical and histologic acute GVHD were absent. In each setting, lung injury was associated with significant alterations in pulmonary function. Mature, donor (Vbeta6(+) and Vbeta3(+)) T cells were significantly increased in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of all allogeneic BMT recipients compared with syngeneic controls, and these cells proliferated and produced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to host antigens in vitro. These in vitro responses correlated with increased IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the BAL fluid. We conclude that alloreactive donor lymphocytes are associated with lung injury in this allogeneic BMT model. The expansion of these cells in the BAL fluid and their ability to respond to host antigens even when systemic tolerance has been established (ie, the absence of clinical GVHD) suggest that the lung may serve as a sanctuary site for these host reactive donor T cells. These findings may have important implications with regard to the evaluation and treatment of pulmonary dysfunction after allogeneic BMT even when clinical GVHD is absent.

TI  - A gene involved in XY sex reversal is located on chromosome 9, distal to marker D9S1779.  
AB  - The genetic mechanisms involved in sex differentiation are poorly understood, and progress in identification of the genes involved has been slow. The fortuitous finding of chromosomal rearrangements in association with a sex-reversed phenotype has led to the isolation of SRY and SOX9, both shown to be involved in the sex-determining pathway. In addition, duplications of the X chromosome, deletions of chromosomes 9 and 10, and translocations involving chromosome 17 have been reported to be associated with abnormal testicular differentiation, leading to male-to-female sex reversal in 46,XY individuals. We present the cytogenetic and molecular analyses of four sex-reversed XY females, each with gonadal dysgenesis and other variable malformations, and with terminal deletions of distal chromosome 9p, resulting from unbalanced autosomal translocations. PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis of SRY revealed no mutations in the high-mobility-group domain (i.e., HMG box) in any of the four patients. Conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses of metaphase chromosomes from each patient suggest that the smallest region of overlap (SRO) of deletions involves a very small region of distal band 9p24. Loss-of-heterozygosity studies using 17 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, as well as FISH using YAC clones corresponding to the most distal markers on 9p, showed that the SRO lies distal to marker D9S1779. These results significantly narrow the putative sex-determining gene to the very terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 9.

TI  - Identification of genetic markers associated with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in an Afrikaner population.  
AB  - Because gene-mapping efforts, using large kindreds and parametric methods of analysis, for the neurologic disorder Tourette syndrome have failed, efforts are being redirected toward association studies in young, genetically isolated populations. The availability of dense marker maps makes it feasible to search for association throughout the entire genome. We report the results of such a genome scan using DNA samples from Tourette patients and unaffected control subjects from the South African Afrikaner population. To optimize mapping efficiency, we chose a two-step strategy. First, we screened pools of DNA samples from both affected and control individuals, using a dense collection of 1,167 short tandem-repeat polymorphisms distributed throughout the genome. Second, we typed those markers displaying evidence of allele frequency-distribution shifts, along with additional tightly linked markers, using DNA from each affected and unaffected individual. To reduce false positives, we tested two independent groups of case and control subjects. Strongest evidence for association (P values 10-2 to 10-5) were obtained for markers within chromosomal regions encompassing D2S1790 near the chromosome 2 centromere, D6S477 on distal 6p, D8S257 on 8q, D11S933 on 11q, D14S1003 on proximal 14q, D20S1085 on distal 20q, and D21S1252 on 21q.

For the high-affinity interaction (ka = 10(5) M-1 s-1, kd = 10(-2) s-1, KAX = 10(7) M-1) the ligate concentration was depleted by up to 35%, and hence its assumed constancy was clearly an untenable approximation. Whereas no symptomatic evidence of such violation (apart from the return of incorrect estimates of ka and kd) was evident from pseudo-first-order kinetic analysis of the adsorption profiles, the corresponding analysis of desorption profiles was more informative in that the data deviated demonstrably from pseudo-first-order kinetic behavior. A second-order kinetic analysis was therefore developed and shown to be applicable to adsorption and desorption profiles, irrespective of the validity or otherwise of the pseudo-first-order kinetic approximation. Experimental results obtained for the interaction of histidine-rich glycoprotein with immobilized IgG were then used to illustrate various features of the pseudo-first-order and second-order kinetic analyses, and to determine from the second-order analysis an association equilibrium constant of 2 x 10(8) M-1, which is 20-fold greater than the value obtained by interpretation of the profiles in terms of pseudo-first-order kinetic behavior.

A significant association between the VNTR polymorphism and bipolar disorder (genotypic association: odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0; allelic association: odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0) was found, but not between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and bipolar disorder.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms: ethnic difference and possible association with bipolar affective disorder.  
AB  - There is some evidence suggesting that a polymorphism of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the second intron of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and another variation which lies 1.2 kb upstream of the promoter of the gene (5-HTTLPR) are associated with affective disorders. However, conflicting results have also been reported. We examined an allelic association of these two polymorphisms in a Japanese sample of 191 patients with affective disorders (142 bipolar and 49 unipolar) and 212 controls. Substantial differences in the number and frequency of alleles between Caucasians and Japanese were observed for both polymorphisms.  A significant association between the VNTR polymorphism and bipolar disorder (genotypic association: odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0; allelic association: odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0) was found, but not between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and bipolar disorder. No significant association with unipolar depression was detected using either genetic marker, although this may be attributable to the relatively small number of subjects with unipolar depression. Our results suggest that the VNTR itself or another unknown functional polymorphism which would be in linkage disequilibrium to the VNTR has an effect on susceptibility to bipolar disorder.

TI  - A prospective multicenter study of hepatocellular carcinoma in italian hemophiliacs with chronic hepatitis C. The Study Group of the Association of Italian Hemophilia Centers.  
AB  - To assess the risk factors, natural history, and eligibility for curative treatment of early-detected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 385 hemophiliacs who were treated with blood or plasma derivates for at least 10 years and had persistently elevated aminotransferase values underwent an annual screening with an abdominal ultrasound examination and measurement of the serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Of these, 355 had serum antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), 29 had anti-HCV and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and one had HBsAg alone; 141 had serum antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). During 48 months of follow-up study, six patients developed HCC. All HCC patients had a HCV-related cirrhosis and had been exposed to HCV risk at a median age of 40 years. All patients had a multicentric tumor, which was not eligible for curative treatment. Univariate analysis showed age, cirrhosis, and baseline AFP levels to be significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC. By multivariate analysis, the risk of HCC was infinite in patients with cirrhosis, 31.0 for those with baseline AFP higher than 11 ng/mL, and 17.9 for those more than 45 years of age. In conclusion, the risk of cancer was greater for patients infected later in life, particularly those with cirrhosis and high AFP. Annual screening of hemophiliacs with ultrasound and AFP fails to identify potentially curable tumors because the diagnosis is made at a late stage of the disease.

TI  - Adrenomedullin, endothelin, neuropeptide Y, atrial, brain, and C-natriuretic prohormone peptides compared as early heart failure indicators.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES:The present investigation was designed to determine the best endogenous plasma marker of early congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Forty volunteers with mild CHF (New York Heart Association Class I, n = 12), moderate (Class II, n = 8), or severe (Class III and Class IV, each = n of 5) and 10 age-matched healthy individuals had the simultaneous evaluation of their respective plasma samples by the following radioimmunoassays: atrial natriuretic peptide, ANP; three N-terminal ANP prohormone assays, i.e., proANPs 1-30, 31-67, and 79-98 with the numbers referring to their amino acid (a.a.) sequences in their 126 a.a. prohormone; brain (BNP) and C-natriuretic peptides; N-terminal BNP prohormone; adrenomedullin; neuropeptide Y and endothelin. RESULTS: ProANPs 31-67, 1-30 and 79-98 had 100% (P = 0.01), 83% (P = 0.09) and 50% (P = 0.74) sensitivity in differentiating Class I CHF subjects from healthy subjects. The ANP, BNP, NT-proBNP, CNP, adrenomedullin, neuropeptide Y, and endothelin assays could not differentiate mild CHF subjects from healthy individuals. Logistic regression analysis revealed that only proANP 31-67 significantly (P = 0.0001) discriminated between early CHF (5226 +/- 377 pg/ml) and healthy individuals (1595 +/- 157 pg/ml). The positive and negative predicative values of proANP 31-67 were excellent (100% for each). The peptides measured in these assays were found to be independent markers of CHF with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: ProANPs 31-67 is the most sensitive marker in discriminating NYHA Class I CHF subjects from healthy individuals. The ANP, BNP, NT-proBNP, CNP, adrenomedullin, neuropeptide Y and endothelin radioimmunoassays cannot discern mild CHF. These peptides are independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.

TI  - A population based survey of hepatitis B virus infection in a southern Italian town [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The level of endemicity and modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus infection may change over time. AIMS: To assess prevalence of and risk factors for hepatitis B infection in the general population. SUBJECTS: A total of 1352 subjects residing in a Southern Italian town in the year 1996. METHODS: Subjects were selected from the census by a systematic 1:4 random sampling procedure. Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen were detected by ELISA.  The association (Odds Ratio) linking hepatitis B seropositivity to potential risk factors was estimated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The participation rate was 96.6%. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen were 0.8% and 21.5%, respectively. Hepatitis B surface antigen prevalence was 0.2% in subjects younger than 30 years, peaked to 2.5% in the age-group 40-49 years, and decreased to 0.3% in those 60 years and older. Antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen positivity linearly increased from 6.2% in subjects < 30 years of age to 37.1% in those 60 years or older (p < 0.01). The results of multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age > 45 years (Odds Ratio = 1.9; Confidence Intervals 95% = 1.2-3.0), use of glass syringes (Odds Ratio = 2.2; Confidence Intervals 95% = 1.5-3.4), surgical intervention (Odds Ratios = 1.8; Confidence Intervals: 95% = 1.3-2.6), and positivity for antibodies to hepatitis C virus infection (Odds Ratios = 2.6; Confidence Intervals 95% = 1.5-4.3) were all independent predictors of the likelihood of hepatitis B positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Given that a significant proportion of the general population undergoes surgical intervention, the association found between hepatitis B positivity and this exposure highlights the importance of further developing efficient procedures for the sterilization of instruments as well as the use of disposable materials to control the spread of infection.

TI  - Autism in tuberous sclerosis complex.  
AB  - The frequency and clinical presentation of autism in 28 probands with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are reported and risk factors that may influence the development of autism in TSC are examined. Eight probands meet ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for autism, an additional 4 meet criteria for pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Twelve TSC probands with autism/PDD are compared to 16 TSC probands without these conditions for factors which may underlie the association of autism and TSC. A specific seizure type, infantile spasms, as well as mental retardation, are increased in the TSC, autistic/PDD group. Furthermore, rates of social phobia and substance abuse are elevated among first-degree relatives of TSC probands with autism compared to first-degree relatives of TSC probands without autism. Implications of these findings in understanding the association of autism and TSC are discussed.
