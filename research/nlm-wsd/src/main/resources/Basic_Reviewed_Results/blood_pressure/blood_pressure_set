TI  - Comparison of the combination of enalapril and a very low dose of hydrochlorothiazide with atenolol in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Scandinavian Study Group.  
AB  -  The blood pressure lowering effect and tolerability of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril combined with a very low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared with the selective betareceptor blocker atenolol in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Three hundred seventy-four patients were randomized into a triple-blind, parallel, active-controlled 12-week study period comparing enalapril/HCTZ (20/6 mg) with atenolol (50 mg) after a 4-week placebo baseline period. Blood pressure (BP), clinical and laboratory safety, and metabolic laboratory variables were assessed. Enalapril/HCTZ as well as atenolol reduced both sitting and standing diastolic and systolic BP (P < .001), but enalapril/HCTZ had a more pronounced effect than atenolol on sitting systolic BP (P = .019); there was a trend toward more patients achieving target diastolic BP (<90 mm Hg, P = .053). No clinically important differences in safety and tolerability were observed.

TI  - Nitric oxide and the renin angiotensin system: contributions to blood pressure in the young rat.  
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic administration of the arginine analogue L-Name (50 mg/kg body weight), the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg/kg body weight), and perindopril (2 mg/kg) plus L-Name (50 mg/kg) on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensinogen, and hepatic angiotensinogen mRNA levels in young and adult rats. The drugs were given daily from birth to day 21 to puppies and for 15 days to adults. Analytical procedures were performed on day 21 for the puppies and at 10 weeks for the adults. In puppies, blood pressure did not change with L-Name, it decreased to 45% of control values (P < 0.001) with perindopril, and decreased to 77% of control values (P < 0.05) with perindopril plus L-Name. In adults, blood pressure increased to 129% of control values (P < 0.02) with L-Name, decreased to 80% of control values (P < 0.05) with perindopril, and did not change with perindopril plus L-Name. Compared with controls, plasma renin activity was unchanged in puppies and adults with L-Name, undetectable in puppies and slightly increased in adults with perindopril, undetectable in puppies and slightly decreased in adults with perindopril plus L-Name. With L-Name, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies and slightly increased in adults, while plasma angiotensinogen levels were decreased (P < 0.05) in puppies and increased (P < 0.01) in adults; with perindopril, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies and slightly decreased in adults, while plasma angiotensinogen levels were undetectable in puppies and decreased (P < 0.05) in adults; with perindopril plus L-Name, angiotensinogen mRNA levels were unchanged in puppies while plasma angiotensinogen levels were undetectable in puppies and decreased (P < 0.01) in adults. This study suggests that during the early postnatal period (1) nitric oxide does not exert a basal vasodilator tone but contributes to the hypotensive state induced by perindopril, (2) angiotensin II is essential to maintain blood pressure, (3) and angiotensinogen mRNA levels are not influenced by nitric oxide or angiotensin II.

TI  - Validation of a telemetry system for measurement of blood pressure, electrocardiogram and locomotor activity in beagle dogs.  
AB  - A model is described for the continuous recording of arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram and locomotor activity by telemetry in conscious unrestrained beagle dogs. Validation of the system was accomplished by simultaneous acute catheterisation and telemetry recording ten weeks after implantation, under anaesthesia. Systolic, mean and diastolic pressures, measured over 30-40 mm Hg, were not significantly different. Telemetric measurements in their home cage over several days revealed clear diurnal variations in blood pressure, heart rate, locomotor activity and contractility (QA-interval). Despite these diurnal variations the 24 h mean values were highly reproducible. This model was further characterised by pharmacological interventions designed to increase contractility (ouabain) and blood pressure (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) and to lower blood pressure (isosorbide-5 mononitrate and molsidomine). The high daily reproducibility of cardiovascular parameters allowed each dog to be used as its own control and allowed investigation of these long-acting active agents, which would not have been possible with conventional methods for cardiovascular measurement. These findings demonstrate the utility of this model for investigations into blood pressure regulation as well as the potential for pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Diurnal changes of blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during sleep in the rat.  
AB  - We have studied diurnal changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and body temperature (Tb) during wake (W), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and REM sleep (REMS) in the rat. Although HR and Tb show a similar sinusoidal diurnal variation during all vigilance states, the diurnal profile for the MAP is vigilance-state dependent. During W, MAP values are higher during the dark phase, during NREMS, no significant diurnal change is seen, and during REMS, the MAP exhibits a reversed diurnal change, being higher during the light phase. The low frequency component (0.25 - 0.725 Hz) in the power spectral density of the blood pressure, and index of sympathetic activity, is also higher during the light phase than the dark phase in REMS. The present findings suggest that diurnal changes in MAP in the rat result from the wake rhythm, and that the mechanism for the diurnal control of MAP may be different from that for HR or Tb.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure in hypertension with particular reference to the kidney.  
AB  -  Ambulatory blood pressure is more closely related to the end organ damage of hypertension than clinic blood pressure is. This is the case not only for left ventricular hypertrophy, but also for an index of renal involvement such as microalbuminuria. The closer correlation of ambulatory blood pressure with end organ damage characterises not only the 24 hour average value but also, to a similar extent, day-time and night-time average blood pressure, while the clinical importance of the difference between day and night blood pressure is still a matter of controversy. A more promising index derived from ambulatory blood pressure recordings seems to be blood pressure variability, which in preliminary studies has been shown to display an independent correlation with the end organ damage of hypertension.

TI  - Short-term estrogen administration ameliorates dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine whether short-term estrogen administration ameliorates dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with a marked reduction in the risk of CAD. Estrogen has been reported to have both short- and long-term effects on the cardiovascular system. However, it remains to be examined whether short-term estrogen administration ameliorates myocardial ischemia caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand in postmenopausal women with CAD. METHODS: Eight postmenopausal women with proved CAD underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). DSE was performed three times in a placebo-controlled, double-blind manner: 1) 30 min after intravenous administration of saline solution (placebo) and after 2) a low dose (1.25 mg) and 3) a high dose (10 mg) of conjugated estrogen. The effects of estrogen were compared at the maximal comparable stage of DSE, which was the maximal DSE level that the same patient achieved in all three examinations. RESULTS: Estrogen dose-dependently ameliorated the dobutamine-induced worsening of symptoms (prolonging time to onset of symptoms by 52% [low dose] and 72% [high dose]), electrocardiographic findings (decreasing the magnitude of summed ST segment changes by 36% [low dose] and 76% [high dose]) and left ventricular wall motion (reducing the wall motion score index by 50% [low dose] and 77% [high dose], all p < 0.01 by analysis of variance). There was no significant difference in blood pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product among the three examinations at the maximal comparable stage of DSE. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen has short-term anti-ischemic effects on the myocardial ischemia induced by increased myocardial oxygen demand in postmenopausal women with CAD.

TI  - Impact of antihypertensive therapy on the skeleton: effects of moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide on osteopenia in spontaneously hypertensive ovariectomized rats.  
AB  - Skeletal effects of moexipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic, were studied in ovariectomized (OVX) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Moexipril (10 mg/kg per day), HCTZ (10 mg/kg per day), alone or in combination, as well as 17 alpha-estradiol (30 micrograms/kg per day) were given to OVX SHR immediately after surgery and studied for short- and long-term effects (14 and 56 days respectively). All drugs were given orally. Histomorphometric data on the secondary spongiosa of proximal tibial metaphyses (cancellous bone) and tibiofibular junctions of tibial shafts (cortical bone) were analyzed. Ovariectomy induced cancellous bone loss in SHR by inducing negative bone balance. Estrogen prevented ovariectomy-induced cancellous bone loss in the SHR by reducing bone turnover and partially suppressing the coupling of bone formation to resorption on the endocortical surface. HCTZ reduced blood pressure after 1 week of treatment, yet this effect was no lower than that seen in controls after 3 weeks of treatment. Two weeks of HCTZ transiently prevented ovariectomy-induced increases in bone turnover rate and eroded surface. This delayed ovariectomy induced trabecular bone loss in the proximal tibial metaphysis, but had no effect on the tibial shaft. Like HCTZ, moexipril also reduced blood pressure after the first week of treatment but it had no apparent effect on either the proximal tibial metaphysis or the tibial shaft. A combination of moexipril and HCTZ exhibited a much more potent hypotensive effect and had the same effect on bone mass and dynamic end-points as HCTZ alone. Our data indicate that (1) HCTZ treatment has some transient beneficial effects on both antihypertension and osteoprotection in hypertensive osteopenic rats, (2) the combination of moexipril with HCTZ improved the antihypertensive effect but did not potentiate or hamper the osteoprotective effect of HCTZ, and (3) the skeletal effect of estrogen is not impacted by the hypertensive state. These findings are relevant for the use of ACE inhibitor and thiazide diuretics, alone or in combination, in antihypertensive therapy in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Subcortical silent brain infarction as a risk factor for clinical stroke.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No prospective studies have examined the rate of symptomatic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in patients with subcortical silent brain infarction (SSBI) who were otherwise neurologically normal at entry into the study. This report investigates SSBI, detected by MRI, as a clinical stroke risk factor. METHODS: MRI scans were performed in 933 neurologically normal adults (30 to 81 years; mean age, 57.5 +/- 9.2 years) without history of cerebrovascular diseases who received our health screening of the brain 1 to 7 years before investigation. We obtained information of their clinical stroke onset through sending out a questionnaire for subjects. We detected SSBI (focal T2 hyperintensities larger than 3 mm with correlative T1 hypointensity), FWT2HL (focal white matter T2 hypertensity lesions similar to SSBI but without correlative T2-hypointensity), and PVH (periventricular hyperintensity) by MRI. Age, sex, family history of stroke, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipids, hematocrit, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, smoking, alcohol habits, ischemic changes on electrocardiogram, and sclerotic changes of retinal arteries were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Incidence of SSBI was 10.6% in all subjects. No cortical infarct was detected in this series. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95% CI, 2.57 to 6.45), diabetes (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.85), alcohol habits > or = 58 g/day (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.50 to 4.45), retinal artery sclerosis (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.38), and age (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.38) were significant and independent risk factors for SSBI. For FWT2HL, hypertension (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.54 to 7.96) and age (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.45 to 3.00) were also independent risk factors. Risk factors for PVH were age (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.23 to 5.36), hypertension (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.62 to 5.78), and retinal artery sclerosis (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.96). We found 14 brain infarctions, 4 brain hemorrhages, and 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage during observation. Annual incidence of clinical stroke was higher in the subjects with SSBI than in those without focal lesions (10.1% versus 0.77%). ORs for clinical stroke onset were 10.48 for SSBI (95% CI, 3.63 to 30.21) and 4.81 for FWT2HL (95% CI, 1.13 to 20.58). The PVH did not relate to clinical stroke onset. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of SSBI, FWT2HL, and PVH with hypertension suggests a common underlying mechanism (presumably small-vessel vasculopathy). The SSBI showed the most significant association for clinical subcortical stroke. The FWT2HL was also a risk factor for the stroke but was less significant than SSBI. The subjects with SSBI should be considered at high risk for clinical subcortical brain infarction or brain hemorrhage.

TI  - Cyclosporine dose adjustment using levels obtained six hours after the morning dose: effect on side effects in patients with autoimmune diseases.  
AB  - Cyclosporine (CsA) is frequently used for nontransplant indications such as autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, side effects such as renal dysfunction and hypertension are frequently described in spite of close monitoring with CsA trough levels. The purpose of the present prospective cohort study was to use the CsA level obtained 6 h after the morning dose (T6) for CsA dose adjustment and its impact on observed side effects in 11 patients (44+/-17 years) treated with CsA for autoimmune diseases. Patients were monitored for CsA-related side effects at each outpatient visit, including blood pressure measurement, CsA trough and T6 levels and routine laboratory tests. Changes in blood pressure and biochemical parameters were compared to the previous visit (n = 244) and a change >30% was considered significant. Significant changes in monitored variables were observed in the following percentage of visits: increases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure (1.2), serum creatinine (6.1), potassium (0.8), and uric acid (6.3), and a decrease in magnesium (0.5). At the end of follow-up (20+/-12.5 months), CsA dose was reduced from 4.8+/-1.1 to 3.5+/-1 mg/kg/day (p = 0.004); serum creatinine, potassium, uric acid, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate did not differ from baseline. Alkaline phosphatase increased from 63+/-19 to 82+/-21 U/l(p = 0.04) and magnesium decreased from 0.85+/-0.1 to 0.75+/-0.1 mmol/l (p = 0.02). Transient hypertension and reversible renal dysfunction was seen in 2 patients, respectively. In conclusion, CsA monitoring according to T6 levels may allow a lower CsA dose than the one usually recommended and reduce the incidence of side effects in patients with autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Serum hepatocyte growth factor as a possible indicator of arteriosclerosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible involvement of hepatocyte growth factor in arteriosclerotic lesions, by studying the relationship between serum concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor and grades of retinal arteriosclerosis. METHODS: We measured the blood pressure, body mass index, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and hepatocyte growth factor, erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit levels of 112 adults. Serum concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor were measured by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For each subject, photographs of both optic fundi were taken, and the grade of arteriosclerotic changes in the retinal arteries was evaluated according to Scheie's classification. RESULTS: Individuals with more advanced grades of arteriosclerotic changes had higher serum hepatocyte growth factor values (grade 0, 0.056 +/- 0.004 ng/ml, n = 86; grade 1, 0.132 +/- 0.026 ng/ml, n = 17, P < 0.01, versus grade 0; grade 2-3, 0.271 +/- 0.023 ng/ml, n = 9, P < 0.01, versus grades 0 and 1). The serum hepatocyte growth factor concentrations were also correlated significantly to the serum uric acid concentrations (r = 0.230, P = 0.015) and erythrocyte counts (r = 0.299, P = 0.001), but not to the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and other physical and humoral parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hepatocyte growth factor levels are thought to indicate the presence or development of arteriosclerotic lesions and may be a useful biochemical parameter for estimating the development of systemic arteriosclerosis irrespective of blood pressure levels.

TI  - Comparisons of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and repeated office measurements in primary care [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of office blood pressure (BP) readings is questionable because of blood pressure variability and measurement errors. The primary aim of this study was to determine the number of office visits required to optimize the estimation of usual blood pressure in older adults in primary care. METHODS: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was used to define usual blood pressure in an observational study of 75 randomly selected family practice patients. Each subject made six visits for office BP measurements and had 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring done twice. Mean office BP, based on one through six visits, was compared with mean ambulatory BP. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 29 men and 46 women; 18 were black and 57 were white. Twenty-one subjects were taking antihypertensive medication. The mean age +/- 1/standard deviation (SD) was 60 (+/- 8) years. The correlation between mean office BP and mean ambulatory BP rose with the number of visits averaged, with most of the gain obtained within 3 visits. The maximal correlation for 24-hour ambulatory BP was r = .85/.75 (systolic/diastolic) (P < .01). However, even when using average office BP over six visits to estimate mean ambulatory BP, a discrepancy of > or = 10 mm Hg between estimated and observed ambulatory BP levels persisted in 18% to 20% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Readings from at least three office visits should be averaged to estimate usual blood pressure. It should be noted, however, that important discrepancies between estimated and observed mean ambulatory BP persist even after readings taken over six visits. Ambulatory BP monitoring probably provides unique information about usual blood pressure that cannot be captured by repeated office BP readings.

AB  - The DNA of AVP vasopressin (AVP) is composed of 3 exons (A, B, C) and 2 introns (I, II). Following transcription, translation, and processing AVP(MW 1081) is produced. AVP receptors (VR) are classified into V1aR, V1bR and V2R. V1aR is composed of 418 amino acids (AA) and its MW is 46745. V1aR is in the vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and activates the phosphatidylinositol system, leading to the contraction of VSM. V1bR is composed of 424 AA and its MW 47034. It's second messenger systems are obscure, but V1bR is responsible for ACTH release. V2R is composed of 371 AA and its MW 40285. V2R is in the kidney and enhances the production of cAMP, leading to renal water and urea reabsorption.

TI  - [Diagnosis of blood flow in breast tumors with increased blood pressure. New possibility in tumor field diagnosis]  
AB  - On the assumption that the architecture of blood vessels of malignant tumors, formed by neoangiogenesis, shows characteristics that are different from those of blood vessels of benign tumors or physiological findings, we have tried in the present study to investigate the behavior of these different vessels under increased blood pressure. Using a special stand, the same sonographic section could be stably maintained during an examination time of approx. 4 minutes. Using a new computer program, the color pixels of the employed Angio color technique were quantified and recorded as a function of the measured blood pressure. To increase blood pressure, the patient had to press a hand grip, which practically always caused a systolic blood pressure elevation of more than 15-20 mmHg. Seventy patients with sonographically detected breast tumors were examined; 54 (14 benign and 40 malignant tumors) could be included in the evaluation. We found four typical types of curves: Curve type 1 is associated with an instantaneous increase in blood flow with increased blood pressure, followed by a drop in the blood pressure, with a slow decrease in blood flow as the blood pressure drops (with 29 malignant and 3 benign tumors). Curve type 2 shows a continuous increase in blood flow-though somewhat delayed with respect to the rise in blood pressure-which is also observed when the blood pressure drops (exclusively benign tumors). In curve type 3, maximum blood flow is reached after the blood pressure maximum, and then the blood flow decreases (1 benign and 3 malignant tumors). Curve type 4 features decreased blood flow in spite of increased blood pressure (3 benign and 5 malignant tumors). The described quantification method, in combination with the stand, permits for the first time analysis of a tumor under increased blood pressure as to its blood flow behavior over time in an examination using a challenge test. Here one can find two distinctive curve types (types 1 and 2) that correlate mostly with malignant (type 1) or benign (type 2) breast tumors. Should this tendency be substantiated by additional large-scale studies, it would seem that a new ultrasonic possibility for differential diagnosis has been found.

A 20-week, postmarketing surveillance study of the effectiveness and patient tolerability of nifedipine GITS 30 or 60 mg was conducted in the offices of 187 Canadian general practitioners from September 1992 to March 1994. A total of 1700 patients previously or newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 114 mm Hg) were included. The 20-week treatment period was completed by 1326 patients. Patients received nifedipine GITS 30 mg initially; the dose could be titrated upward to 60 mg after 3 and 6 weeks. Of all patients entered, 605 (35.6%) reported one or more adverse events. The three most frequently occurring adverse events were headache (12.2%), peripheral edema (8.1%), and dizziness (2.9%). The frequency of adverse events was highest in the first 3 weeks and decreased subsequently. The overall incidence of adverse events was 29.8% in patients receiving 30 mg of nifedipine GITS and 25.3% in those receiving 60 mg; adverse events were the cause of study discontinuation in 12.3% of patients. The overall health status of patients as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire was comparable to that previously reported for healthy individuals. At baseline, mean (+/- SE) systolic/diastolic blood pressure values for all patients were 160.1 +/- 0.4/97.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg.  Final blood pressure readings after 20 weeks of treatment in the 30-mg group (141.5 +/- 0.4/84.8 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and the 60-mg group (146.6 +/- 0.8/88.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) were significantly decreased from baseline. At week 20, the 30-mg dose was sufficient to maintain blood pressure in 74.5% of patients; 25.5% of patients required 60 mg. Subgroup analysis revealed similar responses in patients who had received blood pressure medication before study initiation and those who had not. Response was also independent of age and type of previous antihypertensive therapy. In general medical practice, the 30-mg and 60-mg doses of nifedipine GITS were both effective and well tolerated and had minimal or no negative effects on the overall health status of treated individuals.

TI  - Body mass index and cardiovascular risk factors in Pacific Island Polynesians and Europeans in New Zealand.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine relationships between body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular risk factors in 279 Europeans and 231 Polynesian Pacific Islanders in New Zealand. METHODS: Participants were recruited from Seventh-Day Adventist church meetings or camps, and were surveyed by self-administered questionnaire.  Blood pressure, weight and height were measured. Fasting blood samples were analysed for lipids, glucose and fructosamine. RESULTS: Age-adjusted BMI was higher in Pacific Islanders than in Europeans: 32.8(0.3) versus 25.6(0.3); means(SE); p = 0.0001). In Europeans, BMI was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and fasting blood glucose, and negatively associated with HDL cholesterol. In Pacific Islanders, BMI was associated only with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and with HDL cholesterol. These associations were stronger in Europeans than in Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of Pacific Islanders, the association between BMI and cardiovascular risk factors was weaker than in Europeans. This suggests that either BMI is a poor measure of adiposity in Pacific Islanders, or that adiposity may be less strongly linked to cardiovascular disease in Pacific Islanders.

TI  - Theodore Cooper Memorial Lecture. A mouse view of hypertension.  
AB  - Essential hypertension probably results from combinations of genetic variations, not necessarily the same in all afflicted persons, which individually may not cause sufficient deviation from normality to be significantly harmful. Genes contributing to hypertension are being sought by analytic experiments aimed at identifying candidate genes associated or segregating with the phenotype in humans and animals and by synthetic experiments in which changes are made in candidate genes in animals and their effects on blood pressure are determined. We have used gene targeting to vary the amounts of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) synthesized from their genes (Agt and Ace). These "gene titration" experiments establish that changes in Agt gene expression cause changes in the blood pressures of mice. Surprisingly, quantitative changes in Ace gene expression over a threefold range do not affect blood pressures. Computer simulations with a simple version of the renin-angiotensin system predict that changes in Agt function alter the steady state levels of both angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II). In contrast, modest changes in Ace function alter Ang I levels considerably but scarcely affect Ang II levels. Simulations over the ranges of ACE levels that can be achieved with ACE inhibitors predict that Ang II levels will decrease only when Ang I levels have plateaued. Comparisons of the computer simulations with our genetic experiments and with prior work of others using wide dose ranges of ACE inhibitor show a satisfactory agreement and help reconcile the apparent contradictions between the genetic and pharmacological experiments.

TI  - Role of angiotensin II in the regulation of a novel vascular modulator, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), in experimental hypertensive rats.  
AB  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mesenchyme-derived pleiotropic factor that regulates cell growth, cell motility, and morphogenesis of various types of cells, and is thus considered a humoral mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions responsible for morphogenic tissue interactions. We have previously reported that HGF is a novel member of endothelium-specific growth factors whose serum concentration is positively associated with blood pressure in humans. Therefore, we speculated that serum HGF secretion might be elevated in response to high blood pressure as a counter-system against endothelial dysfunction. However, it is difficult to elucidate the role of circulating and tissue HGFs in human hypertension. To address this issue, we measured circulating and tissue HGF concentrations in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at different ages. Serum HGF concentration in SHR was significantly higher than that in WKY at 6, 15, and 25 weeks of age (P<.01). Serum HGF concentration was also significantly positively correlated with blood pressure in SHR (P<.02, r=.455). In contrast, tissue HGF concentrations in heart, aorta, and kidney were significantly decreased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age, when these organs showed hypertrophic changes induced by hypertension (P<.01). Cardiac HGF mRNA was also decreased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age. Moreover, cardiac HGF concentration showed a significant negative correlation with left ventricular (LV) weight (P<.01), whereas serum HGF concentration showed a significant positive correlation with LV weight (P<.05). Interestingly, concentrations of cardiac and vascular angiotensin II, a suppressor of HGF, were increased in SHR as compared with WKY at 25 weeks of age (P<.01). Therefore, we examined the effects of angiotensin blockade on circulating and tissue HGF concentrations, to study the role of angiotensin II in HGF regulation. Administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (losartan and HR 720) for 6 weeks resulted in a significant increase in cardiac HGF concentration, accompanied by increased cardiac HGF mRNA, and a significant decrease in serum HGF concentration, accompanied by lowered blood pressure and reduced LV weight (P<.01). Here, we demonstrated increased circulating HGF and decreased vascular, cardiac, and renal HGF in SHR as compared with WKY at the maintenance stage of hypertension. Decreased tissue HGF in target organs of hypertension may be due to increased tissue angiotensin II. These results suggest that decreased local HGF production may have an important role in the cardiovascular remodeling of target organs in hypertension, since HGF prevented endothelial injury and promoted angiogenesis. Blockade of angiotensin augmented local decreased cardiovascular HGF in hypertension, potentially resulting in the improvement of endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - An investigation of the effect of advancing uraemia, renal replacement therapy and renal transplantation on blood pressure diurnal variability.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ambulatory blood pressure recordings have been shown to correlate better with target organ damage than have isolated clinic blood pressure readings. There have been some small studies demonstrating that abnormal blood pressure diurnal rhythm is common in uraemia and in patients on renal replacement therapy. Abnormal blood pressure diurnal rhythm itself may be a risk factor for accelerated target organ damage. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 480 ambulatory blood pressure recordings in 380 patients with essential hypertension, secondary hypertension, and on renal replacement therapy. We examined diurnal blood pressure rhythm in each group. RESULTS: Abnormal blood pressure diurnal rhythm (non-dipping) is significantly more prevalent in patients with underlying renal disease, even with normal excretory renal function (53%) than in age-, sex-, and race-matched controls with essential hypertension ((30%), P < 0.01). In patients with renal disease the prevalence of non-dipping rose with worsening renal function, reaching statistical significance once plasma creatinine was greater than 400 mumol/l. There was a direct correlation between plasma creatinine and percent decline in blood pressure at night for both systolic (r = 0.23) and diastolic (r = 0.24) blood pressure in patients with underlying renal disease and impaired excretory renal function. High prevalences of abnormal diurnal BP rhythm are seen in patients on haemodialysis (82%), peritoneal dialysis (78%), patients with plasma creatinine > 600 mumol/l (75%), and in renal transplant recipients (74%). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal blood pressure diurnal rhythm ('non-dipping') is significantly more common in secondary than in primary hypertension, even with normal renal function. Abnormal blood pressure diurnal rhythm becomes increasingly common with advancing uraemia. Once the plasma creatinine is greater than 600 mumol/l the prevalence of non-dipping is the same as that seen with renal replacement therapy. This phenomenon is not modulated by successful renal transplantation.

TI  - Effect of gender on outcomes following renal artery stent placement for renovascular hypertension [see comments]  
AB  - To study the effect of gender on outcome following renal artery stent placement for renovascular hypertension, we prospectIvely followed 66 patients (30 males, 36 females) who underwent Palmaz stent placement in 89 renal arteries. There was no difference in the incidence of procedure-related complications between males and females. At 6-mo follow-up, the decrease in systolic (35 +/- 30 mm Hg and 27 +/- 25 mm Hg) and diastolic (15 +/- 23 mm Hg and 14 +/- 14 mm Hg) blood pressures was similar in female and male patients, respectIvely. Late follow-up at 19 +/- 11 mo also showed no difference in blood pressure response. In 44 patients who underwent repeat angiography at a mean duration of 9.1 +/- 5.6 mo after stent deployment, the incidence of restenosis was 26% in females and 24% in males (P = 0.85). We conclude that gender has no effect on the incidence of complications, blood pressure response, or angiographic restenosis in patients undergoing renal artery stent placement.

TI  - Comparison of brain tissue metabolic changes during ischemia at 35 degrees and 18 degrees C.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated brain tissue oxygen pressure (PO2), carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) and pH during ischemia with brain temperature at 35 degrees and 18 degrees C in the same patient. METHODS: Surgery was performed in a 60-year-old woman to clip a large aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery (ICA). A Paratrend 7 probe measuring PO2, PCO2, and pH was inserted into tissue at risk for ischemia during ICA occlusion and brain protection was provided with 9% desflurane. One week later, hypothermic circulatory arrest with brain temperature at 18 degrees C was performed for aneurysm clipping and tissue measurements were obtained during ischemia and rewarming. RESULTS: At 35 degrees C, ICA occlusion for 16 minutes produced tissue hypoxia (PO2 = 0) and acidosis (pH = 6.70). The rate of increase of hydrogen ion (H+) reached 50 nEq.L(-1).min(-1) during ICA occlusion and there was a slow recovery of acidosis at the end of the ischemic period. During hypothermic circulatory arrest, tissue PO2 was sensitive to decreases in blood pressure and decreased rapidly during exsanguination. Although tissue pH decreased to 6.5 with 30 min of no pump flow, the rate of H+ increase during hypothermic arrest was one-third of that seen during ischemia at 35 degrees C. During rewarming from profound hypothermia, two phases of recovery from acidosis were observed, one during CO2 clearance and one after tissue reoxygenation. Recovery of acidosis occurred sooner at 18 degrees C than at 35 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that tissue acidosis develops more slowly and recovers more rapidly with hypothermic ischemia. This may be an important mechanism of reduced ischemic injury during hypothermia.

TI  - [Measurement of blood pressure: best way to assess cardiovascular risk?]  
AB  - Measurement of the blood pressure by the physician remains an essential step in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk. Ambulatory measurement and self-measurement of blood pressure are ways of counteracting the "white coat" effect which is the rise in blood pressure many patients experience in the presence of doctors. Thus, it is possible to define the cardiovascular risk of hypertension and identify the patients with the greatest chance of benefiting from antihypertensive therapy. However, it must be realised that normotensive subjects during their everyday activities and becoming hypertensive in the doctor's surgery, may become hypertensive with time, irrespective of the means used to measure blood pressure. These patients should be followed up regularly even if the decision to treat has been postponed.

TI  - Chronopharmacological aspects of PK/PD modelling.  
AB  - Nearly all physiological functions as well as pathophysiological events display reproducible rhythmic changes within 24 hours of a day, including the cardiovascular system. Clinical chronopharmacological studies with antihypertensive drugs gave evidence that effects on the rhythms in blood pressure and heart rate are also dependent on the time of day. Chronopharmacokinetic studies with propranolol, oxprenolol, nifedipine, verapamil, etc. also revealed daily variations in the drugs' kinetics. In general, Cmax was higher and/or tmax shorter after morning than evening dosing of these rather lipophilic drugs. However, independently of whether or not daily variations in the kinetics were found the dose-response relationship was always dependent on the time of day. These data demonstrate that PK/PD modelling has to take into account reproducible rhythmic variations both in the kinetics and/or effects of cardiovascular active drugs.

TI  - The relation of systemic hypertension to changes in the retinal vasculature: the Beaver Dam Eye Study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND PURPOSE: The objective was to investigate the relationship of systemic hypertension to the incidence of various retinal vascular lesions in the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study. METHODS: Subjects aged 43 through 86 years who lived in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin between 1987 and 1988 were examined between 1988 and 1990 and 5 years later, 1993-1995. Blood pressure was measured using standardized protocols. Stereoscopic color fundus photographs were graded in a masked fashion using standardized protocols to determine the presence of retinopathy (blot hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, and venous beading), retinal arteriolar narrowing, and arterio-venous nicking. People with diabetes or retinal vascular occlusions were excluded from the analyses. RESULTS: Among those examined, 2,151 (69.1%) were normotensive and 963 (30.9%) were hypertensive at baseline. Over the five-year period, retinopathy developed in 175 (6.0%), arteriolar narrowing in 282 (9.9%) and arterio-venous nicking in 201 (6.5%) nondiabetic subjects. After adjusting for age, hypertension was associated with the incidence of retinopathy (in men: relative risk [RR] 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54 to 3.48; in women: RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.43) and with arteriolar narrowing (in men: RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.66; in women: RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.77), but not with arterio-venous nicking (in men: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; in women: RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.97). The five-year incidence of retinopathy and of arteriolar narrowing was higher in those subjects whose blood pressure was elevated despite use of antihypertensive medications compared with those subjects whose blood pressure was controlled with antihypertensive medications or those who were normotensive. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a relation of hypertension to an increased incidence of retinopathy and arteriolar narrowing. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic control of blood pressure is related to a lower incidence of these anatomic retinal lesions relative to uncontrolled blood pressure.

We conclude that the known physiological time delay for the sympathetic portion of the baroreflex can account for the observed 0.4-Hz rhythm in rat MAP and that the sensitivity of the baroreceptors to the rate of change in blood pressure, as well as average blood pressure, would enhance the natural stability of the baroreflex.

TI  - First-order differential-delay equation for the baroreflex predicts the 0.4-Hz blood pressure rhythm in rats.  
AB  - We have described a 0.4-Hz rhythm in renal sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) that is tightly coupled to 0.4-Hz oscillations in blood pressure in the unanesthetized rat. In previous work, the relationship between SNA and fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was described by a set of two first-order differential equations. We have now modified our earlier model to test the feasibility that the 0.4-Hz rhythm can be explained by the baroreflex without requiring a neural oscillator. In this baroreflex model, a linear feedback term replaces the sympathetic drive to the cardiovascular system. The time delay in the feedback loop is set equal to the time delay on the efferent side, approximately 0.5 s (as determined in the initial model), plus a time delay of 0.2 s on the afferent side for a total time delay of approximately 0.7 s. A stability analysis of this new model yields feedback resonant frequencies close to 0.4 Hz. Because of the time delay in the feedback loop, the proportional gain may not exceed a value on the order of 10 to maintain stability. The addition of a derivative feedback term increases the system's stability for a positive range of derivative gains. We conclude that the known physiological time delay for the sympathetic portion of the baroreflex can account for the observed 0.4-Hz rhythm in rat MAP and that the sensitivity of the baroreceptors to the rate of change in blood pressure, as well as average blood pressure, would enhance the natural stability of the baroreflex.

TI  - Erectile response to hypothalamic stimulation in rats: role of peripheral nerves.  
AB  - The role of peripheral parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways was explored in erectile responses elicited by hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA) stimulation in adult male anesthetized rats. Under control conditions, MPOA stimulation reliably elicited erectile responses evidenced by an increase of the intracavernous pressure-to-blood pressure ratio. The erectile response was abolished by 1) acute bilateral section of cavernous or pelvic nerves or cauda equina and 2) chronic lesions of pelvic nerves or cauda equina. Acute section of the hypogastric nerve did not significantly decrease the erectile response. The erectile response was significantly depressed after acute or chronic sections of the paravertebral sympathetic chain at the L4-L5 level or chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine. The decrease due to acute sympathetic chain lesion was reversed by bilateral ligation of the external iliac arteries. Accordingly MPOA stimulation elicits erectile responses via 1) activation of the parasympathetic outflow conveyed by the pelvic and cavernous nerves and 2) activation of neural fibers conveyed by the sympathetic pathways. We propose that sympathetic fibers running in the paravertebral sympathetic chain are responsible for vasoconstriction of nonpenile areas to divert blood to the penis, allowing the dramatic increase of penile arterial inflow required for erection.

AB  - We compared tonometry systolic pressure with direct systolic pressure in 12 elderly patients (9 patients with sinus rhythm and 3 patients with atrial fibrillation) and 1 young adult patient undergoing surgical procedures in order to evaluate reliability of continuous blood pressure by arterial tonometry. In elderly patients when blood pressure fluctuated, the differences between tonometry systolic pressure and direct systolic pressure were larger compared with when blood pressure was stable. In the elderly with sinus rhythm, the correlation with stable blood pressure was 0.908; while that with fluctuating blood pressure was 0.838. In atrial fibrillation group, the differences between stable blood pressure and fluctuating blood pressure were still larger. The results indicate that it is difficult to use tonometry method as a reliable tool for blood pressure monitoring in geriatric anesthesia under circumstances of fluctuating blood pressure.

TI  - Hyperinsulinemia, circadian variation of blood pressure and end-organ damage in hypertension.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with essential hypertension display hyperinsulinemia and/or insulin resistance. A relationship between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure has not been conclusively established. Some evidence points to a relationship between hyperinsulinemia and evidence of cardiovascular damage. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the relationship between insulin secretion in response to an oral glucose load, circadian variation of blood pressure, and evidence of vascular damage, measured by the thickness of the carotid artery and urinary albumin excretion. DESIGN: Seventy patients with essential hypertension and 35 healthy volunteers were included in the study. RESULTS: Twenty patients were hyperinsulinemic. Office blood pressure was not different between hypertensive patients with high and those with normal insulin AUC. However, night-time diastolic blood pressure was greater in hypertensive patients with high insulin AUC (93 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) than in those with normal insulin AUC (83.5 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, P < 0.005). The thickness of the carotid artery and urinary albumin excretion were greater (P < 0.05) in patients with high insulin AUC than in patients with normal insulin AUC and normotensive subjects. Insulin AUC was significantly correlated with ambulatory blood pressure, carotid artery thickness, and urine albumin excretion. Multiple regression analysis using insulin AUC as the dependent variable and UAE, triglycerides, body-mass index and office or ambulatory blood pressure as independent variables showed the strongest correlation with urine albumin excretion (P < 0.0001), triglycerides (P < 0.02) and body-mass index (P < 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in patients with essential hypertension hyperinsulinemia is associated with higher levels of nocturnal blood pressure, and greater evidence of vascular damage.

TI  - The role of blood pressure in cognitive impairment in an elderly population. Osservatorio Geriatrico Campano Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional relationship between arterial blood pressure and cognitive impairment in a group of elderly subjects, controlling for such confounding variables as age, education, depression, drug use and antihypertensive treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional survey in Campania, a region in southern Italy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A random sample of 1339 elderly subjects aged 65-95 years (mean 73.9 +/- 6.2 years) selected from the electoral rolls was interviewed by trained physicians. Sociodemographic characteristics, results of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), blood pressure and whether antihypertensive treatment was being administered were recorded. When subjects with neurological diseases and those under psychotropic therapy were excluded from the analyses, the population numbered 1106. RESULTS: The MMSE score was less than 24 for 27.9% of the subjects and the mean GDS score was 10.8 +/- 6.3. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 145.3 +/- 19.0 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 82.0 +/- 9.2 mmHg. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex, age, GDS score and DBP but not SBP were predictive of cognitive impairment. Educational level and antihypertensive treatment, on the contrary, play a protective role. DBP was associated with cognitive impairment in subjects aged 75 years (odds ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.25) and over (odds ratio 5.16, 95% confidence interval 1.50-17.71) but not in those aged 65-74 years. CONCLUSION: DBP but not SBP is predictive of cognitive impairment in subjects aged 75 years and over without neurological disorders independently from sex, age, education, GDS and antihypertensive treatment

TI  - Prediction of left ventricular mass in youth with family histories of essential hypertension.  
AB  - To determine predictors of left ventricular mass (LVM) and hypertrophy (LVH), 56 black and 30 white normotensive healthy youths (mean age 12.6 +/- 2.3 years at initial visit) were studied twice, 2.5 years apart. During the initial visit, anthropometric variables and hemodynamics were measured at rest and before, during, and after 4 physical and behavioral stressors. 2-D directed M-mode echocardiography was performed to derive LVM. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that follow-up LVM was predicted by initial LVM, weight, height (ht), and gender (males > females; total model R2 = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Predictors of LVM/ht2.7 were initial LVM/ht2.7, weight, ethnicity (blacks > whites), and the aggregate index of blood pressure reactivity (total model R2 = 0.66, P < 0.0001). Youth with LVH at follow-up were taller, heavier, and exhibited greater blood pressure reactivity at initial evaluation. These findings are important since interventional strategies can be developed that target obesity and exaggerated reactivity to stress.

While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor.

TI  - Pro-haemorrhagic effects of calcium antagonists: a comparison of isradipine and atenolol on ex vivo platelet function in hypertensive subjects [see comments]  
AB  - It has been suggested that long term treatment with calcium antagonist drugs might inhibit platelet function and lead to an anti-atheromatous effect. However recent data have also suggested that such an effect might increase mortality due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. We identified 43 subjects from general practice with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension to compare the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine with that of the beta-blocker atenolol on platelet function, plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, fibrinolysis, and serum lipids in a randomised double-blind parallel group study. After careful evaluation to exclude concomitant aspirin use, only 24 subjects were eligible to enter the study. While isradipine and atenolol produced comparable and clinically significant falls in blood pressure (167 +/- 2/102 +/- 1 to 153 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, and 165 +/- 2/101 +/- 1 to 156 +/- 4/91 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), neither drug produced a detectable effect on ex vivo platelet aggregation, platelet retention, or thromboxane generation with adrenaline, collagen, adenosine-di-phosphate, or platelet activating factor. However a decrease in plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels was observed which reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) after 12 weeks treatment in the isradipine but not the atenolol group. A 39% reduction with isradipine compared with 34% following atenolol treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was not altered by either drug. Serum cholesterol concentrations were also unaltered by drug treatment. Therapeutic doses of the calcium antagonist isradipine may produce a minor indirect effect on platelet function after several weeks of treatment. However, this is of doubtful clinical importance and may simply reflect an effect of lowered blood pressure on platelet function.

TI  - The relationship between chronic cocaine or alcohol use and blood pressure in black men during uncomplicated tooth extraction.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The object of this study was to determine whether a history of cocaine or alcohol use is associated with blood pressure changes in patients undergoing an uncomplicated mandibular molar extraction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The blood pressure (BP) values of middle-aged (30 to 40 years of age) black men with different chronic drug histories were compared during extraction procedures. The four different groups were 1) no-drug control, (n = 10); 2) alcohol (n = 15); 3) "crack" cocaine (n = 9); and 4) cocaine (n = 22). RESULTS: The cocaine group's blood pressures were significantly different compared with the blood pressures within the no-drug and alcohol groups (P < .05). The cocaine group's BPs decreased throughout the procedure, and the BPs of the no-drug and alcohol groups rose during administration of the local anesthetic and extraction, and then fell. The BPs of the crack group were highly variable and not significantly different when compared with other groups. CONCLUSION: There is a paradoxical effect of chronic cocaine use on blood pressure that needs to be considered when treating such patients.

TI  - Integrative coordination of circadian mammalian diversity: neuronal networks and peripheral clocks.  
AB  - Diverse circadian rhythms are generated, maintained and/or coordinated by brain structures constituting the circadian timing system. However, the mechanisms underlying the variety in activity types and circadian rhythm phases and amplitudes are currently unknown. We address this problem by comparing rhythms in diurnal and nocturnal mammals, while focusing on alterations not involving the central circadian oscillator. The circadian rhythms are divided into two groups: activity-independent and activity-related. The rhythms in the first group have similar acrophases in all mammals and are anticipated to function as an internal zeitgeber (time giver). Analysis of activity-related circadian rhythms in behavior, blood pressure (BP) and renal excretion suggests separate mechanisms in their regulation in addition to the central suprachiasmatic nuclei-located circadian oscillator. We propose that: (a) a passive hypothalamic oscillator coordinates the phases and underlies the high amplitude of behavioral circadian rhythms; (b) a separate rostral hypothalamic network participates in the regulation of the low-amplitude circadian BP rhythm; and (c) a circadian oscillator in the kidney generates electrolyte excretion rhythms. A model is offered where the overt activity is determined by the phase-relationship between the circadian and the passive hypothalamic oscillator. Specific brain structures or peripheral circadian oscillators integrate circadian and other signals for different activity-related circadian rhythms. The hypothalamic structures implicated in regulation of behavioral and blood pressure rhythms belong to the circadian timing system since they underlie circadian rhythms diversity. The same hypothalamic areas selectively modulate circadian rhythms in response to homeostatic stimuli or stress without engaging the circadian oscillator.

TI  - Segregation analysis reveals a major gene effect controlling systolic blood pressure and BMI in an Israeli population.  
AB  - It has been suggested that genetic factors control blood pressure level at all ages. However, the evidence is limited because of the composite nature of blood pressure and the heterogeneity of the studied samples. The purpose of the present study is to test for genetic influences on systolic blood pressure (SBP) level in a community-based Israeli family study. Segregation analysis was performed on 622 adults from 208 pedigrees. Age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were significant covariates of SBP. Segregation analysis rejected the environmental transmission model but not the mixed Mendelian transmission model. The best-fitting genetic model was the mixed codominant model, with a heritability of 0.32 and an allele frequency of 0.18 for high SBP level. We further tested whether SBP and BMI shared a common major gene effect. Using bivariate segregation analysis involving two traits and a single locus, we found evidence for a single-locus pleiotropic effect on SBP and BMI. The allele frequency of this major locus was 0.24. The residual genetic correlation resulting from additive polygenes and the environmental correlation between these two traits were not different from zero after taking into account the shared major gene effect. The proportion of phenotypic variation attributable to this major gene effect increased with age for SBP but decreased with age for BMI.

TI  - Is low AT III a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease? Anecdotal observations.  
AB  - I report on my 6-year experience identifying the correlation of low antithrombin III (AT III) levels with coronary artery disease in a rural Missouri family practice setting. I measured plasma AT III levels in 78 patients who were at risk for coronary artery disease. I also tracked lipid profiles, HBA1C, blood pressure, body mass index, hostility, and nicotine use. I measured AT III levels using Baxter Diagnostic AG Dade antithrombin III chromogenic coagulation assays of antithrombin III (normal range, 88% to 126%) at the Boone County Hospital Laboratory, Columbia, Missouri. I analyzed the patient records and looked for the worst recording of each of the above risk factors, selecting the highest blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HBA1C, weight, and age. I selected the lowest AT III level, which often occurred when the patient was stressed. When the worst risk factors were picked over a long period of time, low AT III correlated with an arbitrary coronary artery disease scale 24% of the time. This negative correlation (r = -.49) was higher than any other risk factor in these selected patients.

TI  - Autonomic cardiac regulation in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: evidence from spontaneous baroreflex analysis during sleep.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess spontaneous baroreceptor-heart rate reflex sensitivity during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and characterized by marked sympathetic activation, which is believed to originate from hypoxic chemoreceptor stimulation, although little is known of other possible mechanisms such as baroreflex impairment. DESIGN AND METHODS: In 11 patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean+/-SD age 46.8+/-8.1 years, apnea/hypopnea index 67.9+/-19.1 h), who were normotensive or borderline hypertensive during wakefulness by clinic blood pressure measurements, finger blood pressure was monitored beat-by-beat non-invasively (Finapres) at night during polysomnography. Periods of wakefulness and sleep were identified based on electroencephalographic recordings. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by the sequence technique, as the slope of the regression line between spontaneous increases or reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the related lengthening or shortening in the RR interval, occurring over spontaneous sequences of four or more consecutive beats. The number of these sequences was also computed, as an additional index of baroreflex engagement by the spontaneous blood pressure fluctuations. The controls were age-related normotensive or borderline hypertensive subjects without sleep apnea who had been investigated in previous studies; in these subjects blood pressure was recorded intra-arterially over 24 h in ambulatory conditions and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by the sequence technique. RESULTS: In our patients the lowest nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation was 78.6+/-12.1% (mean+/-SD). During sleep, the number of pooled +RR/+SBP and -RR/-SBP sequences per hour was 20.3+/-2.7 per h in patients with sleep apnea and 27.1+/-2.1 /h in controls (means+/-SEM). The average baroreflex sensitivity during sleep periods was 7.04+/-0.8 ms/mmHg in sleep apnea patients and 10.05+/-2.1 ms/mmHg in controls. Both the pooled number of sequences and baroreflex sensitivity values of the sleep apnea patients were significantly (P < 0.01) less than the corresponding night values of control subjects. In the sleep apnea patients, at variance from controls, baroreflex sensitivity did not show any increase during sleep compared with its values during wakefulness (6.9+/-1.0 ms/mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that spontaneous baroceptor reflex sensitivity is depressed in severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This suggests that in such patients baroreflex dysfunction and not only chemoreceptor stimulation by hypoxia may be involved in the sympathetic activation which occurs during sleep. Such dysfunction may contribute to the higher rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality reported in these patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of verapamil SR 240 mg (V) and the combination amiloride 5 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg (AH) on diastolic dysfunction of hypertensive patients without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Twenty-six hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction, normal systolic function and without LVH were included into a 2-week washout period and then randomised to a 6-month V or AH treatment. One blinded-to-treatment echocardiographist at baseline and at weeks 4, 12 and 24 assessed Doppler-echocardiography. Both V and AH, satisfactorily controlled blood pressure, but only V improved diastolic function shown by a tendency to reduce peak A and to increase peak E/A ratio, and by a significant reduction in deceleration time. After 24 weeks, V significantly reduced wall thickness in comparison with AH. These results need to be confirmed in a larger scale study.

TI  - Effects of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone and in combination on blood pressure and heart rate in conscious-telemetered spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of combined administration of the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan, with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), on blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Both drugs were administered continuously via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps alone or in combination for a period of 2 weeks. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the infusion interval by means of chronically-implanted radiotransmitters. Coadministration of a diuretic with valsartan potentiated the blood pressure lowering effect in conscious SHR. Responses varied in magnitude from additive (valsartan at 1 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day) to synergistic (valsartan at 3 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 10 mg/kg/day). The greater blood pressure lowering seen in SHR receiving combination therapy was associated with only a transient increase in heart rate. A similar potentiation of the antihypertensive effect was seen during coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazeprilat. Additivity was noted with benazeprilat at 1 mg/kg/day + hydrochlorothiazide at 3 mg/kg/day, whereas a higher dose of HCTZ resulted in a synergistic response. These findings suggest that the similar results obtained with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists are due to the capacity to which diuretic-induced activation of the renin angiotensin system occurs.

TI  - The dose-response effects of terbutaline on the variability, approximate entropy and fractal dimension of heart rate and blood pressure.  
AB  - AIMS: To study the dose-response effects of intravenous terbutaline on the cardiovascular and respiratory autonomic nervous regulation. METHODS: The study followed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design in six healthy adult volunteers. The terbutaline dose ranged from 10 to 30 microg min(-1) We continuously measured electrocardiogram, finger systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and flow-volume spirometry in supine and upright positions at baseline and during 3 h drug infusion. The periodic variability components of R-R intervals (time between successive heart beats) and SAP in relation to respiration were assessed using spectral analysis techniques. The regularity of the time series was assessed by approximate entropy (ApEn) and the convolutedness by fractal dimension (FD). RESULTS: Terbutaline dose-dependently decreased total variability of R-R intervals, low frequency (LF) variability of R-R intervals (10 s waves), high frequency (HF) variability of R-R intervals (respiratory variability), total variability of SAP, HF variability of SAP, baroreflex sensitivity, plasma potassium concentration, approximate entropy of R-R interval and of SAP as well as fractal dimension of R-R interval. Terbutaline dose-dependently increased heart rate, LF/HF ratios of R-R intervals and of SAP, LF variability of SAP, minute ventilation and plasma terbutaline concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Terbutaline infusion decreases parasympathetic cardiovascular reactivity, baroreflex sensitivity, dimensionality of heart rate and plasma potassium concentration; it increases sympathetic dominance in cardiovascular autonomic balance, minute ventilation, and the regularity of heart rate and blood pressure time series.

TI  - Percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol replacement therapy in hypertensive postmenopausal women.  
AB  - The present study evaluated the short-term effects of percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol on blood pressure, metabolic profile and hormonal levels in postmenopausal women with systemic arterial hypertension. After a wash-out period of 15 days, 10 hypertensive patients were treated with guanabenz acetate to control blood pressure, followed by 17 beta-estradiol in the form of hydroalcoholic gel administered for 21 of 28 days of each cycle, for 3 cycles. Patients were evaluated before, during and 2 months after estrogen administration. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure or heart rate did not present any significant change in any patient when compared to those periods with the antihypertensive drug only (pretreatment period and 60 days after estrogen therapy was discontinued). Plasma biological markers of hepatic estrogenic action (plasma renin activity, antithrombin III, triglycerides, total cholesterol and lipoproteins) also remained unchanged during the study. Hormone treatment was effective, as indicated by the relief of menopausal symptoms, a decrease in FSH levels (73.48 +/- 27.21 to 35.09 +/- 20.44 IU/l, P < 0.05), and an increase in estradiol levels (15.06 +/- 8.76 to 78.7 +/- 44.6 pg/ml, P < 0.05). There was no effect on LH (18.0 +/- 9.5 to 14.05 +/- 8.28 IU/l). Hormone levels returned to previous values after estrogen treatment was discontinued. The data indicate that short-term percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol replacement therapy, at the dose used, seems to be a safe hormone therapy for hypertensive menopausal women. Nevertheless, a controlled, prospective, randomized clinical assay with a larger number of subjects is needed to definitely establish both the beneficial and harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy in hypertensive women.

AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) on plasma arginine vasopressin concentration (pAVP) in preterm neonates. METHODS: Thirty five neonates were classified, at the time of blood sampling, into three groups: unstable ventilated; stable ventilated; and stable non-ventilated. A modification of an extraction method for pAVP was developed for use in studies on very small babies, and sampling methods were compared. RESULTS: The pAVP (median, range) was similar in the ventilated (1.85 pmol/l, 0.5 to 3.4) and non-ventilated (2.0, 0.5 to 2.6) stable babies, but was significantly higher (5.7, 1.1 to 25) in the unstable group. There was an inverse correlation between systolic blood pressure and pAVP concentration. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in preterm neonates pAVP concentration is affected by the clinical condition and blood pressure, but not by treatment with IPPV.

TI  - Acute hypertension promotes hemorrhagic transformation in a rabbit embolic stroke model: effect of labetalol.  
AB  - We examined the relationship between acute hypertension following cerebral embolization and subsequent hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in a rabbit embolic stroke model. We have shown previously that the likelihood and severity of hemorrhage were significantly correlated with the magnitude of an acute hypertensive response to embolization. It was not clear, however, whether hypertension actually caused hemorrhage or was merely a marker of more severe stroke. In the current studies, we attempted to clarify the relationship between acute hypertension and HT by either pharmacologically inducing or attenuating the brief hypertensive response to embolization in rabbits. Under halothane anesthesia, two catheters were implanted in the right carotid arteries of male New Zealand white rabbits, one oriented toward the heart and one toward the brain. The animals were allowed to awaken and were embolized using blood clot emboli injected into the middle cerebral artery.  Blood pressure was monitored via the second carotid catheter. In the first experiment, hypertension was induced with angiotensin II, administered at the time of embolization or 1 h later. In the second experiment, we attempted to attenuate the hypertensive response using intravenous labetalol. The animals were sacrificed 18 h after embolization and the brains evaluated for hemorrhage. In the first experiment, administration of angiotensin II immediately after embolization did not increase the hypertensive response to embolization further than that spontaneously occurring, and no angiotensin II-related HT was observed. In contrast, an additional angiotensin-II-induced hypertensive episode 1 h after embolization significantly increased the number of 5-mm serial brain sections displaying HT, from 3.0 +/- .3 (mean +/- SE) in Controls to 5.4 +/- .8 in treated animals. In the second experiment, administration of labetalol (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of brain sections with visible HT, from 3.2 +/- .5 in controls to 1.6 +/- .4 in treated animals. Acute hypertension during the first hour after cerebral embolization promotes HT in this rabbit embolic stroke model. Labetalol prevents blood pressure elevation and reduces the extent of HT in the same model.

TI  - Hormone therapy in women in the menopause transition. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of effects on body weight, blood pressure, lipoprotein levels, antithrombin III activity, and the endometrium.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone treatment of women during the menopause transition induces changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipoprotein levels, antithrombin III activity, and the endometrium. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-month study, with crossover at 6 months. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a city hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 105 apparently healthy women in the menopause transition (40-52 years), with menstrual function, who were experiencing minor menopausal symptoms, were selected from the general population by advertising. INTERVENTIONS: Active arm--oral conjugated oestrogens (0.625 mg daily) and cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg daily) on Day 14-27 of each menstrual cycle; placebo arm--placebos of both medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Excess change from baseline associated with active compared with placebo treatment for all variables; effect of order of treatment. RESULTS: Baseline biochemical values were similar for both treatment-order groups, but baseline blood pressures and body weights were higher in the group receiving placebo first. With treatment, there were no differences in overall values for body weight and blood pressure (P > 0.4), and order of treatment had no significant influence (P > 0.3). There were no differences in total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, overall or with order of treatment. Active treatment increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (overall and when placebo was given first; P = 0.001), and triglyceride levels (when active treatment was given first; P = 0.03). There was no overall treatment effect, but a significant order-of-treatment effect, on antithrombin III activity (mean levels were decreased by active treatment to a greater extent when it was given first; P = 0.02). The endometrium showed only physiological changes regardless of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant excess change in anthropometry, lipoprotein levels, antithrombin III activity, and endometrial histology in women given hormone treatment compared with placebo is reassuring. The increase in HDL cholesterol level is an extra benefit. Our study provides conclusive evidence that hormone treatment does not produce weight gain in women during the menopause transition.

AB  - The relation between blood pressure and skeletal muscle magnesium and potassium, and the relation between these electrolytes and body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were studied in 29 hypertensive and 21 normotensive men. In addition, a comparison was made between the normotensive men and 37 normotensive women regarding the concentrations of muscle potassium and magnesium. Mean skeletal muscle potassium concentration was lower and plasma insulin higher in hypertensive compared to normotensives. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were inversely correlated to muscle potassium and positively correlated to insulin. Muscle magnesium was positively correlated to muscle potassium but not to blood pressure. Muscle magnesium was significantly higher in normotensive women, compared to normotensive men. Muscle potassium did not differ between the genders.

AB  - The antihypertensive effects and tolerance of once-daily barnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were evaluated. A total of 190 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-114 mmHg were investigated in this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. After a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to placebo or barnidipine (10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg modified release capsules) once daily for 6 weeks. Nonresponders (sitting DBP > or =90 mmHg and a decrease of < 10 mmHg) were treated for an additional 6 weeks with a dose increase of 10 mg. At each clinic visit, sitting and standing blood pressure and heart rate were measured approximately 24 hours after the last dose of study drug was taken. Compared with placebo, barnidipine lowered blood pressure, with a trend toward a dose-response relationship over the dose range 10-30 mg. A dose increment of 10 mg in nonresponders resulted in additional reductions in blood pressure. At the end of the active treatment period, the responder rates were 41% and 57% for 10 mg and 20 mg barnidipine, respectively. Heart rate in both sitting and standing positions was not affected by barnidipine. Treatment with barnidipine was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was dose related and consistent with vasodilatation. In conclusion, barnidipine (10-30 mg) administered once daily is well tolerated and reduces blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Orthostatic blood pressure decline in patients with this disease was significantly marked in comparison with that in 50 patients with lacunar infarction, especially in the males. This blood pressure decline was significant in patients with dementia and moderate or severe gait disturbance, compared with those without such symptoms. There was no difference in orthostatic change between patients suffering from this disease with non-dementia and mild or absent gait disturbance and those with only lacunar infarction. Orthostatic blood pressure decline was found to be correlated significantly with the disorder of nocturnal blood pressure decrease. It is suggested that the decline of blood pressure on standing is a parameter indicating the progression of this disease.

TI  - Contribution of parental blood pressures to association between low birth weight and adult high blood pressure: cross sectional study [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that low birth weight is a feature of the inherited predisposition to high blood pressure. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: Primary care medical centre in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS: One offspring of 452 families (231 men and 221 women aged 16-26 years) in whom blood pressure, weight, and height were measured in 1986 and whose parents had blood pressure measured in 1979. Birth weights were obtained from case records (270 offspring) or by questionnaires sent to the mothers (182 offspring). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth weight and adult systolic blood pressure in offspring in relation to parental blood pressure. RESULTS: If parental blood pressures were not considered, a 1 kg decrease in birth weight was associated with a 2.24 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure of offspring (P = 0.06) after correction for current weight and sex. However, parental blood pressures correlated positively with blood pressure of offspring, and higher maternal blood pressure was associated with lower birth weight (-3.03 g/mm Hg, P < 0.01). After correction for parental blood pressures, a 1 kg decrease in birth weight was associated with only a 1.71 mm Hg increase in the systolic blood pressure of the offspring (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Low birth weight is a feature of the inherited predisposition to hypertension, perhaps because it is associated with higher maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. Parental blood pressure may be an important confounding factor in the relation between low birth weight and subsequent hypertension.

TI  - A population-based study of the white-coat blood pressure effect: positive correlation with plasma cortisol.  
AB  - We aimed to study the white-coat effect (WCE) of clinic blood pressure (BP) and its relation to plasma cortisol, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and demographic variables. Henry et al. have earlier suggested two stress-reaction patterns. The "defeat reaction" mainly involves the cortisol-axis and the "fight-flight-response" is mediated by the sympathoadrenal-system. Ninety-one men and 88 women 20-70 years of age, randomly selected from the population were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Clinic BP, plasma cortisol and plasma NPY (both analysed by radio-immunoassay) were obtained at 0800 h and 24h ambulatory BP (ABP) was performed. WCE was defined as supine clinic BP - mean daytime ABP. Cortisol correlated to the systolic WCE in the total material* (r = 0.22, p = 0.005) and in men 45-70 years of age (r = 0.45, p = 0.002, n = 47) and to diastolic WCE in women 45-70 years of age* (r = 0.37, p = 0.02, n = 38). (*women treated with oestrogens, or being pregnant, excluded, n = 21). Only in women did NPY correlate weakly to the systolic WCE (r = 0.22, p = 0.044). Subjects with one or more first degree hypertensive relative had a more marked systolic WCE than those without (-0.02 +/- 10 mmHg and -4.1 +/- 9.3 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.01). In conclusion cortisol correlated stronger to the WCE than did NPY. This would suggest the WCE to be a defeat reaction rather than a fight-flight-response.

TI  - Undertreatment of hypertension in older Mexican Americans.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of hypertension and factors associated with nontreatment and poor control of hypertension in Mexican Americans aged 65 years and older. DESIGN: A population-based survey of older Mexican Americans conducted in 1993-1994. SETTING: Subjects residing in five Southwestern states: Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. PARTICIPANTS: An area probability sample of 3050 noninstitutionalized Mexican American men and women aged 65 and older took part in a 90-minute in-home interview, which included review of all medications taken and two sitting blood pressure measurements. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measured were previous diagnoses of hypertension, current medication for hypertension, and current blood pressure RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of older Mexican-Americans were hypertensive, and 51% of those with hypertension were taking antihypertensive medications. Only 25% of hypertensive subjects (18% of males and 30% of females) were in good blood pressure control (i.e., systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). In multivariate analyses, factors associated with increased likelihood of treatment included female gender (OR = 1.9), history of heart disease (OR = 2.4), possessing a regular source of health care (OR = 2.7), and having seen a physician two or more times in the previous year (OR = 3.8). These were also independent predictors of good blood pressure control. CONCLUSION: Nontreatment of hypertension is still a major public health concern in older Mexican Americans. We estimate that adequate blood pressure control in this population would prevent approximately 30,000 adverse cardiovascular events over 10 years, affecting approximately 6% of the entire Mexican American older population.

TI  - The clinical utility of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring in psychiatric inpatients.  
AB  - Alterations in heart rate and blood pressure (BP) may occur in patients receiving psychiatric medication.  Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was compared with nurses' conventional vital signs (CVS) for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) and heart rate (HR) measurements in psychiatric inpatients receiving multidrug treatments. Twelve consecutive subjects were enrolled. ABP monitoring and CVS measurements were concurrent but independent in each subject. Ambulatory BP monitoring recorded SBP, DBP, and HR thrice hourly from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM and once hourly between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM; CVS were obtained an average of 3.6 times/24 h. The frequency with which each BP and HR measurement method detected Level-1 (SBP 90 to 100 or 180 to 209 mm Hg; DBP 40 to 60 or 110 to 119 mm Hg; HR 50 to 60 or 110 to 119 beats/min) or Level-2 (SBP < 90 or > or = 210 mm Hg; DBP < 40 or > or = 120 mm Hg; HR < 50 or > or = 120 beats/min) events was determined, and disagreements between the two measurement systems were analyzed using the McNemar test for paired sample data. Ambulatory BP monitoring detected significantly more Level-1 and Level-2 events than CVS. A significant number of mostly low BP were documented by ABP monitoring and were undetected by the CVS obtained by the nursing staff. This finding may be of clinical relevance in view of the potential hemodynamic consequences of hypotension, especially in older patients receiving psychotropic multidrug treatment.

TI  - The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on myocardial function and blood pressure after coronary artery bypass surgery--a randomised study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 6 weeks' pre-operative treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, on left ventricular function when measured 3 months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and to examine the safety of such treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (96) [86 males, 10 females; mean age 61 years] with chronic stable angina, on the waiting list for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, underwent measurement of left ventricular function by resting radionuclide ventriculography. Patients were then randomised to quinapril 20 mg once daily or placebo in a double-blind fashion, in addition to existing anti-anginal therapy and this regimen was continued for up to 6 weeks prior to operation. Measurement of left ventricular function was repeated 3 months following surgery, after recommencement of pre-surgery anti-anginal therapy for 1 week. Effects on systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during bypass were calculated from perfusion records and vasoconstrictor use during operation was documented. The safety of the addition of quinapril to the anti-anginal regimen was assessed by measurement of systemic blood pressure (BP) after the first dose of study medication, measurement of intra-operative BP, administration of inotropes and any intra-operative complications. RESULTS: There was no difference between treatment groups in the pre-study left ventricular ejection fraction (mean (S.D.); 54.9 (13.8)% versus 55.6 (13.2)%, quinapril versus placebo, respectively), or 3 months after surgery (58.1 (13.6)%, versus 56.9 (12.6)%, quinapril versus placebo, respectively). Left ventricular ejection fraction 3 months after surgery did not change significantly from pre-treatment in either group (2.8 (10.7)% and 1.5 (10.1)%; quinapril and placebo, respectively). There was no first-dose hypotension (systolic BP < 100 mmHg). The intra-operative BP and the SVR during bypass in the two treatment groups were not significantly different. The ischaemic time (mean = 56 min) and the use of inotropes were the same in both groups and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment before coronary artery bypass graft surgery does not have a significant beneficial effect on left ventricular function following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, administered in addition to anti-anginal therapy, does not cause first-dose hypotension or increase morbidity or mortality and can safely be used in patients with coronary heart disease prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

TI  - Compliance, electronic monitoring and antihypertensive drugs.  
AB  - Hypertension, even of mild-to-moderate severity, is undoubtedly a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It has been well demonstrated, in numerous studies that have been subjected to meta-analysis, that the introduction of antihypertensive treatment leads to reductions in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. These results can be obtained with even a moderate reduction in blood pressure, of the order of 4-5 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. However, many studies have shown that the percentage of treated hypertensive individuals who have a reduction in blood pressure to normal values of systolic blood pressure/ diastolic blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) is of the order of 30%. The reduction in blood pressure data are well correlated with the level of compliance. This compliance can be defined as the adherence by the patient to the directions given by the doctor for medication dosage, and this can be considered as 'good' when it is of the order of 80%. Until recently the examination of compliance relied on questioning the patient, pill counts or ultimately blood sampling for drug levels, which could be used only in research. The use of an electronic pill box with a microprocessor in the cover that records the date and hour each time the box is opened is a precise method of recording compliance. The purpose of such a method is to study overall compliance, which deteriorates as time passes and falls by approximately 50% after 1 year. However, this compliance can be modified and improved if instruction and follow-up are given to the patient. Prescription compliance can be improved by once daily dosing and by instructing for this to be taken in the morning. In contrast compliance is considerably reduced when more than two doses are to be taken each day. Using the pill counting box allows us to describe and focus on different types of patients, ranging from rigidly adherent to completely chaotic. It seems that factors such as age and activity can influence these patterns of compliance.

TI  - Homocysteine and ischemic heart disease: results of a prospective study with implications regarding prevention [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from prospective studies of serum homocysteine levels and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are inconclusive. We carried out a further prospective study to help clarify the position. METHODS: In the British United Provident Association (BUPA) prospective study of 21,520 men aged 35 to 64 years, we measured homocysteine levels in stored serum samples and analyzed data from 229 men without a history of IHD at study entry who subsequently died of IHD and 1126 age-matched control subjects (nested case-control design). RESULTS: Serum homocysteine levels were significantly higher in men who died of IHD than in men who did not (mean, 13.1 vs 11.8 micromol/L; P<.001). The risk of IHD among men in the highest quartile of serum homocysteine levels was 3.7 times (or 2.9 times after adjusting for other risk factors) the risk among men in the lowest quartile (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-4.7). There was a continuous dose-response relationship, with risk increasing by 41% (95% CI, 20%-65%) for each 5-micromol/L increase in the serum homocysteine level. After adjustment for apolipoprotein B levels and blood pressure, this estimate was 33% (95% CI, 22%-59%). In a meta-analysis of the retrospective studies of homocysteine level and myocardial infarction, the age-adjusted association was stronger: an 84% (95% CI, 52%-123%) increase in risk for a 5-micromol/L increase in the homocysteine level, possibly because the participants were younger; the relationship between serum homocysteine level and IHD seems to be stronger in younger persons than in older persons. CONCLUSIONS: Our positive results help resolve the uncertainty that resulted from previous prospective studies. The epidemiological, genetic, and animal evidence together indicate that the association between serum homocysteine level and IHD is likely to be causal. A general increase in consumption of the vitamin folic acid (which reduces serum homocysteine levels) would, therefore, be expected to reduce mortality from IHD.

TI  - Seven-year incidence of hypertension in a cohort of middle-aged African Americans and whites.  
AB  - Many studies have suggested that African Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension than whites. The authors conducted a prospective study of hypertension incidence from 1987-1988 to 1994-1995 in 140 African American and 237 white adults aged 30 to 54 years at baseline. The study participants were screened for participation in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, phase 1, an 18-month lifestyle modification intervention trial aimed at lowering blood pressure, at the Baltimore Clinical Center. Baseline age, blood pressure, body mass index, and heart rate were similar in the two groups. Compared with whites, however, African Americans had a lower percentage of men, college graduates, and households with an income > or = $40,000 per year. African Americans also had lower mean urinary sodium to creatinine ratio and potassium to creatinine ratio, but a similar sodium to potassium ratio. The incidence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 160/95 mm Hg and/or taking antihypertensive medication) over 7 years of follow-up was nearly identical: 25.7% in African Americans and 25.3% in whites. Baseline age, gender, blood pressure, and heart rate were all associated with the incidence of hypertension. Even after adjustment for these covariables, the risk of hypertension was not higher in African Americans compared with whites. These results indicate that middle-aged African Americans and whites have a similar risk of developing hypertension given the same age, initial blood pressure, and body mass index at baseline.

TI  - Genetic analysis of the SA and Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 genes in the Milan hypertensive rat.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether the SA gene locus (on rat chromosome 1) and the sodium potassium ATPase alpha1 gene locus (on rat chromosome 2) contribute to the elevated blood pressure in the Milan hypertensive rat. DESIGN: Co-segregation analysis using polymorphisms in the SA and Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 genes in F2 rats from a cross of Milan hypertensive and Milan normotensive rats. Analysis of SA and N+/K+-ATPase alpha1 gene expression in kidneys of 6 and 25 weeks old Milan hypertensive and normotensive rats. METHODS: Genotyping of F2 rat DNA by restriction digestion and Southern blotting and comparison of messenger RNA levels by northern blot analysis. RESULTS: Renal expression of SA was considerably higher in normotensive than it was in hypertensive rats aged 6 and 25 weeks. Despite this difference the SA genotype did not co-segregate with blood pressure, although the Milan hypertensive rat allele did co-segregate with greater body weight (P = 0.0014) for male F2 rats. Expression of Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 was higher in the kidneys of young hypertensive rats than it was in those of normotensive rats and did not decline with age as occurred in the normotensive rats. However, again the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 genotype did not co-segregate with blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in the patterns of expression of SA and Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 genes in the kidneys of Milan hypertensive and normotensive rats, we found no evidence of co-segregation of either gene with blood pressure. Our results suggest that either SA is simply acting as marker for a linked gene in other crosses for which co-segregation with blood pressure has been observed, or at least, the level of its renal expression is not the sole determinant of its effect on blood pressure. The failure of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha1 gene to co-segregate with blood pressure suggests that its greater expression in the kidney of the Milan hypertensive rat is either reactive or controlled by other genetic loci.

TI  - Clinical presentation of women readmitted with postpartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify symptoms that prompted a group of women readmitted for postpartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia to seek medical care. DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control. SETTING: Tertiary-care teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: The study group consisted of 53 women readmitted in the postpartum period with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. The control group was matched two-to-one with an index study participant and consisted of 106 women who had intrapartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient symptoms, physical findings, laboratory assays. RESULTS: Neurologic complaints, malaise, and nausea and vomiting were reported more often in women who were readmitted than in mothers with intrapartum preeclampsia (all p values less than .001). Headaches were positively correlated with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure in women who were readmitted (all p values less than .05), although there was no relationship between blood pressure and headaches in the control group. In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that study participants were more likely to deliver at full term, have headaches and malaise, have normal platelet values, and develop seizures than mothers in the control group, chi 2 = 155.7, p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: Women readmitted for postpartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia have a clinical presentation that differs from that of intrapartum preeclampsia or eclampsia.

TI  - The conjoint trait of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides in adolescent black and white males.  
AB  - To evaluate the interrelationships among body composition, blood pressure, and lipid phenotypes in adolescent black and white boys, we assessed racial distributions of lipids, blood pressure, and obesity and their joint occurrence in black and white boys aged 10 to 15 years. Subjects were recruited from Cincinnati (OH) schools. Because the differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) are the most profound coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor differences between black and white males, we assigned subjects to one of four low-HDL-C and high-TG categories (normal and increased risk) using the age/race-specific 25th (HDL-C) and 75th (TG) percentiles. We then assessed racial distributions of lipids, blood pressure, and obesity by these phenotypes. Age differences between the black and white participants were significant, with the former about 3 months younger (P=.03), but black boys were more mature and were significantly taller and heavier and had a greater body mass index ([BMI] weight in kilograms divided by height in centimeters squared). Differences in the sum of the triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds were not significant. Blacks had significantly higher HDL-C, lower TG, and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) were not significant. In both racial groups, the body composition measures were significantly correlated with HDL-C, TG, and blood pressure levels; the correlations between HDL-C and both weight and BMI were significantly stronger in white boys. The proportion of boys of each race with low HDL-C and high TG was similar by design. In both racial groups, subjects with the conjoint trait had a significantly greater BMI, triceps skinfold, and sum of skinfolds than subjects in the other phenotypic groups. For white boys, participants with the conjoint trait had the highest SBP and DBP; differences in SBP were significant for comparisons to the normal- and high-TG group alone, and differences in DBP were significant for the comparison between normal and low HDL-C alone. For black boys, subjects with both normal HDL-C and TG had significantly lower SBP than boys with either the conjoint trait or high TG alone; none of the group differences in DBP were significant. Black had significantly less dense LDL (more LDL-C per apolipoprotein [apo] B). In each racial group, boys with the conjoint trait had the most dense LDL, significantly more dense than in any of the other phenotypes in black boys and significantly more dense than in boys with low HDL-C alone and normal boys in the white group. In both racial groups, the occurrence of no risk factors (>75th percentile TG, BMI, SBP, and DBP or <25th percentile HDL-C) and three or more risk factors was greater than expected by chance alone, and the occurrence of exactly one risk factor and two factors was less. When examined by phenotypic groups within race, boys in each racial group with the normal phenotype had a greater than expected percentage with no risk factors, and white boys with the conjoint trait were more likely to have a marked increase in multiple risk factors. Possible mechanisms for this clustering of risk factors and for the racial differences in the patterns are discussed.

TI  - The effect of metabolic control on rate of decline in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with overt diabetic nephropathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strict glycaemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. In established nephropathy, however, the impact of glycaemic control on prognosis is less clear. Therefore we investigated the effect of long-term glycaemic control on the decline in renal function in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with overt nephropathy. METHODS: The study was performed at two hospital-based diabetes centres in western Sweden. The study was an observational retrospective follow-up study in 158 insulin-dependent diabetics with proteinuria with a mean (+/-SD) age of 36+/-9 years and a diabetes duration of 22+/-8 years. The change in glomerular filtration rate was measured as 51Cr EDTA clearance for a median of 8 years (range 1-17). Glycaemic control was determined with measurements of glycated haemoglobin A1c. RESULTS: The decline in glomerular filtration rate was 3.8+/-3.7 ml/min/year. The blood pressure was 143/82+/-15/7 mmHg and the mean glycated haemoglobin was 8.7+/-1.6%. The correlation coefficient between glycated haemoglobin and decline in glomerular filtration rate was -0.39 (P<0.0001 ) and between decline in glomerular filtration rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure -0.17 (P=0.03) and -0.29 (P=0.003) respectively. In patients with glycated haemoglobin <8.0% and diastolic blood pressure <85 mmHg the decline in glomerular filtration rate was 1.7+/-2.3 ml/min/year. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective observational study, effective blood-pressure control was associated with a low rate of decline in renal function and a low urinary albumin excretion. The correlation between glycaemic control and decline in renal function indicates that poor glycaemic control can accelerate the loss of renal function in diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure reduction and plasma catecholamines.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Controversial data have been reported on plasma catecholamines in hypertensives. Aims of this study were to find whether 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was correlated with circulating catecholamines and to investigate whether nocturnal blood pressure reduction was associated with baseline plasma catecholamines. Samples for catecholamine determination were obtained in 34 consecutive male subjects after a 30-minute rest and before ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Hypertensive patients (n = 22; 24-hour blood pressure: 145 +/- 14/94 +/- 6 mm Hg) showed similar norepinephrine and epinephrine levels when compared with normotensives (n = 12; 24-hour blood pressure: 124 +/- 6/81 +/- 6 mm Hg), and higher dopamine values (hypertensives: 64.6 +/- 58; normotensives: 26.2 +/- 31 pg/ml; p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between dopamine and diastolic nocturnal blood pressure (p < 0.05) while a negative correlation was found between dopamine and nocturnal diastolic blood pressure reduction (p < 0.025). No significant relationship was observed between both norepinephrine and epinephrine, and 24-hour blood pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Since previous reports have documented malfunctioning of dopaminergic system in hypertension, the higher levels of circulating plasma dopamine found in hypertensive patients in the present study may account for a peripheral compensatory increase. The correlation between dopamine and nocturnal blood pressure fall seems to indicate that the impairment of dopaminergic system may influence the 24-hour blood pressure profile, affecting the nocturnal blood pressure reduction.

TI  - Effects of L-NAME on cerebral metabolic, vasopressin, oxytocin, and blood pressure responses in hemorrhaged rats.  
AB  - NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 250 micrograms/5 microliters), an inhibitor of NO synthase, or the vehicle artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 5 microliters) was administered intracerebroventricularly to conscious rats hemorrhaged (0.7 ml/min) to a 20% volume depletion. Hypotension was maximal 5 min after hemorrhage ended, with compensatory recovery to basal levels 20 min later, regardless of drug treatment. L-NAME, however, elevated (P < 0.05) blood pressure (vs. aCSF controls) 40-45 min after intracerebroventricular administration. In normovolemic rats, L-NAME produced a significant pressor response and increased plasma levels of vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT). After hemorrhage, both hormone levels increased, but only OT was further enhanced by L-NAME. Thus centrally produced NO tonically inhibits OT and VP secretion under basal normovolemic conditions and selectively inhibits OT release during hypovolemia. Hemorrhage increased the rates of glucose utilization in the neural lobe, indicative of enhanced efferent neural functional activity. L-NAME further enhanced the metabolic activity in the entire hypothalamoneurohypophysial system of hemorrhaged animals. Several other brain structures involved in the regulation of blood pressure and the stress response were also metabolically affected by the hemorrhage and L-NAME.

TI  - Comparison of the effect of latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5% on the calculated ocular perfusion pressure in patients with normal-tension glaucoma.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the calculated mean ocular perfusion pressure at the end of 3 weeks' treatment with latanoprost 0.005% once daily or timolol 0.5% twice daily in normal-tension glaucoma patients. METHODS: In a three-center, double-masked, randomized, crossover study, 36 patients were allocated to two treatment groups; one received 3 weeks each of placebo, latanoprost, placebo, and timolol, whereas the other group had placebo, timolol, placebo, and latanoprost. Intraocular pressure and resting systemic blood pressure were measured at 9 AM, 12 noon, and 4 PM. Ocular perfusion pressure was calculated for each time period as well as the mean of three values (daytime average). Systemic blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded at 30-minute intervals during the last 24 hours of each treatment period. RESULTS: The average daytime mean ocular perfusion pressure (mean +/- SEM) following latanoprost treatment was 53.2 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, an increase of 8% from the latanoprost run-in period, compared with 50.9 +/- 1.1 mm Hg following timolol treatment, an increase of 2% from the timolol run-in period (P < .05, ANOVA). Timolol reduced the blood pressure. The difference in mean daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure measurements as well as nighttime diastolic blood pressure was about 5 mm Hg between the latanoprost and timolol treatments. The daytime and nighttime heart rates were also slower during the timolol treatment. CONCLUSION: Because ocular perfusion pressure may be important in some glaucomatous patients, latanoprost appears to affect ocular perfusion pressure more favorably than timolol does in patients with normal-tension glaucoma.

TI  - Comparison of the effects and disposition kinetics of articaine and lidocaine in 20 patients undergoing intravenous regional anaesthesia during day case surgery.  
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to assess the effects and disposition kinetics of the local anaesthetic drugs (+/-) articaine and lidocaine during intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA). The mean onset time of surgical analgesia of articaine was 2.5 +/- 1.1 min and that of lidocaine 11.2 +/- 5.1 min (p = 0.0006). None of the patients exhibited objective symptoms of toxicity, either local or systemic, during injection of articaine or lidocaine, nor were there any subjective complaints. No changes in blood pressure, heart rate or oxygen saturation were observed with these local anesthetics at any time during the procedure, nor after deflation of the tourniquet. After releasing the tourniquet, articaine appears in the blood and is rapidly eliminated with a t1/2 alpha of 5 +/- 3 min and a t1/2 beta of 59 +/- 39 min due to hydrolysis. Lidocaine is rapidly and biexponentially eliminated with similar half-lives of t1/2 alpha of 4 +/- 2 min and a t1/2 beta of 79 +/- 31 min. Total body clearance of articaine (8.9 +/- 3.5 L/min) is ten times greater than that of lidocaine (0.9 +/- 0.4 L/min; p = 0.0005). We concluded that both (+/-) articaine and lidocaine are suitable and safe agents for IVRA with rapid onset of good surgical anaesthesia. Articaine is a racemic mixture, which is nowadays considered as less favourable. After releasing the tourniquet, articaine is eliminated with a t1/2 beta of 60 min and lidocaine with a t1/2 beta of 80 min. Quicker onset and shorter elimination time favours (+/-) articaine over lidocaine for IVRA in day case settings so that patients treated with articaine will be 'drug free' more quickly than those who receive lidocaine. Faster elimination and more rapid onset are important advantages for articaine in IVRA for day-case procedures.

TI  - The effect of surgical treatment on secondary hyperaldosteronism and relative hyperinsulinemia in primary hyperparathyroidism.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the renin-aldosterone system and insulin secretion in hyperparathyroidism and their effects on blood pressure regulation. DESIGN: Studies were carried out on patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) prior to and following removal of the parathyroid tumor. METHODS: Sixteen normotensive and euglycemic patients with PHPT were studied. The following parameters were measured: basal and stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (ALD) secretion: parathormone (PTH) and serum electrolytes. Insulin and glucose levels were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Systolic but not diastolic blood pressure showed a decrease following surgery, from 123.3+/-13.0/80+/-8.6 to 116.7+/-13.5/77.3+/-8.8 mmHg. The decrease in the systolic pressure was not clinically significant. After surgery, both the basal and stimulated PRA and ALD values decreased, and the preoperative pathological values returned to normal: PRA basal: 1.79 --> 0.70 ng/ml/h, P=0.0049; PRA stimulated: 7.76 --> 1.90 ng/ml/h, P=0.0031; ALD basal: 111.5 --> 73.0 pg/ml, P=0.0258; ALD stimulated: 392.5 --> 236.0 pg/ml, P=0.0157. The postoperative decrease in the PRA correlated with the changes in PTH levels (r=0.5442, P < 0.05, n=16) but did not correlate with the changes in serum calcium concentrations. Both the fasting and stimulated insulin levels decreased after surgery but remained within the normal range: insulin fasting: 10.2 --> 5.0 mIU/l, P=0.0218; insulin area under the curve: 5555 --> 3296 mIU/l*min, P=0.0218. There was no correlation between the changes in insulin levels and PTH or ion levels. Sodium, potassium and blood glucose levels remained unaffected by parathyroid surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of normotensive hyperparathyroid patients an increased activity of the renin-aldosterone system related to PTH was found and surgery resulted in a small and insignificant decrease in blood pressure. This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the activity of the renin-aldosterone system indicating the role of the renin-aldosterone system in the regulation of blood pressure in PHPT. Both fasting and stimulated insulin values decreased following removal of the parathyroid tumor, but with no individual correlation with PTH and calcium levels.

TI  - Are insulin metabolism and night-time blood pressure related to left ventricular hypertrophy?  
AB  - Essential hypertensives in whom blood pressure does not fall during sleep (non-dippers) are thought to be at greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity. Insulin resistance is also suggested to be a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of insulin metabolism to left ventricular hypertrophy in dippers and non-dippers. Thirty male, non-diabetic out-patients with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension were included in the study: 21 dippers (mean age 45+/-13 years; body mass index 28.2+/-4.0 kg/m2) and nine non-dippers (mean age 48+/-10 years, body mass index 28.6+/-3.9 kg/m2). Patients were subdivided into dippers and non-dippers on the basis of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Insulin and glucose responses to an oral glucose load have been evaluated. C-peptide levels were determined. Left ventricular mass was assessed by echocardiography. Non-dippers had significantly higher mean night-time systolic (non-dippers: 148+/-9; dippers: 123+/-16 mmHg; P<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (non-dippers: 90+/-8; dippers: 77+/-8 mmHg; P<0.001) and non-significantly higher left ventricular mass (279+/-92 g) and left ventricular mass index (135+/-46 g/m2). No significant difference was found between C-peptide, insulin, glucose levels and incremental areas between the two groups. Night-time blood pressure, insulin, C-peptide and glucose did not correlate with left ventricular mass in non-dippers. Dippers showed a positive correlation between fasting C-peptide and left ventricular mass (r=0.48, P=0.02) and between glucose and left ventricular mass (r=0.42, P=0.05). Our data indicate that night-time blood pressure and insulin are not related to left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension.

TI  - Hypertension and the eye: applications of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, kidney disease, and stroke. More people are aware of treating and controlling their blood pressure, but overall control rates are low and the incidence of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality remains high. METHODS: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute released The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) as the most recent national guideline to hypertension control for primary care clinicians. RESULTS: JNC VI identifies 10 hypertension-related public health challenges: (1) prevent the rise of blood pressure; (2) decrease prevalence of hypertension; (3) increase awareness and detection of hypertension; (4) improve control of hypertension; (5) reduce cardiovascular risks; (6) increase recognition of importance of isolated systolic hypertension; (7) improve recognition of importance of high-normal blood pressure; (8) reduce ethnic, socioeconomic, and regional variations; (9) improve treatment; and (10) enhance community programs. CONCLUSIONS: The eye is a target organ and retinopathy is a frequent complication--as well as a prognostic indicator--of sustained hypertension. As part of a multidisciplinary team approach, the optometrist assumes a significant role in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure and its associated morbidities.

TI  - The generalizability of cardiovascular responses across settings.  
AB  - The generalizability of cardiovascular reactivity change scores remains largely unsupported. In previous studies, several factors differed between laboratory and field, making poor lab-to-life correlations difficult to interpret. The present study varied only one parameter between the lab and field: setting. In this study, 24 females were studied on four occasions: twice in the lab (to provide test-retest reliability); once in a classroom; and once at home. After a baseline, subjects performed a math task, while blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Procedures were identical in all sessions. Blood pressure changes were fairly reliable between the two lab sessions, with rs values 0.68 (systolic) and 0.62 (diastolic pressure); however, lab/nonlab correlations were lower (0.47 for SBP; 0.38 for DBP). This suggests that even a minor variation in procedure, such as a change in setting, can affect generalizability; other lab-field differences may have an even greater impact.

TI  - Local cerebral blood flow autoregulation following "asymptomatic" cerebral venous occlusion in the rat.  
AB  - OBJECT: Maintenance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation in the brain is of major importance for patient outcome in various clinical conditions. The authors assessed local autoregulation after "asymptomatic" cortical vein occlusion. METHODS: In Wistar rats, a single cortical vein was occluded photochemically by using rose bengal and fiberoptic illumination. In rats with bilateral carotid artery occlusion, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was lowered in 5-mm Hg increments down to 40 mm Hg by using hypobaric hypotension. Local CBF at each pressure level was assessed by performing laser Doppler (LD) scanning at 25 (5 x 5) locations within bilateral cranial windows. In this manner, the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) was detected. The LLA was 60 mm Hg in both right and left hemispheres in Group A (five rats), in which the animals received illumination without rose bengal and had no venous occlusion. Of the 11 rats that underwent vein occlusion, three developed severe reductions in local CBF and/or a growing venous thrombus and were distinguished as Group C (symptomatic; three rats); from previous work we know that those animals are bound to experience venous infarction. The remaining rats formed Group B (asymptomatic; eight rats). In this group the LLA remained at 60 mm Hg in the left hemisphere without occlusion, whereas, in the right cortex with the occluded vein, the LLA was found to be 65 mm Hg. Below a carotid stump pressure of 25 mm Hg regional CBF in the affected hemisphere dropped more abruptly to a possibly ischemic range than that in the opposite normal hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that cerebral venous circulation disorders are manifested via additional pathways, that is, from a partially impaired local autoregulation in the vicinity of the occluded vein, even under conditions in which the vein occlusion itself does not cause brain damage. Care should be taken in the control of blood pressure in patients with this pathological condition.

TI  - Physicians' opinions about the management of hypertension: changes in Finland between 1985 and 1992.  
AB  - The successful management of hypertension requires an active involvement of physicians. We studied trends in Finnish physicians' opinions about the management of hypertension between 1985 and 1992. The response rates in these two random samples of physicians were 68% and 56%, respectively. Physicians who reported regularly treating hypertensive patients were included in our analyses (n1 = 319, n2 = 470). Fifty per cent of physicians used diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg as a criterion for starting drug treatment and a goal blood pressure of 90 mm Hg was reported by 60% of physicians. Both levels decreased from 1985 to 1992. The variation in both of these blood pressure levels as reported by the physicians were wide both in 1985 and 1992. The activity in promoting non-pharmacological measures such as exercise and restriction of fat intake improved during this time period. The choice of drugs for anti-hypertensive therapy changed drastically from 1985 to 1992. For younger patients ACE inhibitors became the drug of choice and for older patients Ca-blockers gained popularity from diuretics. A similar shift can also be seen in the sales statistics. Whether this increased activity in starting drug therapy and using new drugs will improve the outcome of treatment remains to be seen.

TI  - Ambulatory systolic blood pressure is related to the deletion allele of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene in young normotensives with parental history of hypertension.  
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and ambulatory blood pressure in young normotensive males with (n=45) and without (n=100) family history of hypertension. Twenty-four hour and daytime systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in subjects with a parental history of hypertension.  Ambulatory blood pressure values did not differ significantly across ACE genotypes in subjects with negative family history of hypertension. In subjects with a parental history of hypertension, there was a significant positive association between the D allele of the ACE gene polymorphism and 24-h, daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure. For twenty-four hour systolic blood pressure there was an average 9 mmHg difference between subjects with DD and II genotypes. The results indicate that in normotensive subjects with a genetic predisposition to hypertension, ambulatory systolic blood pressure is related to the D allele of the ACE gene.

TI  - Nocturnal blood pressure in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: correlation with cardiac function.  
AB  - Lack of a decline in nocturnal blood pressure is associated with an adverse effect on end organs in adults with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The role of the decline in nocturnal blood pressure in young patients with IDDM is not known. We studied 25 white subjects with IDDM (age = 20.8 +/- 3.7 years, mean +/- SD), 8 of whom were female. The duration of IDDM in these subjects was 12.9 +/- 5.4 years (mean +/- SD). We determined the values for glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, diastolic cardiac function (the ratio of peak E wave to peak A wave velocity (E/A) and indexed peak filling rate {PFR/SV} by Doppler echocardiography), and albumin excretion rate. The HgbA1 level was 10.9% +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SD; normal range = 4.5%-8.5%). The HgbA1 concentration was inversely correlated (p < 0.005) with the decline in systolic (r = 0.57) and diastolic (r = -0.55) nocturnal blood pressure. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction {E/A ratio [r = 0.42, p < 0.03) and PFR/SV (r = 0.52, p < 0.01)} correlated with a smaller decrease in nocturnal diastolic blood pressure. An inverse correlation between decline in nocturnal systolic blood pressure and log albumin excretion rate (r = -0.37, p = 0.07) approached statistical significance. We conclude that poor glycemic control adversely affects nocturnal blood pressure and that the latter may play an important role in cardiac and possibly renal dysfunction in early IDDM.

A 6-month-old girl presented with a huge abdominal mass and was found to have a hepatoblastoma that measured 15 x 10 x 12 cm and arose from the right lobe of her liver on computed tomography (CT) scan examination. The tumor spontaneously ruptured, and she went into shock. TAE with gelfoam cube particles successfully arrested the tumor bleeding and allowed stabilization of her blood pressure with blood transfusion. Right trisegmentectomy was performed 12 hours later. The postoperative course was uneventful. With three courses of cisplatin, vincristine, and 5-fluorouracil after the hepatectomy, the serum alpha-fetoprotein level returned to normal, and the patient has remained well 4 months postoperation.

TI  -  Blood pressure and coronary heart disease in NIDDM subjects at diagnosis: prevalence and risks in a Bangladeshi population.  
AB  - Overall obesity and central fat distribution are frequently accompanied by hyperglycemia, hypertension (HTN) and coronary heart disease (CHD) observed in developed nations and in South Asian migrants. This study attempts to estimate the prevalence of CHD and HTN and to assess the related risks among the newly diagnosed diabetics in the developing communities. From a total of 3583 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) subjects, the authors investigated 693 (M = 295, F = 398) randomly selected non-smokers of age 30-60 years. WHO diagnostic criteria were used for NIDDM and IGT. Systolic and diastolic hypertension (sHTN and dHTN) were defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 140 and diastolic (DBP) > or = 90 mmHg. Diagnosis of CHD was based on electrocardiogram either on rest or on stress or both when equivocal. The overall prevalence of CHD in the NIDDM subjects was 18.6%. The prevalence rates of sHTN and dHTN were 23.2 and 13.6%, respectively. CHD and HTN did not differ significantly between male and female and between urban and rural subjects. CHD prevalence was significantly higher in the higher tertiles of age, SBP and DBP (P < 0.001, for all cases). Logistic regression showed that only the increasing age, high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and high BP were the independent risks for CHD. For sHTN, the independent risks were increased age and high body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2). Regardless of sex and area, increased prevalence of CHD and HTN were found in the newly diagnosed diabetic subjects. Increased age, central obesity and HTN were the independent risks for CHD while advancing age and overall obesity was related to sHTN.

TI  - Abnormalities in haemorheological factors and lipoprotein (a) in retinal vascular occlusion: implications for increased vascular risk.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of retinal vascular occlusion (RVO), which includes patients with retinal vein or artery occlusions, may be associated with abnormalities of rheology and coagulation. These abnormalities have previously been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. AIM, PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate changes in haemorheological factors (plasma viscosity, haematocrit, haemoglobin, white cell count (WCC), plasma fibrinogen (CLAUSS), soluble adhesion molecule P-selectin (associated with platelet activity and atherosclerosis; ELISA), von Willebrand factor (vWf, an index of endothelial dysfunction; ELISA), fibrin D-dimer (ELISA), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a), immunoturbidometric assay) and serum lipids, we conducted a cross-sectional case-controlled study of 49 patients (37 men; mean age 66.9 years, SD 12.1 years) with RVO; 34 patients had retinal vein occlusion, whilst 15 had retinal artery occlusion. Their results were compared with those in 36 healthy controls (21 men; mean age 63.7 years, SD 14.8 years). RESULTS: Patients with retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared with controls (both p < 0.0001). These patients also had significantly elevated levels of plasma viscosity, haematocrit, haemoglobin, plasma fibrinogen, PAI, fibrin D-dimer and serum Lp(a) compared with controls. Apart from a reduction in blood pressure, there were no significant differences in the indices measured in patients with retinal vein occlusion when levels measured during their first and second visits were compared. In patients with retinal artery occlusion mean plasma PAI levels were significantly lower at visit 2 compared with visit 1. Plasma viscosity was significantly correlated with fibrinogen (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.33, p = 0.03) and cholesterol (r = 0.32, p = 0.04), while P-selectin was correlated with Lp(a) levels (r = 0.38, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that abnormalities in haemorheological factors, fibrinogen and Lp(a) are present in patients with retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion. These abnormalities appear to persist even at follow-up examination 4-6 weeks later. Abnormalities in haemorheological factors, fibrinogen and Lp(a) may have a role in the pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion, perhaps acting synergistically with clinical risk factors such as blood pressure. In addition, as haemorheological factors, fibrinogen and Lp(a) are associated with vascular disease, these findings in patients with RVO may potentially contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

TI  - Effect of octreotide on 24-h blood pressure profile in acromegaly.  
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of octreotide, a somatostatin analog drug potentially able to inhibit growth hormone (GH), on the circadian blood pressure profile in a group of patients with acromegaly. Ten patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenoma were studied before and 6 months after treatment with subcutaneous octreotide 0.2 to 0.6 mg/day. Twenty-four hour blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 15 min at daytime (07:00 to 22:59) and every 30 min at nighttime (23:00 to 06:59) using a TM-2420 recorder. No correlation was found between GH levels and 24-h blood pressure in baseline conditions. Untreated patients had a significant nocturnal decrease of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < .01), and all showed a circadian systolic or diastolic blood pressure rhythm. During octreotide treatment, 24 h as well as nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly increased (P < .05), whereas daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not change. Treated patients did not have a nocturnal decline in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P = NS), and eight lost their systolic or diastolic blood pressure rhythm. In conclusion, blood pressure circadian rhythm seems to be maintained in acromegaly. Octreotide treatment is associated with an increase of 24-h and nighttime blood pressure, and with loss of circadian blood pressure rhythm. Splanchnic vasoconstriction by this drug, shifting blood to peripheral vessels, may explain this phenomenon.

TI  - The haemodynamic effects of ketanserin versus dihydralazine in severe early-onset hypertension in pregnancy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the haemodynamic efficacy of ketanserin (a selective serotonin2-receptor blocker) with dihydralazine in the management of severe early-onset hypertension in pregnancy. DESIGN: Subgroup analysis within a randomised prospective multicentre trial to compare haemodynamic effects as measured by pulmonary artery catherization. SETTING: Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Intensive Care Medicine, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam and Sophia Hospital, Zwolle. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one women with a diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg and a gestational age between 26 and 32 weeks. RESULTS: The antihypertensive efficacy of both drugs was comparable. Dihydralazine significantly increased cardiac output (P < 0.01), while ketanserin induced only minor changes in cardiac output. Systemic vascular resistance decreased in both groups, but the decrease was significantly more pronounced with dihydralazine compared with ketanserin. Ketanserin induced a significant but not clinically relevant increase in heart rate (P < 001, while dihydralazine caused marked tachycardia (P < 0.005). Left ventricular stroke work index was reduced to similar values in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The antihypertensive profile of ketanserin is characterised by an early and gradual reduction of blood pressure in combination with a moderate decrease in systemic vascular resistance and no significant change in cardiac output. Dihydralazine causes market tachycardia resulting in a considerable increase in cardiac output.

TI  - Anxiolytic and blood pressure effects of acute static compared to dynamic exercise.  
AB  - This experiment tested whether state anxiety and blood pressure responses to exercise were influenced by the type of muscular contraction performed. On testing day 1, 11 volunteers completed one-repetition maximums (1-RMs) separately for the right and left limbs: arm extension, arm flexion, leg extension and leg flexion (8 total exercises). On two subsequent days, which were randomly ordered, subjects completed 24 minutes of either static or dynamic exercise. Both the static and dynamic exercise conditions involved eight 3-min exercise periods performed at an intensity equal to 10% of 1-RM and separated by a 1-min rest period. In the dynamic exercise condition, exercise was performed at a rate of 20 contractions x min(-1). State anxiety and blood pressure were assessed immediately before as well as 3, 13, and 23 minutes following exercise. Heart rate was assessed continuously during exercise, and overall ratings of perceived exertion were obtained during the last 15 seconds of each 3-min exercise period. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that state anxiety and systolic blood pressure were reduced to a similar degree following both static and dynamic exercise. It is concluded that anxiety and systolic blood pressure responses to acute exercise are not mediated by the type of muscle contraction performed.

TI  - [Influence of the sex of the physician in the alerting reaction in blood pressure determination in the elderly. EPICARDIAN Working Group]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure measurements by a physician and to a lesser extent by a nurse often lead the patient to experience an alerting reaction associated with an increase in blood pressure. The main factor seems to be the interaction between the patient and the observer physicians, on average, record higher office blood pressure than nurses and non-physicians. There is no information about the influence of the physician's gender on alerting reaction. OBJECTIVE: To asses the influence of gender's doctor on alerting reaction in the elderly. METHODOLOGY: EPICARDIAN study is a cross-sectional survey of the civilian non-institutionalized elderly population in a health area, including an inhome interview (phase I, n = 1,200) and a clinical examination (phase II, a random sample n = 333). Three different blood pressure measurements were performed: conventional blood pressure was measured by trained nurses at the participant's home, and at the hospital by two physicians: a man (group A, n = 131, 46% men) and a women (group B, n = 152, 45% men). All subjects were informed by a nurse that they were going to be interviewed by a doctor. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was recorded at 15 minute intervals, awake and sleep periods were defined based on daily activities. Alerting reaction was defined as the difference between means at home, office and awake period. RESULTS: Office blood pressures were distinctively higher than the awake average (15 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 7 mmHg for diastolic respectively) in 83% of subjects. Differences between clinical and awake average blood pressure were significantly higher in females than in males (17 +/- 16 and 12 +/- 16 respectively, p < 0.0001) and increased, in both sexes with increasing age (p = 0.001) and clinic blood pressure values (p < 0.001). There were no sex, age, body mass index, casual home blood pressure and awake blood pressure period differences between groups A and B. Group A, interviewed by a man, showed an average of 10 mmHg more than group B, interviewed by a woman, on office alerting reaction (22 +/- 18/11 +/- 11 mmHg versus 12 +/- 16/3.6 +/- 10 mmHg systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure alerting reaction, respectively p < 0.001 in both cases). Differences were similar when analizying men and women independently. CONCLUSION: Alerting reaction during blood pressure measurement in the elderly is higher when the observer is a male physician than when the physician is a female, independent of the patient's gender.

TI  - A limited renal injury may cause a permanent form of neurogenic hypertension.  
AB  - Previously, we have shown that an acute injury to the kidney produced by an intrarenal injection of phenol causes an immediate increase in blood pressure and in norepinephrine (NE) secretion from the posterior hypothalamus. The studies suggest that in this model afferent impulses from the kidney to central integrative structures in the brain may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure. To further evaluate whether a renal injury caused by the intrarenal injection of phenol leads to a permanent elevation of blood pressure and whether this is mediated by increased sympathetic nervous system activity, we examined the chronic effects (4 weeks) of an intrarenal injection of 50 microL of 10% phenol on blood pressure and NE secretion from the posterior hypothalamus. Systolic blood pressure increased from 128 +/- 2.1 to 176 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (P < .01) 4 weeks after receiving the intrarenal injection of phenol, but it did not change in rats that received the vehicle (128 +/- 2.4 and 135 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) and in rats that were subjected to renal denervation (127 +/- 3.4 and 124 +/- 1.0 mm Hg). The secretion of NE from the posterior hypothalamic nuclei was greater (P < .01) in rats that received phenol (253 +/- 9.6 pg/mL) than in controls (158 +/- 8.6 pg/mL) and denervated rats (170 +/- 2.1 pg/mL). These studies have shown that a limited injury to one kidney may cause a permanent elevation of blood pressure and this is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.

TI  - The involvement of plasma kinins in the cardiovascular effects of Leiurus quinquestriatus scorpion venom in anaesthetised rabbits.  
AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of kinins in the cardiovascular- and respiratory effects of LQQ venom. Blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration were studied in anaesthetised rabbits, in the presence and absence of aprotinin and icatibant, a B2 bradykinin antagonist. Plasma bradykinin concentrations were also measured following venom injection. LQQ venom caused a triphasic effect on blood pressure comprising an immediate fall, a pronounced rise and a progressive decline until death. Bradycardia, myocardial damage, arrhythmias, respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema were also exhibited. Pretreatment with aprotinin attenuated the venom-induced hypotension, bradycardia, ECG and respiratory changes and prolonged survival. Pretreatment of atropinized animals with icatibant gave similar protection. In animals treated with LQQ venom, plasma bradykinin was significantly higher than controls, although there was considerable inter-animal variation in plasma kinin concentrations and the elevation was seen relatively late after venom administration. The data provides some support for the hypothesis that kinins are involved in the cardiovascular and lethal effects of LQQ venom in rabbits.

TI  - Effects of hypervolemia and hypovolemia on cardiac and posterior lymph heart function in the toad Bufo marinus (L.).  
AB  - Cardiac and posterior lymph heart function in the toad Bufo marinus (L.) were measured in response to hemorrhage and both systemic and lymphatic volume loading to evaluate the role of the amphibian lymphatic system in fluid regulation. In every animal, systemic volume loading elicited an initial sharp rise in mean arterial blood pressure, corresponding to an immediate cessation of lymph heart contraction lasting approximately 12 min. This was followed by a short-term decrease in blood pressure, to 36% below normal. While stroke volume and lymph flow for the individual animals increased variably over a 6-h period, mean lymph heart rate and pressure varied little. Lymphatic volume loading elicited only minor changes in blood heart and lymph heart rate. Again, stroke volume and lymph flow increased variably, with the effect lasting about 13 h. Hypovolemia caused a sharp drop in blood pressure and a corresponding rise in blood heart rate. Lymph heart variables changed little, with the exception of rate, which, in some animals, was elevated for approximately 20 min following hemorrhage.

TI  - Evidence for a central origin of the low-frequency oscillation in RR-interval variability.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term variability of RR interval and blood pressure occurs predominantly at low frequency (LF; approximately 0.1 Hz) and high frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz). The arterial baroreflex is thought to be the predominant determinant of the LF component of RR variability. Patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) have an attenuated or absent LF oscillation in RR variability. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) offers a unique possibility for analysis of spectral oscillations in RR interval independent of any effects of blood pressure that influence these oscillations via the baroreflex. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed spectral analysis of RR, blood pressure, and respiration in 2 patients with CHF before and after LVAD implantation. LF components of the RR-interval and blood pressure variability were absent in both CHF patients before LVAD implantation. After LVAD implantation, spectral analysis of the RR interval showed restoration of a clear and predominant LF oscillation in the native hearts of both patients, with no such oscillation evident in the blood pressure profile. CONCLUSIONS: During total circulatory support with the LVAD, the LF oscillation in RR interval of the native heart, absent in CHF, is restored. This LF oscillation in RR interval occurs in the absence of LF oscillations in blood pressure and thus is unlikely to be explained by baroreflex mechanisms. Hence, the absence of LF oscillation in the RR interval in CHF is functional and is reversible by LVAD circulation. The presence of a predominant LF oscillation in RR interval independent of any oscillation in blood pressure suggests that the LF oscillation is a fundamental property of central autonomic outflow.

TI  - Self-monitoring of blood pressure at home: how many measurements are needed?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum number of self-measurements of blood pressure at home (HBP) necessary to provide the maximum clinically important benefit. METHODS: Hypertensive patients were randomly allocated to monitor HBP for 2 weeks (6 work days, duplicate measurements, twice daily) or ambulatory blood pressure for 24 h. The alternative measurement was then performed. Clinic blood pressure was measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Criteria for reliability of HBP were the stabilization of mean HBP, its variability (SD) and the correlation coefficient r for relationship of HBP with ambulatory blood pressure. The reproducibility of HBP was quantified using test-re-test correlations and the SD of differences between average HBP values of different days. RESULTS: We studied 189 patients (79 being administered stable antihypertensive treatment). Average HBP (137.5 +/- 16.2/85.9 +/- 9.9 mmHg) was lower than average clinic blood pressure (P<0.001) and higher than 24 h and night-time ambulatory blood pressures (P<0.001). There was no difference between HBP and daytime ambulatory blood pressure. On day 1 HBP was higher than it was on each of days 2-6, with no difference among days 2-6. When data for the initial day for monitoring of HBP were excluded from analysis, average HBP was reduced. Only a modest improvement in the reliability of HBP on day 2 (reductions in mean HBP and its SD and an increase in r with ambulatory blood pressure) was achieved by averaging more readings taken on succeeding days. At least two monitoring days were needed for the reproducibility of HBP to be superior to that of clinic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that determining average HBP of the second and third work days, is the minimum programme that provides a reliable estimate of HBP.

TI  - Synergistic effects of combined converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism on blood pressure in conscious telemetered spontaneously hypertensive rats.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the chronic effects of combined administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (valsartan) and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (benazeprilat) on blood pressure and heart rate in conscious telemetered spontaneously hypertensive rats. METHODS: Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored (by radiotelemetry) during 2-week infusions of 0.5-10 mg/kg valsartan per day and 0.5-10 mg/kg benazeprilat per day, alone or in combination, into conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Also, responses of blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats to exogenous angiotensin I and II were determined. RESULTS: Synergistic antihypertensive effects were observed when valsartan and benazeprilat were coadministered at submaximal monotherapy doses in the range 0.5-1.5 mg/kg per day. For all combination groups, the area over the curve (mmHg x days) for lowering of blood pressure was significantly greater (synergy) than that predicted from the sum of the monotherapy responses. Combination therapy abrogated pressor responses to angiotensin I more effectively than did comparable doses of the monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that combination therapy aimed at interrupting operation of the renin-angiotensin system simultaneously at multiple sites can prevent the partial escape which occurs during chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy. Furthermore, multiple-site intervention results in a more efficacious antihypertensive response than that achieved with high doses of the individual monotherapies.

TI  - Effects of the AT1 antagonist HR 720 in comparison to losartan on stimulated sympathetic outflow, blood pressure, and heart rate in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats.  
AB  - It has been demonstrated in isolated organs that angiotensin II mediates catecholamine release via presynaptically located AT1 receptor subtypes. In the present study, the relevance of AT1-mediated noradrenaline and adrenaline release in a whole-animal model, which reflects the peripherally sympathetic system (pithed rat), was investigated. Furthermore, the effects of a new AT1 antagonist, HR 720, are demonstrated with respect to its pre- and postsynaptic actions in comparison to the AT1 antagonist losartan. Dose-response curves to angiotensin II of blood pressure show a tenfold higher potency for HR 720 to compete for angiotensin II, thereby decreasing the maximum effects when compared with losartan. The electrically induced sympathetic outflow resulted in a dose-dependent increase after angiotensin II infusions. It could markedly be reduced with both AT1 antagonists, whereby HR 720 again was ten times more potent than losartan. Neither with HR 720 nor with losartan an agonistic activity could be demonstrated. The results indicate an AT1 receptor subtype mediated release of catecholamines in a whole-animal model. HR 720 is ten times more potent than the AT1 antagonist losartan and acts in a noncompetitive manner.

TI  - Effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac autonomic nervous control.  
AB  - Diabetes-associated alterations in resting heart rate and blood pressure have been demonstrated in clinical studies and in animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). These alterations may result from changes in the heart, vasculature or autonomic nervous system control. Using the streptozotocin- (STZ-) treated rat model of IDDM, the current study was designed to: (1) monitor changes in heart rate and blood pressure continually during a 10-week period in conscious unrestrained animals; and (2) determine if observed alterations in heart rate were mediated by changes in sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nervous control. Biotelemetry techniques were used. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded 24 h a day at 10 min intervals before and after induction of diabetes. Diabetes was induced by i.v. administration of 50 mg/kg STZ. Resting autonomic nervous system tone was estimated by chronotropic responses to full-blocking doses of nadolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) and atropine (10 mg/kg i.p.). STZ-induced diabetes was associated with time-dependent reductions in heart rate and its circadian variation. Diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure did not differ significantly when compared between control and STZ-treated animals; however, pulse pressure was diminished in diabetic rats. Chronotropic responses to both nadolol and atropine were blunted significantly in diabetic animals suggesting that resting levels of both vagal and sympathetic nervous tone to the heart were diminished. Heart rate in the presence of both nadolol and atropine was also decreased in diabetic rats. All effects observed following administration of STZ were reversed, at least in part, by insulin treatment. These results suggest that IDDM is associated with time-dependent reductions in resting heart rate and autonomic nervous control of cardiac function.

TI  - Role of sympathetic nervous system in hypertension and effects of cardiovascular drugs.  
AB  - The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac performance and peripheral circulation. Changes in SNS activity measured as catecholamines in plasma or organ spillover have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Recent studies using microneurography to directly assess peripheral sympathetic nerve activity have demonstrated an increase in sympathetic activity in patients with borderline hypertension at rest and during hypoxia. We have recently shown that resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity is comparable in offspring of hypertensive and normotensive parents. However, during mental arithmetic the increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure was significantly more pronounced in offspring of hypertensive than in offspring of normotensive parents, but resting blood pressure was in the normotensive range and comparable in both groups. These data indicate that the response to mental stress results in a more pronounced activation of SNS in normotensive subjects with a genetic background of hypertension. In other cardiovascular disease states such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure activity of the SNS may determine prognosis significantly. Some calcium antagonists which are successfully used to treat patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris may have unfavourable effects in patients with impaired left ventricular function. This could be due in part to baroreceptor-mediated activation of the SNS, an effect which seems to be related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. In contrast, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors seem to directly decrease sympathetic nerve activity. This may explain at least in part their beneficial effects in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Thus, the SNS as a regulator of the cardiovascular system also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Furthermore, drug therapy could have a significant impact on the activity of the SNS.

TI  - [The evaluation of the hypertensive patient via self-measured blood pressure at home]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence currently exist that treatment, and therefore prognosis, of the hypertensive patient can be improved by complementing the clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements with measurements taken out of the health care setting. The goal of the study was to validate a standard procedure of home BP self-measurement in contrast with a non invasive ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). METHOD: This was a transversal and descriptive study set at the primary care level. 58 hypertensive patients with poor office control were instructed to self-measure their BP, with a previously verified digital sphygmomanometer, at home, 30 times for 10 days, and in the close 15 days an ABPM was taken for 24 hours. Reliability was determined comparing the degree of agreement between the different methods via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the analysis of the individual differences. RESULTS: The self-measured BP and the ABPM do not differ significantly in systolic BP and only by 1.88 mmHg for the diastolic BP. The results taken in the office are significantly superior to those obtained by other methods -23 mmHg for the systolic BP and from 9 to 11 mmHg for the diastolic BP-. The ICC obtained comparing the results of the self-measured BP and ABPM are of 0.73 for systolic and 0.76 for the diastolic, whereas in the comparisons between office/self-measured, and office/ABPM the ICCs fluctuate from 0.23 to 0.50. The graphic analysis of individual differences allows the evaluation of the degree of reliability and the independence to the "white coat phenomenon". CONCLUSIONS: The BP self-measurement protocol that we present is a valid instrument, capable of confirming hypertension as well a suspicion of "white coat phenomenon" particularly when the availability of ABPM is scarce.

TI  - [A software for comparing ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM)]  
AB  - The software (MAPA-PC) for personal computers, designed by the author, provides precise and fast studies of ABPM, especially when comparing two anti-hypertensive treatments. It implies strict definitions of groups (e.g. dippers), indices (peak, trough, peak/trough ratio), and the type of smoothing of measured values: means (over 1, 2 or 3 hours) or smoothing by functions (polynomials or trigonometric series). The software calculates standard parameters (nighttime and daytime means, peak, trough...) as well as more original values (nighttime and period from points of inflexion in the curve, slope in these points, coefficients of variation on differences between 2 ABPM of a given subject...). It uses statistical tests (Mann and Whitney's U. Pearson's chi square, Snedecor's F) to compare results of treatment. It provides many types of curves (blood pressure lines, box-plots) which show kinetics and variability of blood pressure. The user can compare various types of smoothing (e.g. 2 vs 3 harmonics in Fourier series). The software was used on 237 records of 79 patients, in a randomized trial. It was written with Turbo Pascal and works on DOS personal computers. It is interesting for epidemiologic studies or clinical trials in which ABPM are used.

TI  - Angiotensinogen genotype, sodium reduction, weight loss, and prevention of hypertension: trials of hypertension prevention, phase II [see comments]  
AB  - The angiotensinogen gene has been linked to essential hypertension and increased blood pressure. A functional variant believed to be responsible for hypertension susceptibility occurs at position -6 in the promoter region of the gene in which an A for G base pair substitution is associated with higher angiotensinogen levels. To test whether an allele within the angiotensinogen gene is related to subsequent incidence of hypertension and blood pressure response to sustained sodium reduction, 1509 white male and female subjects participating in phase II of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention were genotyped at the angiotensinogen locus. Participants had diastolic blood pressures between 83 and 89 mm Hg and were randomized in a 2x2 factorial design to sodium reduction, weight loss, combined intervention, or usual care groups. Persons in the usual care group with the AA genotype at nucleotide position -6 had a higher 3-year incidence rate of hypertension (44.6%) compared with those with the GG genotype (31.5%), with a relative risk of 1.4 (95% confidence interval [0.87, 2.34], test for trend across all 3 genotypes, P=0.10). In contrast, the incidence of hypertension was significantly lower after sodium reduction for persons with the AA genotype (relative risk=0.57 [0.34, 0.98] versus usual care) but not for persons with the GG genotype (relative risk=1.2 [0.79, 1.81], test for trend P=0.02). Decreases of diastolic blood pressure at 36 months in the sodium reduction group versus usual care showed a significant trend across all 3 genotypes (P=0.01), with greater net blood pressure reduction in those with the AA genotype (-2.2 mm Hg) than those with the GG genotype (+1.1 mm Hg). A similar trend across the 3 genotypes for net systolic blood pressure reduction (-2.7 for AA versus -0.2 mm Hg for GG) was not significant (P=0.17). Trends across genotypes for the effects of weight loss on hypertension incidence and decreases in blood pressure were similar to those for sodium reduction. We conclude that the angiotensinogen genotype may affect blood pressure response to sodium or weight reduction and the development of hypertension.

TI  - Statistical base value of 24-hour blood pressure distribution in patients with essential hypertension.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to calculate statistically the minimum (base) blood pressure (BP) of nighttime (sleep-time) BP values obtained by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and to investigate its clinical significance. Twenty-four-hour recording of ECG with ABPM was performed directly (n=89) or indirectly (n=117) in 206 patients with essential hypertension. A telemeter was used for the direct method and a multi-biomedical recorder (TM2425) was used for indirect measurement. First, minimum heart rate (HR0=60/RR0) was determined from sleep-time ECG. The mean product of sleep-time diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse interval (RR) was divided by RR0 to obtain DBP0 [DBP0=(DBPxRR)s/RR0]. The correlation between systolic BP (SBP) and DBP was used to determine SBP0 corresponding to DBP0. Statistical base mean BP (MBP0) was calculated from these values, and its reproducibility and relation to hypertension severity were investigated. MBP0 values were similar to true base values of sleep-time MBP obtained by the direct method (mean+/-SD difference, 2.0+/-4.2 mm Hg). Direct MBP0 criteria predicted hypertension severity (mild, moderate, or severe target organ damage) more accurately (predictive accuracy, 89%) than daytime MBP criteria (53%, P<0.01). Almost the same results were obtained using indirect MBP0 criteria. Day-to-day indirect MBP0 variation (mean absolute difference) was smaller (2.4+/-1.8 mm Hg) than day-to-day daytime and nighttime MBP variation (6.3+/-5.3 and 5.4+/-3.4 mm Hg, respectively; n=61, P<0.01), and the correlation coefficient between day-to-day variations of daytime MBP and physical activity (measured by an acceleration sensor) was 0.38 (P<0.05). In conclusion, statistical base BP was almost equal to true base (minimum) BP of sleep-time BP distribution. It was closely related to the severity of hypertensive organ damage, was highly reproducible, and is considered likely to serve stochastically and physiologically as a representative BP value in an individual subject.

TI  - Participation of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with essential hypertension.  
AB  - Oxidative stress and inflammation have recently been linked to endothelial damage in essential hypertension (EH). Activated peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) damage surrounding tissue by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes before self-necrosis. PMN necrosis further exacerbates inflammation and promotes chemotaxis and PMN recruitment. The number and properties of PMN from untreated EH patients is the focus of the present study. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the rate of superoxide anion release from separated, phorbol ester-stimulated PMN and the redox state of plasma glutathione. Inflammation was estimated indirectly by determining PMN number and their in vitro survival. PMN from EH patients (n = 37) released superoxide anion faster (P < .0001) than those of normotensives (NC, n = 37), 17.7 +/- 1.14 v 9.54 +/- 0.51 nmol/10 min/10(6) cells. The redox state of glutathione was twofold higher in EH plasma (P < .02) indicating systemic oxidative stress. PMN survival in vitro correlates linearly with the rate of superoxide release (r2 = 0.60, P < .02) and PMN count of EH patients, although in the normal range, were significantly higher (P < .0001), indicating necrosis and recruitment. Hypertensive plasma significantly reduced NC PMN viability, whereas normal plasma significantly increased EH PMN viability. What our studies show is that EH is accompanied by a primed state PMN that does not correlate with the levels of blood pressure. PMN priming in EH patients reflects an in vivo exposure to a constant stimulus ending in oxidative stress, increased self-necrosis, and cell recruitment. Oxidative stress and inflammation will result in endothelial damage and atherosclerosis in the long run.

TI  - Hemodynamic response to vasopressin in dehydrated human subjects.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the known potent vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin, the role of this hormone in the maintenance of blood pressure is incompletely understood. In studies performed in animals with increased plasma vasopressin concentrations, several complex cardiovascular effects have been noted, including decreases in heart rate and cardiac output, which may account for a lack of effect on arterial pressure despite the vasopressin-induced increase in total peripheral resistance. Only a few studies have been done to assess the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin in human subjects, and most of these have been limited to measurement of heart rate and arterial pressure only. The present study was designed to identify more fully the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin when plasma vasopressin concentrations are increased by osmotic stimulation without the superimposition of major nonosmotic stimuli associated with severe volume depletion. METHOD: Studies were performed on 11 normal human subjects in supine and erect posture before and after 24 hours of fluid deprivation, and following administration of a selective V1 receptor antagonist, [d(CH2)5Tyr(ME)]AVP, after dehydration. Cardiovascular parameters were measured noninvasively by thoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiography and blood samples for measurements of plasma concentrations of vasopressin and other hormones affected by dehydration and differences in posture were collected for subsequent analysis. RESULTS: After 24 hours of fluid restriction, plasma osmolality was increased from 287 +/- 0.9 to 294 +/- 0.7 mosm/kg H20 and plasma vasopressin concentrations (Pavp) were increased in both supine and erect posture. Mean arterial (MAP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were reduced by fluid restriction but were higher in erect than in supine posture both before and after fluid restriction. Heart rate (HR), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and systemic vascular resistance (SVRI) were also higher in erect than in supine posture, while cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI), end-diastolic index (EDI), and an index of total thoracic fluid content (TFC) were all reduced in erect posture, both before and after dehydration. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (Pne) were increased in erect posture, both before and after dehydration, but there was no effect of erect posture on plasma vasopressin concentrations (Pavp), either before or after dehydration. Administration of the V1 receptor antagonist after dehydration had no effect on hemodynamic parameters other than small reductions in DBP and cardiac preload. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from these studies that small increases in Pavp associated with moderate dehydration do not play a role in the maintenance of arterial pressure in normal human subjects in either supine or erect posture.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for hypertension in general practice.  
AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is being increasingly used in general practice. There is at present little published evidence regarding the clinical utility of ABPM in the care of patients with established hypertension in this setting. We examined this issue by undertaking ABPM in a group of patients with established hypertension. 40 patients (aged 33-60 years) currently being treated for hypertension were randomly selected from a general practice list and underwent a single 24-hour ABPM study. ABPM values were compared with clinic blood pressure (CBP) values obtained on the day of monitoring together with previous readings taken by the general practitioner (GP). In the case of mean arterial pressure, 24-hour, awake and asleep ABPM values were found to underestimate CBP values by 14 mmHg (95% confidence interval 11-16 mmHg), 9 mmHg (95% C16-12 mmHg) and 24 mmHg (95% CI 21-27 mmHg), respectively. When used to classify blood pressure control, ABPM values produced equivalent results to CBP except by the criterion of BP load, for which 24-hour ABPM showed a higher rate of unsatisfactory control. 5 patients classified by CBP to have satisfactory BP control according to current international guidelines were found to have unsatisfactory BP control by ABPM. This study demonstrates the potential value of ABPM in patients with essential hypertension in a general practice setting. ABPM provided information over and above that obtained by CBP in a substantial proportion of patients.

TI  - Enhancement of the vasodepressor response to adenosine by nicorandil in rats: comparison with cromakalim.  
AB  - The effect of nicorandil on systemic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) responses to adenosine was compared with that of cromakalim, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channel opener, in anesthetized rats. Intravenous (i.v.) adenosine in doses of 1-100 micrograms/kg elicited dose-dependent decreases in SBP, accompanied by decreases in HR. Potentiation of adenosine action by i.v. infusion of either nicorandil (10 or 30 micrograms/kg per min) or cromakalim (0.1 microgram/kg per min) occurred in all of the animals tested. After i.v. treatment with glibenclamide (20 mg/kg), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, not only adenosine action but also the enhancement of adenosine action by nicorandil and cromakalim were significantly attenuated. The present result indicates that the enhancement of the adenosine action by nicorandil and cromakalim appears to occur at least partly through ATP-sensitive K+ channel activation.

TI  - Interrelationship of cardiovascular effects, plasma levels of nicorandil, and vascular cGMP formation in conscious rats.  
AB  - The relationship between the dual activity of nicorandil (KATP channel-opening activity and nitrate-like action), plasma levels, and changes in vascular cGMP levels and cardiovascular parameters was investigated in conscious rats. Nicorandil (3 mg kg(-1), p.o.) was rapidly absorbed and caused a significant reduction in blood pressure, lasting for at least 1 h, increases in heart rate and femoral blood flow, and decreases in femoral vascular resistance. These were entirely abolished by intravenous glibenclamide (20 mg kg(-1)). The plasma concentration of nicorandil reached a maximum 30 min after dosing. After administration of nicorandil, a correlation was observed between blood pressure and plasma nicorandil level or femoral vascular resistance. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in the cGMP content of the thoracic aorta occurred 15 min after administration of nicorandil, and persisted for at least 2 h. These results imply that nicorandil induces vasodilatation by opening KATP channels in peripheral resistance vessels, leading to overt reduction of blood pressure, but acts on conductance vessels mainly through nitrate-like activity.
