TI  - Cold storage induces an endothelium-independent relaxation to hypoxia/reoxygenation in porcine coronary arteries.  
AB  - Tissues are often cold stored for physiological studies and for clinical transplantation. We report that cold storage induces a relaxation to reoxygenation after hypoxia (H/R) in de-endothelialized porcine coronary arteries. In fresh denuded arteries stimulated with U46619, H/R did not elicit relaxation. However, after overnight cold storage (4 degrees C), H/R elicited a transient relaxation with peak relaxation of 56 +/- 8% (n = 8), which was reproducible after 2 days of cold storage. The H/R relaxation was inhibited by methylene blue (10 microM) and LY83583 (10 microM), O2-hemoglobin (1 microM), or N(G)-methyl-L-arginine (0.2 mM), but neither N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (0.2 mM) nor cyclo-oxygenase inhibition was effective. Importantly, the H/R relaxation was attenuated by KCl (40 mM) or tetrabutylammonium chloride (5 mM), a non-selective inhibitor of K+ channels. Interestingly, authentic nitric oxide (NO)- or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)-induced relaxations were enhanced by cold storage in U46619 (0.1 microM) contractures. When tissues were contracted with KCl (40 mM), the enhancement in NO- or SNAP-induced relaxation by cold storage was markedly smaller than with U46619. Neither catalase (1,200 U/ml) nor 3-amino-triazole (50 mM), an inhibitor of catalase, affected the H/R relaxation. The duration of H/R relaxation also increased with the period of incubation at 37 degrees C in the organ bath. This was blocked by inhibition of NO synthesis or guanylate cyclase. Moreover, inhibition of protein synthesis with actinomycin D (0.1 microM) and cycloheximide (10 microM), or dexamethasone (1 microM), an inhibitor of NO synthase induction, blocked this increase in the duration of the H/R relaxation. The results suggest that in smooth muscle induction of NO pathway relaxation, which is in part mediated by K+ channels and inducible NO synthase, may be of importance to the understanding of ischemia/reperfusion responses in cold-stored arteries.

TI  - Cold and post-traumatic pain: modeling of the peripheral nerve message.  
AB  - Hypersensitivity to cold is a relatively frequent sequel of peripheral nerve injuries but its mechanism is not well understood. We suggested that incomplete recovery of diameter of regenerated fibers is one of the factors involved in cold intolerance after nerve damage. Conduction velocity is correlated to fiber diameter, and is slowed down by cold. In normal subjects, cold does not desynchronize the volleys of sensory impulses sufficiently to change the intelligibility of the peripheral 'messages'. Sensory perceptions remain accurate although they acquire a characteristic numbness. On the other hand, post-traumatic reduction in fiber diameters causes a permanent distortion of the messages. We considered that when the distortion is severe, the resulting messages may be perceived by the centers as containing nociceptive components. We further hypothesized that, even in cases of moderate permanent distortion, cold acts by increasing the post-traumatic abnormalities of impulse synchronization. In winter, decompensation is observed when a threshold of desynchronization is reached. We constructed a model of peripheral nerve messages in an attempt to represent and quantitate the desynchronizations produced by cold and crush damage lesions in peripheral nerve messages. A number of parameters concerning fiber anatomy, exposure to cold, and type of nerve damage were taken into consideration. Four elementary types of desynchronization could be recognized by considering the times of arrival of pairs of impulses at the nervous centers. The difference between a normal and a distorted message could be expressed by eight variables. Thus, although our model was quite simple, a large amount of data was obtained and a preliminary statistical study was necessary in order to orient the final analysis. Then, we used factor analysis in an attempt to obtain a satisfactory interpretation of the data. The results indicated that peripheral desynchronization might explain, at least in part, the painful sensations experienced in winter by many patients after peripheral nerve injury.

TI  - A reassessment of the molecular origin of cold denaturation.  
AB  - The existence of cold denaturation is now firmly demonstrated by its direct observation for several globular proteins in aqueous solution. But the physico-chemical explanation of this intriguing phenomenon is still unsatisfactory. In this paper we deepen our understanding of cold denaturation by taking advantage of the theoretical model developed by Ikegami and using thermodynamic data on the transfer to water of liquid N-alkyl amides. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the presence of water is fundamental to determine the existence of cold denaturation due to its strong energetic interaction with the amino acid residues previously buried in the protein's interior.

TI  - Clinical manifestations and diagnostic approach to metastatic cancer of the mandible.  
AB  - In a 12-month period, metastatic cancer was diagnosed in eight patients. Six of them presented with pain mimicking toothache, temporomandibular joint disorders or trigeminal neuralgia, while two showed osteopenic bone lesions in the panoramic radiography, and perimandibular swelling. Anesthesia of the lower lip was the only common clinical feature. In seven of the eight patients, a whole body bone scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the skull in combination with a whole body and SPECT anti-granulocyte (Tc-99m MAK 250/183) bone marrow scintigraphy was performed. One patient did not have combined scintigraphy performed secondary to severe systemic illness. In six of the seven, the results were conclusive for a metastatic bone lesion. Biopsies confirmed three patients to have a previously unrecognized primary cancer, one patient to have previously unrecognized recurrent cancer, and three patients to exhibit new metastatic spread of an already diagnosed cancer. Histology revealed breast, lung, renal cancer and a malignancy of inconclusive origin. In the remaining patient, combined scintigraphy suggested osteomyelitis, yet biopsy revealed a prostate cancer metastasis with acute inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, the scintigraphy pattern of a hot spot in the bone scan and a cold lesion in the bone marrow scintigraphy is highly suggestive of a mandibular metastasis, if accompanied by anesthesia of the lower lip.

Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that protein synthesis was deregulated in csp double mutants and that the loss of one or two CSPs led to an increase in the synthesis of the remaining CSP(s) at 37 degrees C and after cold shock, suggesting that CSPs down-regulate production of members from this protein family.

TI  - A family of cold shock proteins in Bacillus subtilis is essential for cellular growth and for efficient protein synthesis at optimal and low temperatures.  
AB  - Like other bacteria, Bacillus subtilis possesses a family of homologous small acidic proteins (CspB, CspC and CspD, identity >70%) that are strongly induced in response to cold shock. We show that deletion of cspC or cspD genes did not result in a detectable phenotype; in contrast, csp double mutants exhibited severe reduction in cellular growth at 15 degrees C as well as at 37 degrees C, including impairment of survival during the stationary phase. Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that protein synthesis was deregulated in csp double mutants and that the loss of one or two CSPs led to an increase in the synthesis of the remaining CSP(s) at 37 degrees C and after cold shock, suggesting that CSPs down-regulate production of members from this protein family. A cspB/C/D triple mutant (64BCDbt) could only be generated in the presence of cspB in trans on a plasmid that was not lost, in spite of lack of antibiotic pressure, indicating that a minimum of one csp gene is essential for viability of B. subtilis. After cold shock, synthesis of CspB in 64BCDbt was drastically lower than in wild-type cells accompanied by cessation in growth and strong reduction in general protein synthesis. As CspB, CspC and CspD are shown to bind to RNA in a co-operative and interactive manner, CSPs are suggested to function as RNA chaperones facilitating the initiation of translation under optimal and low temperatures.

TI  - Trimetazidine prevents renal injury in the isolated perfused pig kidney exposed to prolonged cold ischemia.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemia caused by cold storage (CS) and reperfusion of the kidney is often responsible for delayed graft function after transplantation. Significant attention has been focused on the cascade of events involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury, with the objective of identifying drugs to ameliorate the functional damage that occurs. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the renal function of isolated perfused pig kidneys after 48 hr of CS with Euro-Collins (EC) solution plus trimetazidine (EC+TMZ), standard EC solution, or University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Normothermic isolated perfused pig kidneys were randomized into five experimental groups: (A) control group (cold flush with cold heparinized saline and immediately reperfused; n=6); (B) cold flush with cold heparinized saline with TMZ (10(-6) M), n=6; (C) 48 hr of CS with EC and reperfusion (n=8); (D) 48 hr of CS with EC+TMZ alone and reperfusion (n=8); (E) 48 hr of CS with UW and reperfusion (n=8). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biochemical studies were performed for the functional evaluation during reperfusion. Lipid peroxidation was also determined. Histological examination (optical and electron microscopy) was performed after CS and reperfusion. RESULTS: Using TMZ, the renal perfusate flow rate as well as the glomerular filtration rate and proximal tubular function were significantly improved. This improvement of renal function during reperfusion was correlated with a less significant cellular and interstitial edema. In addition, tubular injury markers were significantly lower in the group preserved with EC+TMZ, and TMZ reduced lipid peroxidation dramatically during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of TMZ to the EC solution increased the preservation quality and renal tubular function, and gave protection from reperfusion injury better than EC alone or UW. These results strongly suggest that TMZ has a cytoprotective effect and may therefore be useful for kidney preservation.

TI  - [Role of nitric oxide in warm ischemia of the transplanted kidney]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas considered to have two roles: cytoprotective, derived from its vasodilating and anti-platelet aggregation effects, and cytotoxic, due to its free oxygen radical. It is produced by NO synthase; nitrites and nitrates are its end products. We investigated the role of NO in ischemia-perfusion injury. METHODS: For the study, we utilized dogs weighing 15 to 25 kg. Autotransplantation of the left kidney and right nephrectomy were performed. Group I comprised 9 dogs submitted to renal autotransplantation; group II comprised 6 dogs submitted to renal autotransplantation after 24 h cold ischemia; group III comprised 6 dogs submitted to renal autotransplantation after 24 h cold ischemia and subsequent warm ischemia of 30 min; group IV comprised 9 dogs submitted to renal autotransplantation after 24 h cold ischemia and 60 min warm ischemia. RESULTS: A significant fall in nitrite levels was observed in dogs that had some type of surgical injury. Nitrate levels increased significantly in dogs that had warm ischemia. At 30 min reperfusion, a significant increase in the production of constitutive enzyme was observed in all groups. A significant increase in inducible enzyme at 30 min reperfusion was observed in the first three groups and no inducible enzyme was produced in the group that had more injury from ischemia (group IV). CONCLUSION: Nitrites are markers of the injury produced by surgery. Nitrates clearly express the injury to the organs caused by warm ischemia-reperfusion. The cNOS enzyme increases after surgery in response to surgical insult or stress. The iNOS enzyme increases in the kidneys that have suffered ischemia and are viable. Non-viable kidneys express no enzymatic activity (cNOS, iNOS).

TI  - Risk factors for sudden deafness: a case-control study.  
AB  - In order to investigate risk factors for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (sudden deafness), a case-control study was done in 109 patients with sudden deafness who visited our hospital between 1992 and 1994, with 109 controls matched to each patient by gender and age. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for smoking habits, drinking habits, dietary habits, environmental noise, past history of disease, sleeping hours, appetite, fatigue, incidence of common cold were obtained. Fatigue (OR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.36-7.90) and loss of appetite (OR: 8:00; 95% CI: 1.00-64.0) elevated the risk for sudden deafness. Those who ate many fresh vegetables were at a decreased risk (OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24-0.96 for light-colored vegetables, OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.30-1.02 for green-yellow vegetables). Personal histories of hypertension and thyroid disease, and susceptibility to colds appeared to be positively associated with the risk (0.05 < P < 0.10). Smoking habits, drinking habits and environmental noise had no significant association with sudden deafness. These results suggested that environmental factors, including diet, may be importantly involved in the genesis of sudden deafness.

TI  - Identification and analysis of a static culture-specific cell wall protein, Tir1p/Srp1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - A 100-kDa protein was found to be a major cell wall protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells cultured without shaking, but was not present in cells cultured with shaking. The amino acid sequence of this protein was identical to the sequence of Tir1p/Srp1p. TIR1/SRP1 has previously been identified as a gene induced by glucose, cold shock or anaerobiosis and was believed to be a cell membrane protein but not a cell wall protein. However, we found that beta-1,3-glucanase solubilized Tir1p/Srp1p from the cell wall and the purified Tir1p/Srp1p reacted with antiserum to beta-1,6-glucan and contained glucose. These results suggest that Tir1p/Srp1p is a major structural cell wall protein in the static-cultured yeast cells and is bound to the cell wall through beta-1,6-glucan. TIR1/SRP1 mRNA was transcribed only in the static culture and its transcription was regulated by the ROX1 repressor.

TI  - Relationship between cold tolerance and generation of suppressor macrophages during acute cold stress.  
AB  - Acute cold stress induces suppressor macrophages expressing large numbers of receptors to the crystallizable fragment (Fc) portion of immunoglobulin G (MAC-1+ FcgammaRII/IIIbright cells), resulting in the immunosuppression of splenocyte mitogenesis. The generation of MAC-1+ FcgammaRII/IIIbright cells is mediated by the action of glucocorticoids (GCs) through the GC-receptor. In the present study, the generation of MAC-1+ FcgammaRII/IIIbright cells in peritoneal exudate cells was closely related to the decrease of rectal temperature during 3-day exposure to 5 degrees C. We next investigated the effects of improved cold tolerance on the generation of MAC-1+ FcgammaRII/IIIbright cells during acute cold stress. Mice were adapted to cold by exposure to 5 degrees C for 3 wk (cold-acclimated mice) and then reexposed to 5 degrees C for 3 h (acute cold stress) after living at 25 degrees C for 24 h. The rectal temperature of cold-acclimated mice was not decreased by the acute cold stress. In addition, the proportion of MAC-1+ FcgammaRII/IIIbright cells in peritoneal exudate cell population from cold-acclimated mice was unaffected by the acute cold stress. The cold acclimation significantly attenuated the increases in serum corticosterone levels and the expression of the GC-receptor mRNA on peritoneal exudate cells in response to acute cold stress. These results suggest that the altered GC response to acute cold stress by the improvement of cold tolerance inhibits the generation of suppressor macrophages during acute cold stress.

TI  - Partitioning of proteins into plasma membrane microdomains. Clustering of mutant influenza virus hemagglutinins into coated pits depends on the strength of the internalization signal.  
AB  - Internalization of membrane proteins involves their recruitment into plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits, with which they are thought to interact by binding to AP-2 adaptor protein complexes. To investigate the interactions of membrane proteins with coated pits at the cell surface, we applied image correlation spectroscopy to measure directly and quantitatively the clustering of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein mutants carrying specific cytoplasmic internalization signals. The HA system enables direct comparison between isolated internalization signals, because HA itself is excluded from coated pits. The studies presented here provide, for the first time, a direct quantitative measure for the degree of clustering of membrane proteins in coated pits at the cell surface. The degree of clustering depended on the strength of the internalization signal and on the integrity of the clathrin lattices and correlated with the internalization rates of the mutants. The clustering of the HA mutants fully correlated with their ability to co-precipitate alpha-adaptin from whole cells, the first such demonstration for a membrane protein that is not a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Furthermore, both the clustering in coated pits and the co-precipitation with alpha-adaptin were dramatically reduced in the cold, suggesting that low temperature can interfere with the sorting of proteins into coated pits. In addition to the specific results reported here, the general applicability of the image correlation spectroscopy approach to study any process involving the clustering or oligomerization of membrane receptors at the cell surface is discussed.

TI  - Autoradiographic determination of marginal leakage of a pressed glass ceramic inlay.  
AB  - The marginal integrity and microleakage of pressed glass ceramic inlays were evaluated using autoradiography. IPS/Empress ceramic inlays were fabricated for 10 human molar mandibular teeth. After adjusting the inlays, they were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel for 30 s and silanized with Monobond S for 30 s. Before cementation with dual cure resin cement the inlays and cavity walls were gently covered with a thin layer of bonding agent. When the cementation process was completed the samples were cycled 300 times between a 55 degrees C hot bath and a 5 degrees C cold bath. The samples were placed in each bath for 60 s, with 5 s intervals between immersions, then the specimens were immersed in an aqueous solution of Ca-45. After 24 h the inlay and tooth assemblies were removed, rinsed with water and placed in cold-cured acrylic resin, then sectioned through the long axis for autoradiographic analysis. According to the penetration of Ca-45, the microleakage level was scored for each section. The results indicated slight penetration of Ca-45 on autoradiographic films.

AB  - The article reports a study examining symptoms of infection and use of medications and the health care system by breastfeeding or formula-feeding urban poor mothers. A prospective, self-report design was used. Mothers completed a demographic and anthropometric questionnaire, an infection checklist, and a medication and health care system survey. Results showed that more of the breastfeeders were white, older, and economically better off than formula feeders. Scores on the infection checklist were higher for those feeding their infants by bottle.  Colds, rashes, episodes of vomiting, ear infections, colic, and health care utilization were less frequent for breastfed infants. This small study suggests that there is a protective effect of breastfeeding in this population and provides a basis for larger epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies.

TI  - Detection of eubacteria in interstitial cystitis by 16S rDNA amplification.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine what role non-culturable microorganisms play in the etiology of interstitial cystitis (IC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients fulfilling NIH criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis and sixteen control patients with culture negative urine gave written informed consent and underwent bladder biopsy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of universal primers for bacterial 16S rDNA was performed on urine from the cystoscope and on a cold cup bladder biopsy specimen. Of the PCR positive bladder biopsies, three patients with interstitial cystitis and three controls were randomly selected and cloned. Ten clones from each were sequenced and putative taxonomic assignments made. RESULTS: 12/26 (46%) IC and 5/12 (42%) control urine specimens and 16/30 (53%) and 9/15 (60%) bladder biopsies were PCR positive, respectively. The bacterial populations in the two patient groups tested appeared to be different based upon analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Both IC and control patients had non-culturable bacteria in their bladders. A random sampling of the two populations revealed that the bacterial populations are different, suggesting a possible link between one or more bacterial species and IC.

TI  -  Chronic cold stress alters the basal and evoked electrophysiological activity of rat locus coeruleus neurons.  
AB  - In vivo extracellular single-unit recording techniques revealed that chronic cold stress significantly alters both the basal and the evoked electrophysiological activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus of the anaesthetized rat. Following 17-21 days of chronic cold exposure (5 degrees C), the single-unit activity of histologically-identified locus coeruleus neurons in chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats was recorded and analysed in terms of their basal firing rate and pattern of spike activity, as well as their response to footshock stimulation. There was no significant difference in the incidence of spontaneously active cells/electrode track between cold-stressed rats and control rats. However, the basal spike activity of locus coeruleus cells recorded from cold-stressed rats differed significantly from that of control rats along two dimensions: i) they displayed significantly higher basal firing rates (mean = 1.88 Hz vs 1.20 Hz, respectively); and ii) they frequently exhibited spontaneous burst-firing activity that was not observed in control rats (observed in 15/17 cold-stressed rats vs 1/26 control rats). The evoked spike activity of locus coeruleus cells in cold-stressed rats also differed significantly from that of control rats along two dimensions: i) they were more likely to respond to footshock stimulation (mean = 90.3% vs 74.4%, respectively); and ii) these responses were more likely to consist of multispike bursts of action potentials (mean = 8 bursts/50 stimulations vs 1 burst/50 stimulations, respectively). These results indicate that alterations in the electrophysiological activity of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons may contribute to the phenomenon of stress-induced sensitization of norepinephrine release that is thought to underlie some of the neuropathological changes that accompany long-term stress.

AB  - A previous study showed that recombinant leptin markedly affects the body fat content and thermoregulatory energy expenditure of lean (+/+ and +/fa) suckling-age rats, and we wanted to find out whether leptin in doses that halved body fat of cold-reared lean pups had any effect in thermoneutrally reared lean pups. When +/+ pups were artificially reared from 4 to 16 days of age at thermoneutrality and treated as before with leptin from day 7, their total metabolic rate throughout the treatment period was only 4% higher than that of the control littermates and their final body fat content only 4% lower (both P>0.05). We conclude from comparisons of the results in +/+ pups at cold and thermoneutral conditions that leptin does not stimulate, but rather disinhibits, sympathetically mediated thermoregulatory thermogenesis.

TI  - Serotonergic modulation of hippocampal pyramidal cells in euthermic, cold-acclimated, and hibernating hamsters.  
AB  - Serotonergic fibers project to the hippocampus, a brain area previously shown to have distinctive changes in electroencephalograph (EEG) activity during entrance into and arousal from hibernation. The EEG activity is generated by pyramidal cells in both hibernating and nonhibernating species. Using the brain slice preparation, we characterized serotonergic responses of these CA1 pyramidal cells in euthermic, cold-acclimated, and hibernating Syrian hamsters. Stimulation of Shaffer-collateral/commissural fibers evoked fast synaptic excitation of CA1 pyramidal cells, a response monitored by recording population spikes (the synchronous generation of action potentials). Neuromodulation by serotonin (5-HT) decreased population spike amplitude by 54% in cold-acclimated animals, 80% in hibernating hamsters, and 63% in euthermic animals. The depression was significantly greater in slices from hibernators than from cold-acclimated animals. In slices from euthermic animals, changes in extracellular K+ concentration between 2.5 and 5.0 mM did not significantly alter serotonergic responses. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin mimicked serotonergic inhibition in euthermic hamsters. Results show that 5-HT is a robust neuromodulator not only in euthermic animals but also in cold-acclimated and hibernating hamsters.

TI  - CMV-induced anti-Sia-b1 cold agglutinin in an immunocompromised patient.  
AB  -  In postinfection cold agglutination, certain cold agglutinin (CA) specificities are associated with distinct infectious agents. The combined occurrence of anti-I and anti-Sia-b1 CAs following Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection has been reported recently. After renal transplantation and hyperacute graft rejection, transiently occurring CAs were observed in an 18-year-old boy. The CAs were characterized by serum cold absorption with sialidase-treated red cells and warm elution from the cells. An anti-Sia-b1 CA could be differentiated from an accompanying low-liter anti-I. Fresh infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, rubella, and varicella viruses were excluded, but CMV infection was demonstrated. This is the first case of a postinfection anti-Sia-b1 CA associated with CMV infection.

We demonstrate that: (i) the core cspA promoter (from -40 to +16) responds to cold shock and a mutation at -36 increases the relative activity of the promoter at low temperature by threefold; (ii) the sequences upstream of -40 have a positive effect on expression at 37 degrees C, but no effect on the cold shock response; (iii) by virtue of their influence on mRNA stability, the downstream sequences (from +81 to +165) reduce expression at 37 degrees C and increase the intensity of the cold shock response; (iv) mutations in the GCACATCA and CCAAT motifs, present at +1/-4 and between the -10 and -35 elements, respectively, do not affect the cold shock response of the cspA promoter; (v) following cold shock, a modification of the protein synthetic machinery takes place that allows preferential translation of cspA mRNA relative to the non-cold shock cat and lacZ mRNAs.

TI  - Role of Escherichia coli cspA promoter sequences and adaptation of translational apparatus in the cold shock response.  
AB  - A shift in growth temperature from 37 degrees C to 15 degrees C leads to a dramatic increase in the level of CspA, the major cold shock protein of Escherichia coli. To investigate the molecular basis of this induction, we considered the relevance of transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls by analyzing the steady-state levels of transcripts and the expression of reporter genes in cells carrying a set of cspA promoter fragments of variable length fused to lacZ or cat genes. We demonstrate that: (i) the core cspA promoter (from -40 to +16) responds to cold shock and a mutation at -36 increases the relative activity of the promoter at low temperature by threefold; (ii) the sequences upstream of -40 have a positive effect on expression at 37 degrees C, but no effect on the cold shock response; (iii) by virtue of their influence on mRNA stability, the downstream sequences (from +81 to +165) reduce expression at 37 degrees C and increase the intensity of the cold shock response; (iv) mutations in the GCACATCA and CCAAT motifs, present at +1/-4 and between the -10 and -35 elements, respectively, do not affect the cold shock response of the cspA promoter; (v) following cold shock, a modification of the protein synthetic machinery takes place that allows preferential translation of cspA mRNA relative to the non-cold shock cat and lacZ mRNAs. The quantitatively modest transcriptional activation shown by the core promoter of cspA following cold shock suggests that transcriptional activation can significantly contribute to cold shock induction only when coupled to posttranscriptional controls, such as alterations in mRNA stability and the translational apparatus.

TI  - A method for dynamic measurement of the resistance to dry heat exchange by footwear.  
AB  - Five different types of cold protective footwear have been tested with regard to their resistance to dry heat loss (i.e. the insulation) with a new electrically heated foot model. The model is able to simulate 'walking' movements in order to provide a more realistic simulation of wear conditions. Thermal insulation of shoes with and without a steel toe cap was the same. The insulating properties during simulated walking movements were 10-25% lower compared with static conditions. For two of the shoe models a significantly lower insulation value for the sole area was obtained when adding a weight of 30 kg. A significant difference could also be found between the insulation values of two different sizes of one of the models. Measurements with the standard method (EN 344) correlated well with the local insulation value of the sole part of the thermal foot. Correlation with the insulation value for the whole shoe was much less, variation was bigger and ranking in terms of cold protection differed between methods. The electrically heated foot model appears to provide a reproducible, accurate and more realistic method for measuring the insulation properties of shoes than EN 344.

TI  - [Effect of the prior influenza vaccination on serum antibody titer induction by subsequent inactivated influenza vaccine in the elderly]  
AB  - In order to investigate the effects of prior influenza vaccination on subaequent annual influenza vaccination in the geriatric population, we analyzed serum hemagglutinine inhibition antibody tirers (HI titer) before and after vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine in elderly inpatients. A total of 163 inpatients of 60 years or older were enrolled with informed consent. They were classified by vaccination status in the previous year, 53 patients had inactivated vaccine (inactivated). 52 patients had genetically assorted cold-adapted influenza live attenuated vaccine (cold-adapted), and 53 had no influenza vaccine history during the past year. The HI titer was higher in the inactivated group than in the cold-adapted and non-vaccinated groups, suggesting residual immunological effects of inactivated influenza vaccine from the previous year vaccination. The HI titer after the inactivated vaccine in 1993 was higher in both the inactivated and cold-adapted groups than in the non-vaccinated group. The number of patients with HI titers of 2(7) or higher, which is the putative protective HI titer level for influenza infection, was significantly higher in both the inactivated and cold-adapted groups than the non-vaccinated group. These results suggest that continuous annual influenza vaccination does not impair the effects of vaccination, and may actively promote elevated HI titers.

TI  - CD28-b7 blockade in organ dysfunction secondary to cold ischemia/reperfusion injury [see comments]  
AB  - Ischemic injury to cadaver organs is a major risk factor for development of chronic organ dysfunction. We have recently shown that the B7 costimulatory pathway plays a critical role in early organ dysfunction developing after renal cold ischemia/reperfusion injury. We extended these observations to investigate the role of this pathway in the development and progression of chronic organ dysfunction following such injury. Uninephrectomized rats which underwent cold ischemia/reperfusion injury developed progressive proteinuria as compared to uninephrectomized controls. Animals treated with CTLA4Ig, which blocks B7 costimulation, starting on the day of injury had significantly better long-term survival and developed significantly less proteinuria than control animals treated with control Ig. RT-PCR analysis of kidney tissue showed significant reduction in expression of activation and inflammatory cytokines, chemoattractants, and growth factors, as compared to controls. Delaying administration of CTLA4Ig for one week, but not four weeks, after injury was still effective in ameliorating development of progressive proteinuria. Interestingly, selective blockade of B7-1 by a mutant form of CTLA4Ig had no effect on early or chronic organ dysfunction. These findings indicate the long-term functional and molecular consequences of experimental cold ischemia/reperfusion injury, and suggest that B7-2 is critical in the development of organ dysfunction following ischemic injury, even in the absence of alloantigen.

TI  - [Mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemic as zoonosis]  
AB  - At a secondary school in Budapest, in the first class, 30 students became sick with fever and upper respiratory catarrhal symptoms between September 19 and October 31, 1995. Two children were hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia, in case of the two children treated at the Szent Laszlo Hospital, suspect of Mycoplasma infection raised which was also confirmed by cold agglutination test. During the epizootiological examination on the spot they found a terrarium in the classroom where the students raised a Syrian gold hamster family. Mycoplasmas were isolated from the lung samples of the hamsters during the pathological examination which proved to be Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Owing to the close etiologic relationships between epidemiological anamnesis, characteristics of the epidemic, as well as findings of patients and pathological or histological findings in the hamsters together with the results of bacteriological examinations, the epidemic should be considered as a zoonosis.

TI  -  [Cold pressed oils]  
AB  - In recent years the interest in cold pressed oils has increased. In the Polish market, besides a wide assortment of imported products, Polish oils, mainly rapeseed oil, are also ever more frequently available. Cold pressed oils are used in food and pharmaceutical industry and also in the production of cosmetics. The production of cold pressed oils is simple and the investments for it are low. A limitation of the use of this method is low efficiency of the process (6-15% of oil remains in the pressed residues). For obtaining of proper oil it is indispensable to use ripe, clean, non-damaged and correctly stored seeds. Moreover, the conditions and parameters of the production and storage are important, especially the temperature and duration of pressing. The quality of oil is reduced at higher temperatures. At the temperatures below 40 degrees C the process yields oil of good quality permitted for consumption. The quality and the durability of the obtained oil depend on many factors, among them on the composition of fatty acids, the conditions of production and storage, on the presence of prooxidants and antioxidants. The analogue of the Polish cold pressed oil may be "cold pressed oil" and "virgin oil" the definitions and properties of which were proposed at the 21st Session of the Committees for Codex Alimentarius for Fats and Oils of the FAO/WHO (London, 1993).

TI  - Control of temperature during newborn transport: an old problem with new difficulties [published erratum appears in J Paediatr Child Health 1998 Feb;34(1):108]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore any changes in temperature control during neonatal emergency inter-hospital transport between 1977 and 1996. METHODS: Records were reviewed of all infants undergoing emergency transfer by the statewide Victorian Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS). Per axillary temperatures were recorded prospectively on arrival of transport team and at conclusion of transfer for all infants. RESULTS: The rate of hypothermia (< 36.0 degrees C) when NETS reached the infant has decreased overall (22% in 1977-79 to 7% in 1995-96) and for all weight groups; although in 1995-96 hypothermia was present in 36% of infants less than 1000 g when NETS arrived. The rate of hypothermia (< 36.0 degrees C) at the end of the transfer has remained at 3% overall for many years. The rate of hyperthermia at both times has increased significantly overall (12% in 1977-79 to 24% in 1995-96 on NETS arrival, 4%-19%, respectively at end of transfer) and for all weight groups except infants less than 1000 g. The range of abnormal temperatures has not substantially changed over time. CONCLUSION: There has been significant improvement in avoidance of hypothermia and cold stress amongst infants requiring emergency neonatal transport from 1977 to 1996. However, in order to improve the number of infants transferred who achieve a temperature in the normal range the need to avoid hyperthermia is highlighted. Infants who require incubator care for optimal medical management require continual monitoring of temperature and review of environmental conditions to optimise the conditions both prior to and during transport.

AB  - We report a successful result of treatment for a ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with aortitis syndrome. A 43-year-old male suffered sudden low back pain, that was diagnosed as a ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm based on abdominal computed tomography. Preoperative angiography revealed a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, and well developed Riolan's archade. The aneurysm was replaced by a prosthetic graft with partial femoro-femoral bypass in conjunction with selective cold perfusion for the visceral arteries. Total extracorporeal circulation time, and aortic clamptime, was 187 minutes and 132 minutes, respectively. The postoperative courses of liver and renal function were excellent. The patient recovered from surgery uneventfully. It was suggested that selective cold visceral perfusion was effective for prevention of renal and liver dysfunction associated with a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the biochemical characteristics of the opioid receptors and opioid peptides in the jerboa (Jaculus orientalis) brain, a subdesert rodent of Morocco. We have demonstrated the presence of delta, mu, and kappa sites in the jerboa brain. The endogenous opioid peptides methionine-enkephalin, beta-endorphin, and dynorphin were evaluated in different physiological states of the animal (active and hibernating). The circulating methionine-enkephalin in different states of the animal (active, hibernating, exposure to cold conditions, and fasting) was evaluated in the plasma. Our results indicate that the hibernating state the opioid receptors level decreased, whereas the concentration of opioid peptides increased. These findings suggest that both opioid receptors and opioid peptides could be involved in the adaptation of the jerboa to survive under thermal stress.

TI  - Pediatric tonsillectomy: post-operative morbidity comparing microsurgical bipolar dissection versus cold sharp dissection.  
AB  - A prospective single-blinded study was conducted to compare pediatric tonsillectomy using the traditional cold sharp dissection with ligation for securing hemostasis (CSDL) versus microsurgical bipolar dissection technique (MBCT). Sixty children aged between 2 and 14 years were sequentially assigned to each group. Blood loss and postoperative pain in the first hour were markedly decreased in the MBCT group (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Average surgical time was slightly decreased in diathermy tonsillectomy (15'30") compared with the cold technique (16'30"). Return to normal diet was significantly earlier in the CSDL group (P < 0.05). Late postoperative pain measured on the tenth day showed a moderate increase in children who underwent MBCT. There was no difference between the two techniques in the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. No major complications occurred. We believe MBCT is a fast and safe technique which may be useful in children with known bleeding disorders. However, it increases late postoperative pain and, therefore, delay in patients' return to normal activities. Consequently, it does not represent a significant advantage over the traditional CSDL procedure.

While the chkYB-1HP is identical over its carboxyl-terminal 78 amino acids with the Y-box protein YB-1, it differs strikingly from all other Y-box transcription factors by lacking the cold-shock domain (CSD). We propose that proteins like chkYB-1HP that lack the CSD, but retain the hydrophilic carboxyl domain could regulate Y-box proteins through the formation of heterodimeric complexes.

AB  - Simultaneous arterial and urinary bladder pressure measurements were recorded during bladder filling in 21 patients with urinary bladder symptoms; seven patients had autonomic failure due to multiple system atrophy (MSA), seven had spinal cord disease of different aetiology with detrusor hyperreflexia (DH) and seven had no neurological abnormalities. A significant increase in average systolic blood pressure (BP) was recorded on bladder filling in the neurologically intact patients (from 110 to 137 mmHg) and in the patients with spinal cord disease and DH (from 109 to 129 mmHg). In those with MSA, the BP rose in four and fell in three patients. The vesicopressor response during cold receptor-mediated DH was not significantly higher when compared with room-temperature saline and when compared with the BP response during bladder filling in the neurologically intact patients. Finally, intravesical lignocaine retained in the bladder for 15 min did not influence the BP response to cold receptor stimulation in patients with spinal cord disease and DH. These findings and their pathophysiological and clinical implications are discussed.

TI  -  Retrograde cold blood cardioplegia. Obliteration of the posterior interventricular vein in the coronary sinus improves cooling of the left ventricle posterior wall.  
AB  - The study hypothesis was that obliteration of the posterior interventricular vein in the coronary sinus avoids the back leak of cardioplegia to the right atrium and forces cardioplegia towards the posterior wall of the left ventricle and interventricular septum. A new retrograde cardioplegia cannula with a long balloon (3 cm) was designed which obstructs the posterior interventricular vein in the coronary sinus. The hypothesis was tested by a prospective randomized study in 52 consecutive patients who underwent coronary or aortic valve surgery. In group I (n = 26), the cannula prototype was used, while a standard cannula (balloon length 8 mm) was used in group II (n = 26). The cardioplegic solution was cold blood (14 degrees C). The posterior wall temperature was recorded when the anterior wall temperature reached 15 degrees C. In group I, 91% of patients had the same temperature in the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle versus 19% in group II (P < 0.05). The mean of the difference of left ventricular temperatures between anterior and posterior walls was 0.5 degrees C (sigma = 1.7) in group I versus 8 degrees C (sigma= 4.1 ) in group II (alpha < 0.05). In group I, 9.5% of patients had a posterior wall temperature > 20 degrees C versus 81% in group II (P < 0.05). Cooling of the posterior wall of the left ventricle is better in group I than in group II. As cooling and cardioplegia flow are closely linked, obliteration of the posterior interventricular vein in the coronary sinus improves left ventricular distribution of the cardiplegia.

TI  - Cellular uptake properties of a 2'-amino/2'-O-methyl-modified chimeric hammerhead ribozyme targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA.  
AB  - Catalytic RNA or ribozymes have important potential applications as molecular biological tools in the study of gene expression and as therapeutic inhibitors of disease-causing genes. Very little is known, however, about the cellular uptake mechanisms of exogenously delivered synthetic ribozymes. In this study, we have characterized the uptake properties of a synthetic, 2'-O-methyl-modified ribozyme containing U4/U7 amino groups within the catalytic core of the hammerhead motif. The cellular uptake of the internally [32P]-radiolabeled hammerhead ribozyme in U87-MG glioma cells was temperature, energy, and pH dependent and involved an active process that could be competed with cold ribozyme of the same chemistry and sequence, an all 2'-O-methyl-modified ribozyme of the same sequence, antisense PS-ODNs, and a variety of other polyanions (salmon sperm DNA, spermidine, dextran sulfate, and heparin). Subcellular distribution studies of fluorescently labeled ribozymes confirmed an extranuclear, punctate localization similar to that observed for an endosomal marker, dextran. Our study highlights that hammerhead ribozymes, despite exhibiting a defined secondary structure, enter cells by an endocytic mechanism that appears to be similar to that reported for a variety of antisense ODNs. These observations should facilitate the development of more efficient delivery systems.

TI  - Improved contractility and coronary flow in isolated hearts after 1-day hypothermic preservation with isoflurane is not dependent on K(ATP) channel activation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isoflurane protects against reperfusion injury in isolated hearts when given before, during, and initially after hypoxia or ischemia and aids in preconditioning hearts if given before ischemia. The aims of the current study were to determine if isoflurane is cardioprotective during 1-day, severe hypothermic perfusion and if a mechanism of protection is K(ATP) channel activation. METHODS: Guinea pig hearts (n = 60) were isolated, perfused with Kreb's solution initially at 37 degrees C, and assigned to either a nontreated warm, time control group or one of five cold-treated groups: drug-free cold control, 1.3% isoflurane, 1.3% isoflurane plus glibenclamide (4 microM), 2.6% isoflurane, or 2.6% isoflurane plus glibenclamide. Isoflurane and glibenclamide were given 20 min before hypothermia, during low-flow hypothermia (3.8 degrees C) for 22 h, and for 30 min after rewarming to 37 degrees C. Heart rate, left ventricular pressure, %O2 extraction, and coronary flow were measured continuously, and responses to epinephrine, adenosine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and nitroprusside were examined before and after hypothermia. RESULTS: Each group had similar initial left ventricular pressures, coronary flows, and responses to adenosine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and nitroprusside. Before hypothermia, isoflurane with or without glibenclamide increased coronary flow while decreasing left ventricular pressure and %O2 extraction. After hypothermia, left ventricular pressure and coronary flow were reduced in all cold groups but least reduced in isoflurane-treated groups. During normothermic perfusion after isoflurane and glibenclamide, left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, and flow responses to adenosine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and nitroprusside were similarly improved in isoflurane and isoflurane-plus-glibenclamide groups over the cold control group but not to levels observed in the warm-time control group. CONCLUSION: Isoflurane, like halothane, given before, during, and initially after hypothermia markedly improved but did not restore cardiac perfusion and function. Protective effects of isoflurane were not concentration dependent and not inhibited by the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide. Volatile anesthetics have novel cardioprotective effects when given during long-term severe hypothermia.

TI  - Metabolizable energy intake and sustained energy expenditure of Alaskan sled dogs during heavy exertion in the cold.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure energy expenditures of Alaskan sled dogs at rest and during racing under frigid conditions, using the doubly labeled water (DLW) technique. ANIMALS: 18 fit Alaskan sled dogs. PROCEDURE: Energy expenditure was measured in 9 dogs during a 490-km sled dog race by use of the DLW technique, whereby dogs were administered water enriched with nonradioactive isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Energy intake was determined by dietary analysis. Changes in background abundance of the isotopes 2H and 18O were monitored in 5 dogs that did not receive isotope-enriched water. RESULTS: Dogs completed the 490-km race at an average speed of 7 km/h at ambient temperature of -35 to -10 C. Total energy expenditure, measured by the DLW technique, was 47,100 +/- 5,900 kJ/d (4,400 +/- 400 kJ.kg-0.75/d), and metabolizable energy intake was 44,600 kJ/d (4,100 kJ.kg-0.75/d) during the 70-hour race. CONCLUSIONS: The sustained metabolic rate for these sled dogs during racing was extraordinarily high for a large mammal. This study validated use of the DLW technique in dogs with exceptionally high energy expenditure associated with prolonged exercise in the cold.

TI  - Oxidative inactivation of gastric peroxidase by site-specific generation of hydroxyl radical and its role in stress-induced gastric ulceration.  
AB  - We have shown earlier that restraint-cold stress-induced gastric ulceration in rats is caused by metal ion-dependent generation of hydroxyl radical (OH.) and oxidative inactivation of the gastric peroxidase (GPO), an important H2O2 scavenging enzyme. To study the mechanism of the oxidative damage of GPO, the purified enzyme was exposed to an OH. generating system containing Cu2+, ascorbate, and H2O2. Kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme is inactivated in a time-dependent process showing saturation with respect to Cu2+ concentration. The enzyme specifically requires Cu2+ and is not inactivated by the same concentration of Fe2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+. Sensitivity to catalase indicates the critical role of H2O2 in the inactivation. Inactivation is insensitive to superoxide dismutase, suggesting no role of superoxide. The rate of inactivation is not increased in D2O excluding the involvement of singlet oxygen in the process. However, OH. scavengers such as benzoate or mannitol cannot prevent inactivation. The results indicate a plausible generation of OH. within the enzyme molecule as the cause of inactivation. Fragmentation of peptide linkage or intramolecular crosslinking, gross change of tertiary structure, or change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence which occurs in "global" oxidation are not evident. Inactivation is dependent on pH and from a plot of K(obs) of inactivation against pH, the controlling role of an ionizable group of the enzyme having a pka of 7.8 could be suggested, deprotonation of which favors inactivation. Amino acid analysis shows a specific loss of two lysine residues in the inactivated enzyme. Competitive kinetic studies indicate that pyridoxal phosphate, a specific modifier of the lysine residue, prevents inactivation by competing with Cu2+ for binding at the GPO. A Cu2+ binding motif consisting at least of two lysine residues exists in GPO, which specifically binds Cu2+ and generates OH.. The radical oxidizes the lysine residues and perturbs the heme environment to cause inactivation. We suggest that oxidative damage of GPO is mediated by site-specific generation of OH. and not by the OH. generated in the bulk phase.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus-related liver damage is related to cold activation of complement.  
AB  - A high positivity of cold activation of complement has been reported in Japanese patients having hepatitis B virus-negative chronic hepatitis. Although the cause of cold activation of complement is unknown, the involvement of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been suspected. We studied the positivity of cold activation of complement in 253 patients, including 93 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who received 6MU natural interferon-alpha per day for 24 continuous weeks. Cold activation was positive in 38% of patients with chronic hepatitis C and in 46% of patients with liver cirrhosis C. We did not detect cold activation in asymptomatic HCV carriers; patients with chronic hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis B, or alcohol-related liver damage; or in the controls. Cold activation was also negative in HCV-RNA-negative patients who responded completely to interferon-alpha, and in HCV-RNA-positive patients who responded partially whose serum alanine transaminase levels were normalized after interferon treatment. In the patients who had a relapse of hepatitis C after interferon treatment, positivity of cold activation increased sharply. We conclude that HCV-associated liver damage is related to the development of cold activation of complement. Cold activation is useful for monitoring the response to interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

TI  - Deletion analysis of cspA of Escherichia coli: requirement of the AT-rich UP element for cspA transcription and the downstream box in the coding region for its cold shock induction.  
AB  - In order to analyse the mechanism of cold shock induction of CspA, a major cold shock protein of Escherichia coli, deletion analysis of the cspA gene was carried out. It was found that (i) the AT-rich sequence (-47 to -38) upstream of the cspA -35 region may act as the UP element playing a crucial role in cspA transcription at both 37 degrees C and 15 degrees C; (ii) the unusually long 5'-UTR of the cspA mRNA has negative effects on cspA expression at 37 degrees C; and (iii) in contrast, the 5'-UTR exerts a positive effect on mRNA stabilization at low temperature. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the 14 base downstream box (DB) locating 12 bases downstream of the initiation codon of the cspA mRNA and complementary to a region near the decoding region of 16S rRNA was essential for the mRNA translation during the growth lag acclimation phase immediately after cold shock. During this phase, translation of non-cold shock gene mRNAs is blocked, since they require cold shock-specific ribosomal factors for the formation of the translation initiation complex. It is proposed that DB in cold shock mRNAs allows the formation of a stable initiation complex at low temperature in the absence of the cold shock ribosomal factors.

TI  - Analysis of the reconstructibility and noise properties of scattered photons in 99mTc SPECT.  
AB  - Since scattered photons carry degraded spatial information, scatter is typically considered a source of contamination in SPECT. However, with the advent of scatter modelling methods and reconstruction-based scatter compensation (RBSC), it may be possible to utilize scattered data in a productive manner. In this work we analyse the reconstructibility of scattered photon projection data and investigate the potential for using scattered photons to reduce the noise levels of SPECT images. We have simulated projection data for an elliptical phantom containing three cold rods in a uniform background of 99mTc activity. A variety of photopeak and scatter energy windows were formed, as well as corresponding RBSC transfer matrices. Each statistically weighted matrix was decomposed using SVD and analysed in terms of reconstructibility and noise properties. Results indicate that scattered photons contain sufficient information to reconstruct the source activity, but the scatter-only matrices are very poorly conditioned. We have also evaluated several methods of utilizing scattered events via RBSC, and compared them with other, idealized methods of handling scatter. It was found that scattered photons can be used productively when photopeak and non-photopeak data are separated through the use of multiple energy windows. The RBSC methods outperformed ideal scatter subtraction, but fell short of methods which assume perfect discrimination between scattered and primary events. The knowledge gained by this study may help guide future research and lead to better approaches to handling scatter in SPECT.

TI  -  A cold-adapted lipase of an Alaskan psychrotroph, Pseudomonas sp. strain B11-1: gene cloning and enzyme purification and characterization.  
AB  - A psychrotrophic bacterium producing a cold-adapted lipase upon growth at low temperatures was isolated from Alaskan soil and identified as a Pseudomonas strain. The lipase gene (lipP) was cloned from the strain and sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene (924 bp) corresponded to a protein of 308 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 33,714. LipP also has consensus motifs conserved in other cold-adapted lipases, i.e., Lipase 2 from Antarctic Moraxella TA144 (G. Feller, M. Thirty, J. L. Arpigny, and C. Gerday, DNA Cell Biol. 10:381-388, 1991) and the mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase (D. Langin, H. Laurell, L. S. Holst, P. Belfrage, and C. Holm, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:4897-4901, 1993): a pentapeptide, GDSAG, containing the putative active-site serine and an HG dipeptide. LipP was purified from an extract of recombinant Escherichia coli C600 cells harboring a plasmid coding for the lipP gene. The enzyme showed a 1,3-positional specificity toward triolein. p-Nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids with short to medium chains (C4 and C6) served as good substrates. The enzyme was stable between pH 6 and 9, and the optimal pH for the enzymatic hydrolysis of tributyrin was around 8. The activation energies for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate and p-nitrophenyl laurate were determined to be 11.2 and 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively, in the temperature range 5 to 35 degrees C. The enzyme was unstable at temperatures higher than 45 degrees C. The Km of the enzyme for p-nitrophenyl butyrate increased with increases in the assay temperature. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+ but was not affected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and bisnitrophenyl phosphate. Various water-miscible organic solvents, such as methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, at concentrations of 0 to 30% (vol/vol) activated the enzyme.

TI  - Role of conventional ultrasonography and color flow-doppler sonography in predicting malignancy in 'cold' thyroid nodules [see comments]  
AB  - The aim of the present study was to establish the usefulness of conventional thyroid ultrasonography (US) and color flow-doppler (CFD) sonography in the assessment of 'cold' thyroid nodules. One hundred and four consecutive patients with thyroid nodules who were to undergo surgery were examined by US and CFD before thyroidectomy. Conventional US evaluated the presence of a halo sign, hypoechogenicity and microcalcifications. The vascular pattern on CFD was classified as follows: Type I, absence of blood flow; Type II, perinodular blood flow; Type III, marked intranodular blood flow. On histology, 30 nodules were diagnosed as malignant (carcinoma, CA) and 74 as benign nodules (BN). On US, the echographic pattern most predictive for malignancy was absent halo sign, which was found in 20/30 CA and in 17/72 BN (P = 0.0001; specificity 77.0%; sensitivity 66.6%). The most specific combination on US, absent halo sign/microcalcifications, was found in 8/30 CA and in 5/74 BN (P < 0.005; specificity 93.2%, sensitivity 26.6%). The Type III pattern on CFD was found in 20/30 CA and 38/74 BN (not statistically significant). The combination of absent halo sign on US with Type III pattern on CFD was found in 15/30 CA and in 8/74 BN (P < 0.0001; specificity 89.0%, sensitivity 50.0%). The combination of absent halo sign/microcalcifications on US with Type III pattern on CFD was the most specific combination of the two techniques, being found in 5/30 CA and in only 2/74 BN (P < 0.01; specificity 97.2%, sensitivity 16.6%). In conclusion, findings on US and CFD become highly predictive for malignancy only when multiple signs are simultaneously present in a thyroid nodule. Thus the predictive value of these techniques increases at the expense of their sensitivity. Only in a small proportion of patients with thyroid carcinoma is US and CFD information highly predictive of malignancy.

TI  - A multi-laboratory evaluation of in vitro platelet assays: the tests for extent of shape change and response to hypotonic shock. Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion Working Party of the International Society of Blood Transfusion.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding the use of specific in vitro tests for the assessment of the quality of platelet components. A literature review found that the platelet discoid shape as measured photometrically by the extent of shape change (ESC) and hypotonic shock response (HSR) correlated well with in vivo viability. The purpose of this study was to determine whether multiple research laboratories can perform the ESC and HSR assays in an accurate, reproducible manner, with acceptable sensitivity and comparable results. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven laboratories conducted five identical experiments, each with a different unit of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). For each experiment, 2 half-units of PRP were prepared and stored overnight: 1 half-unit at 20 to 24 degrees C in CPD (CPD-PRP) and the other at 1 to 6 degrees C with 2 mg per mL of EDTA (cold EDTA-PRP) added to produce spherical platelets with reduced HSR. Platelet suspensions having different proportions of the two PRPs were prepared and evaluated in duplicate by ESC and HSR assays, and morphologically scored by microscopy. One-way ANOVA and Duncan multiple-range tests were performed to determine significant differences in assay results for suspensions having different proportions of CPD-PRP. RESULTS: Comparable ESC (mean range: 20-28% for CPD-PRP and 1-6% for cold EDTA-PRP) and HSR (mean range: 58-81% for CPD-PRP and 12-31% for cold EDTA-PRP) measurements were obtained by nine laboratories. Duplicate testing showed high reproducibility of ESR and HSR results /in all laboratories. A 25-percent difference in the proportion of CPD-PRP (indicative of a difference of approximately 25% in the proportions of discoid and spherical platelets) was detected with a sample size of five (p<0.05) for both the ESC and HSR assays. A high correlation was found for the ESC assay and morphology score (r = 0.93, n = 345). CONCLUSION: Multiple laboratories were able to obtain comparable results with the ESC and HSR tests. They were able to show that the tests can be performed in an accurate, reproducible manner and with acceptable sensitivity.

TI  - Retrograde coronary perfusion: effects on iatrogenic edema and diastolic properties [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative merits of antegrade infusion and retrograde infusion of cardioplegic solution in terms of heart weight, myocardial water content, and ventricular diastolic properties are undefined. Accordingly, we compared antegrade and retrograde flow of hemodiluted blood in isolated, hypothermic porcine hearts. METHODS: After cardiectomy, 1 L of cold heparinized blood diluted with lactated Ringer's solution to concentrations ranging from 100% lactated Ringer's to 50% lactated Ringer's and 50% blood was perfused in an antegrade (n = 6) or retrograde (n = 6) fashion at mean pressures of 62 +/- 2 mm Hg (+/- standard error of the mean) and 49 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. Heart weight, myocardial water content, and left ventricular pressure-volume relationships were obtained before and after perfusion. RESULTS: In the comparison of measurements before and after perfusion, changes in heart weight (36 +/- 4 g versus 5 +/- 2 g; p < 0.05), myocardial water content (6.9% +/- 1.0% versus 2.5% +/- 0.4%; p < 0.01), and ventricular filling measured by normalized left ventricular volume at 10, 15, and 20 mm Hg were greater in the antegrade group. CONCLUSIONS: In the isolated porcine heart, retrograde flow is distinguished from antegrade flow by less change in heart weight and myocardial water content and no diastolic dysfunction.

TI  - Winter mortality and cold stress in Yekaterinburg, Russia: interview survey.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how mortality and protective measures against exposure to cold change as temperatures fall between October and March in a region of Russia with a mean winter temperature below -6 degrees C. DESIGN: Interview to assess factors associated with cold stress both indoors and outdoors, to measure temperatures in living room, and to survey unheated rooms. SETTING: Sverdlovsk Oblast (district), Yekaterinburg, Russia. SUBJECTS: Residents aged 50-59 and 65-74 living within approximately 140 km of Yekaterinburg in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Survey of sample of 1000 residents equally distributed by sex and age groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regression analysis was used to relate data on indoor heating and temperatures, the amount of clothing worn, the amount of physical activity, and shivering while outside, to outdoor temperature; results were compared with mortality patterns for ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mortality from all causes. RESULTS: As mean daily temperatures fell to 0 degree C the amount of clothing worn outdoors increased, physical activity while outdoors became more continuous, and only 11 (6.6%) of the 167 people surveyed who went outdoors at temperatures above 0 degree C reported shivering. The mean temperature in living rooms in the evening remained above 21.9 degrees C. Mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and all causes did not change. As the temperature fell below 0 degree C the number of items of clothing worn plateaued at 16.0 and the number of layers at 3.7. With regression analysis, shivering outdoors was found to increase progressively to 34.6% (P < 0.001) of excursions at -25 degrees C, and mortality (after declining slightly) rose progressively (all cause mortality rose by 1.15% for each 1 degree C drop in temperature from 0 degree C to -29.6 degrees C, 95% confidence interval 0.97% to 1.32%). 94.2% of bedrooms were directly heated, and evening temperatures in the living room averaged 19.8 degrees C even when outside temperatures reached -25 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Outdoor cold stress and mortality in Yekaterinburg increased only when the mean daily temperature dropped below 0 degree C. At temperatures down to 0 degree C cold stress and excess mortality were prevented by increasing the number of items of clothing worn and the amount of physical activity outdoors in combination with maintaining warmth in houses.

AB  - CONTEXT: The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with antibiotic use. Children receive a significant proportion of the antibiotics prescribed each year and represent an important target group for efforts aimed at reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antibiotic-prescribing practices for children younger than 18 years who had received a diagnosis of cold, upper respiratory tract infection (URI), or bronchitis in the United States. DESIGN: Representative national survey of practicing physicians participating in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey conducted in 1992 with a response rate of 73%. SETTING: Office-based physician practices. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians completing patient record forms for patients younger than 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Principal diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS: A total of 531 pediatric office visits were recorded that included a principal diagnosis of cold, URI, or bronchitis. Antibiotics were prescribed to 44% of patients with common colds, 46% with URIs, and 75% with bronchitis. Extrapolating to the United States, 6.5 million prescriptions (12% of all prescriptions for children) were written for children diagnosed as having a URI or nasopharyngitis (common cold), and 4.7 million (9% of all prescriptions for children) were written for children diagnosed as having bronchitis. After controlling for confounding factors, antibiotics were prescribed more often for children aged 5 to 11 years than for younger children (odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.33) and rates were lower for pediatricians than for nonpediatricians (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.92). Children aged 0 to 4 years received 53% of all antibiotic prescriptions, and otitis media was the most frequent diagnosis for which antibiotics were prescribed (30% of all prescriptions). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescribing for children diagnosed as having colds, URIs, and bronchitis, conditions that typically do not benefit from antibiotics, represents a substantial proportion of total antibiotic prescriptions to children in the United States each year.

TI  - Effect of repeated cold stress on capsaicin-evoked release of glutamate from rat spinal dorsal horn slices.  
AB  - We investigated the effect of repeated cold stress (RCS) on the capsaicin-evoked release of glutamate from the primary afferent fibers of the rat, and compared this with the effect of inoculation of complete Freund's adjuvant (adjuvant inoculation). The release of glutamate was measured using a fluorometric on-line continuous monitoring system in which the immobilized glutamate dehydrogenase column was connected to an in vitro superfusion system. In the presence of 0.3 microM tetrodotoxin, the application of 1 microM capsaicin to spinal dorsal horn slices evoked glutamate release (18.6 +/- 1.2 pmol mg(-1) protein, n = 11). In rats subjected to RCS (RCS rats), the release of glutamate evoked by 1 microM capsaicin was markedly increased to 272% (n = 6, P < 0.05) of the value for the control group, although the basal release was not significantly altered (n = 6, P > 0.05). Adjuvant inoculation produced a significant increase in the basal and capsaicin (1 microM) evoked release of glutamate to 141 and 344% (n = 6, P < 0.05) of the value for the control group, respectively. The present results suggest that the facilitated release of glutamate from capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent terminals in the spinal dorsal horn is, at least in part, involved in the hyperalgesia of RCS rats as well as the complete Freund's adjuvant-induced hyperalgesia.

TI  - Inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes on cold-smoked salmon by nisin and carbon dioxide atmosphere.  
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal effect of nisin in combination with carbon dioxide, NaCl and low temperature on the survival of Listeria monocytogenes was investigated in in vitro model studies and in trials with cold-smoked salmon. Addition of nisin caused various degrees of inhibition and sometimes death of L. monocytogenes in model experiments performed at 10 degrees C. The antilisterial effect of nisin was improved in the presence of 100% CO2 and increasing NaCl concentrations (0.5 to 5.0% w/v). Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of nisin varied from 30 to more than 500 IU/ml. The most pronounced effect of nisin was found when 10(2) cfu/ml was grown in media with 5.0% NaCl and incubated in CO2 atmosphere (MBC = 30 IU/ml). The bactericidal effect of nisin was reduced in air and vacuum, and did not increase systematically with increasing NaCl concentrations. In general, nisin concentration < or = 50 IU/ml resulted in the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes in all combinations with other preservatives (NaCl, CO2). Addition of nisin (500 or 1000 IU/g) to cold-smoked salmon inoculated with L. monocytogenes and stored at 5 degrees C delayed, but did not prevent growth of L. monocytogenes in vacuum-packs. Numbers of L. monocytogenes increased to 10(8) cfu/g in vacuum packed cold-smoked salmon in 8 days, whereas CO2 packing of cold-smoked salmon resulted in an 8-day lag phase of L. monocytogenes, with numbers eventually reaching 10(6) cfu/g in 27 days. Addition of nisin to CO2 packed cold-smoked salmon resulted in a 1 to 2 log reduction of L. monocytogenes followed by a lag phase of 8 and 20 days in salmon with 500 and 1000 IU nisin/g, respectively. The levels of L. monocytogenes remained below 10(3) cfu/g during 27 days of storage at both concentrations of nisin.

TI  - p53-dependent induction of WAF1 by cold shock in human glioblastoma cells.  
AB  - Induction of WAF1 expression was investigated in human glioblastoma cell lines differing in p53 gene statuses after cold shock treatment. Accumulation of both wild-type (wt) and mutant p53 (mp53) was induced by cold shock at 4 degrees C for 60 min, however, WAF1 accumulation was induced by cold shock in A-172 cells carrying the wtp53 but not in T98G cells carrying the mp53. Inactivation of wtp53 by a dominant negative p53 mutant (p53Trp248) abolished cold shock-induced WAF1 expression in A-172 transfectant cells. Furthermore, no WAF1 expression was induced by cold shock in p53-deficient human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. Northern blot analysis showed that the WAF1 but not p53 gene was activated by cold shock only in A-172 cells. These findings suggest that WAF1 expression is cold shock-inducible in human glioblastoma cells, and that this induction may be due to signal transduction mediated by p53 in response to non-genotoxic stress, cold shock.

TI  - Role of digital artery adrenoceptors in Raynaud's disease.  
AB  - Raynaud's disease is characterized by excessive cutaneous vasoconstriction in response to ambient cold. A functional disturbance in the local regulation of digital vasomotion has been proposed. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an alteration in the postjunctional adrenergic receptors in the digital circulation of patients with Raynaud's disease. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether this abnormality was responsible for the excessive cold-induced vasoconstriction in these patients. Finger blood flow was measured by strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography in 10 patients with Raynaud's disease and in 10 normal volunteers in a 22 degrees C room. Measurements of finger blood flow and mean systemic arterial pressure were made during intra-arterial infusions of the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, or the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, at room temperature and during local cooling of the hand. Basal finger blood flow in normal subjects was significantly greater than that of patients (8.6 +/- 2.7 vs 1.7 +/- 0.5 ml/100 ml per min; normal vs Raynaud's subjects; p < 0.05). In normal subjects, either prazosin or yohimbine induced dose-dependent increases in finger blood flow. The maximal increase in finger blood flow induced by prazosin was significantly greater than that in response to yohimbine (29.2 +/- 10.1 vs 2.8 +/- 2.1 ml/100 ml per min; prazosin vs yohimbine; p < 0.05). By contrast, in the Raynaud's patients, prazosin or yohimbine induced maximal increases in finger blood flow that were not significant (7.1 +/- 1.8 vs 5.0 +/- 2.2 ml/100 ml per min; prazosin vs yohimbine; p = NS). The response to prazosin in Raynaud's patients was significantly less than that of the normal volunteers (p < 0.05). In normal subjects, during intra-arterial infusion of vehicle alone, cooling induced a 52.6 +/- 5.8% reduction in finger blood flow. This cold-induced vasoconstriction was blunted, but not qualitatively altered, by either adrenergic antagonist. In the Raynaud's patients, during the intra-arterial infusion of the vehicle, cooling induced a 68.2 +/- 7.8% reduction in finger blood flow. Infusion of either adrenergic antagonist blunted, but did not qualitatively alter, the response to cold. Finger blood flow is less in patients with Raynaud's disease than in normal subjects when studied in a 22 degrees C room. In normal subjects, postjunctional alpha 1-adrenergic receptors appear to predominate in the control of digital vasoconstriction. Postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors play an equal role in adrenergic regulation of finger blood flow in patients with Raynaud's disease. In both normal and Raynaud's subjects, selective antagonism of alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic receptors does not abolish local cold-induced vasoconstriction. Therefore, it is likely that a nonadrenergic mechanism contributes to local cold-induced vasoconstriction.

TI  - On the cutaneous receptors contributing to withdrawal reflex pathways in the decerebrate spinal rat.  
AB  - Previous studies indicate that the withdrawal reflex system in the rat has a "modular" organization, each reflex pathway performing a specific sensorimotor transformation. Here, we wished to clarify which cutaneous receptors contribute to this system and to determine whether there are differences in this respect between reflex pathways of different muscles. Withdrawal reflexes of the peroneus longus, extensor digitorum longus, and semitendinosus muscles were recorded with EMG techniques during high reflex excitability in decerebrate spinal rats (n=26). While maintained innocuous pressure on glabrous skin could elicit a sustained reflex activity in all muscles studied, vibration of glabrous skin (10-300 Hz) always failed to evoke a reflex response, suggesting that slowly adapting, but not rapidly adapting, low-threshold mechanoreceptive fibers from this type of skin contribute to withdrawal reflex pathways. Thermal stimulation in the innocuous range, i.e., cooling from 32 to 17 degrees C, or warming the skin from 32 to 41 degrees C, always failed to produce reflex responses, indicating that neither cold nor warm receptors contribute to withdrawal reflex pathways. When either cooling or warming the skin to the noxious temperatures of 1 degrees C or above 45 degrees C, respectively, a reflex discharge was often evoked in the muscles studied. Intradermal administration of histamine, a potent pruritogenic substance, produced very weak, or no, reflex response. In contrast, mustard oil produced vigorous reflex responses in all muscles studied. These findings suggest that some chemonociceptors contribute only weakly, or not at all, to withdrawal reflex pathways. The present data suggest that a selective set of cutaneous receptors contribute to withdrawal reflex pathways and that different withdrawal reflex pathways receive input from essentially the same cutaneous receptor types.

TI  - Evidence for the cell wall involvement in temporal changes in freezing tolerance of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) tubers during cold acclimation.  
AB  - We studied the mechanism of cold acclimation of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) tubers with special reference to the role of the cell wall. During the cold-acclimation process from September to January, the freezing tolerance of tubers increased from -2.8 degrees C to -8.4 degrees C (LT50). By contrast, the isolated protoplasts constitutively showed a consistent high level of freezing tolerance (LT50; below -25 degrees C) throughout the period. In tuber tissues, freezing injury was effectively protected by the external addition of isotonic solutions. Cryomicroscopic observations revealed that tissue cells mounted in isotonic solutions plasmolyzed upon freezing; tissue cells mounted in water collapsed with a tight attachment of plasma membrane to the cell wall. Upon freezing of intact tissues in water to temperatures below the critical range, the cytoplasm was irreversibly acidified as revealed by a fluorescence pH-ratiometry, suggesting that occurrence of detrimental cellular events leading to permanent cell injury. The freeze-induced acidification of cytoplasm was also effectively prevented by the external addition of isotonic solutions. These results suggest that the tight attachment of the plasma membrane to the cell wall during freezing may have a harmful effect on cells, in particular on the plasma membrane, possibly due to mechanical or some sort of chemical/ physico-chemical interaction with the cell wall.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the results of a microbiological analysis of food prepared in high-risk communal dining-rooms, in order to establish the degree of contamination, analyze the causes of this contamination, and improve the health standards of these establishments. METHODS: Descriptive, observational study with data obtained from a health inspection on 44 high-risk communal dining-rooms, which included the microbiological analysis of 90 foods, as well as the health inspection of the establishments. RESULTS: In schools mesophil micro-organisms were the most frequent contaminants; in kindergardens and homes for the elderly deficient hygiene standards were predominant in the handling of food. A greater proportion of mesophil micro-organisms were to be found during the cold months than in warmer months. Deficient hygiene indicators appeared generally in the case of food prepared in establishments in which deficiencies were observed. Psychrotrophes were not found in any of the food samples collected in kindergartens but were found in schools and homes for the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates which problems predominate in each type of high-risk communal dining-room. Mesophils appeared in food prepared in large-scale kitchens, deficient hygiene standards were found to be associated to handling of food by non-professional staff and substandard establishments, and psychrotrophes were detected in establishments which kept left-overs. Recommendations were made as to how to eliminate the problems detected.

TI  - The use of fine needle aspiration biopsy in the management of thyroid disease.  
AB  - Fine needle aspiration biopsy is now a first line investigation in thyroid disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of this technique in comparison with routine histopathology. A total of 593 aspirations over a four year period were included. There were 390 (65.7%) solitary nodules, 124 (20.9%) multinodular goiters, 66 (11.1%) diffuse goitres and 13 (2.2%) recurrent post thyroidectomy nodules. Radioisotope scanning in 386 cases showed 325 (84.2%) cold nodules, 54 (14.0%) warm nodules and 7 (1.8%) hot nodules. There were 458 (77.2%) colloid goitres and cysts, 14 cases of thyroiditis (2.2%) and 30 malignancies diagnosed on fine needle aspiration biopsy. In 19 cases (3.2%) a diagnosis of follicular neoplasm and in 29 cases (4.9%) a diagnosis of suspicious aspirate was made. Histological results were available in 176 cases. In 108 cases findings of histology and FNAB were compared with radioisotope scanning. A sensitivity of 92.8% and 42.8%, a specificity of 90.1% and 98.7% and accuracy index of 90.3% and 94.3% was found, when considering suspicious cases alternatively as positives and negatives. Surgery was recommended in all suspicious cases to prevent reduction in sensitivity of the technique. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was found to be a highly effective procedure which can obviate a lot of unnecessary surgery in thyroid lesions.

TI  - Cold-induced thermoregulation and biological aging.  
AB  - Aging is associated with diminished cold-induced thermoregulation (CIT). The mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon have yet to be clearly elucidated but most likely reflect a combination of increased heat loss and decreased metabolic heat production. The inability of the aged subject to reduce heat loss during cold exposure is associated with diminished reactive tone of the cutaneous vasculature and, to a lesser degree, alterations in the insulative properties of body fat. Cold-induced metabolic heat production via skeletal muscle shivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue nonshivering thermogenesis appears to decline with age. Few investigations have directly linked diminished skeletal muscle shivering thermogenesis with the age-related reduction in cold-induced thermoregulatory capacity. Rather, age-related declines in skeletal muscle mass and metabolic activity are cited as evidence for decreased heat production via shivering. Reduced mass, GDP binding to brown fat mitochondria, and uncoupling protein (UCP) levels are cited as evidence for attenuated brown adipose tissue cold-induced nonshivering thermogenic capacity during aging. The age-related reduction in brown fat nonshivering thermogenic capacity most likely reflects altered cellular signal transduction rather than changes in neural and hormonal signaling. The discussion in this review focuses on how alterations in CIT during the life span may offer insight into possible mechanisms of biological aging. Although the preponderance of evidence presented here demonstrates that CIT declines with chronological time, the mechanism reflecting this attenuated function remains to be elucidated. The inability to draw definitive conclusions regarding biological aging and CIT reflects the lack of a clear definition of aging. It is unlikely that the mechanisms accounting for the decline in cold-induced thermoregulation during aging will be determined until biological aging is more precisely defined.

Following a month laser therapy, it did not cause no activation of lipid peroxidative processes, significant changes in the organization of a cell membrane lipid bilayer, or any profound cardiac performance abnormalities, which gives grounds to state that laser radiation exerts membrane-stabilizing and antistress effects. The findings suggest that laser therapy should be used in coronary heart disease patients having a functional component of coronary insufficiency.

TI  - The impact of water temperature on core body temperature of North American river otters (Lutra canadensis) during simulated oil spill recovery washing protocols.  
AB  - Ten North American river otters (Lutra canadensis) were anesthetized with Telazol and instrumented with ingestable radiotelemetry temperature sensors for measuring core body temperature. The otters were then subjected to a washing protocol to simulate rehabilitation following an oil spill contamination. This protocol consisted of a 30-min wash in a 1:16 dilution of dishwashing liquid using either cold (24 degrees C) water or water near baseline core body temperature (38.4 degrees C), followed by a 30-min rinse with water of the same temperature, followed by 10 min of forced hot air drying. Core body temperatures of the otters washed in cold water fell at a median rate of 0.1 degrees C/min, whereas otters washed in warm water maintained stable core temperatures until the completion of the protocol, at which time their core temperatures began to drop at a similar rate. Core temperatures restabilized in both groups, and no statistical difference in core temperature between groups remained 180 min after initiation of the protocol. Efforts to examine the efficacy of supplemental squalene administration to speed the recovery of fur condition and waterproofing were unsuccessful because the washing protocol did not cause loss of coat waterproofing in 8 of the 10 subjects.

TI  - [Effects of phenylalanine and tyrosine on cold acclimation in mice]  
AB  - The effects of phenylalanine (PHE) and tyrosine (TYR) on cold acclimation were studied in mice of the ddY strain. At 5 weeks of age, mice were maintained at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. Test groups of mice were supplied with a 0.05% (w/v) solution of PHE or TYR as drinking water in addition to water. We measured changes in body weight, intake of water and food, rectal temperature upon acute exposure to -20 degrees C, weight of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and 3H-butyrate in the blood prior to and after exposure to the lower temperature of -20 degrees C. Chronic exposure to cold (4 degrees C) reduced body-weight gain for the first two weeks but weight gain recovered within the next two weeks. PHE and TYR partially inhibited the gain in body weight under exposing to cold. TYR reduced the gain of body weight under room temperature. Exposure to cold stimulated the daily consumption of food. Both PHE and TYR somewhat enhanced the food intake when exposed to cold. Exposure to cold rendered mice resistant to severe cold (-20 degrees C). Both PHE and TYR did not reduce this resistance except in the early state in the case of TYR. Exposure to cold increased the weight of BAT but both PHE and TYR prevented this increase. The effect of TYR was determined in the case fed under room temperature. Cold exposure changed the utilization of glucose, NEFA and 3H-butyrate in the blood when exposed to severe cold (-20 degrees C). Both PHE and TYR prevented the change in NEFA. It remains to be confirmed whether the growth of brown adipocytes is always necessary when mice acclimate to cold.

TI  - Cold-induced coronary Raynaud's phenomenon in patients with systemic sclerosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiac involvement with myocardial-band necrosis is common in systemic sclerosis. One possible explanation is that an underlying vasomotor abnormality accounts for these histologic findings. To shed light on this issue we investigated the existence of "myocardial Raynaud's phenomenon" in such patients. METHODS: We examined 25 patients with systemic sclerosis and 14 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, using cold pressor and dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with systemic sclerosis and 13 patients with lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis had normal perfusion during dipyridamole imaging. Seven scleroderma patients with normal dipyridamole test presented cold-induced transient myocardial ischemia, while none of the control patients had cold-induced ischemia (p = 0.034). All patients with cold-induced ischemic defects presented long-standing Raynaud's phenomenon (> 5 years); of the 14 patients with long-standing Raynaud's phenomenon 7 presented ischemic thallium-201 defects; of the remaining 9 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon of short duration (< 5 years) none presented cold-induced ischemia (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Patients with systemic sclerosis and long-standing Raynaud's phenomenon, even in the presence of normal myocardial perfusion during pharmacological vasodilation with dipyridamole, may present cold-induced myocardial ischemia, a functional Raynaud's phenomenon of the heart.

TI  - Metabolic monitoring during continuous warm- and cold-blood cardioplegia by means of myocardial tissue pH and PO2.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the changes in myocardial tissue pH and PO2 during cold- and warm-blood cardioplegic arrests. DESIGN: An experimental study in dogs. METHODS: Nine dogs underwent the following procedures: 30 minutes with an empty heart beating under cardiopulmonary bypass (control period); 30 minutes of warm (33 degrees C) cardioplegic arrest with a 1:4 mix of crystalloid in blood solution administered continuously at 150 mL/min; 30 minutes of cold (15 degrees C) cardioplegic arrest; and 30 minutes of myocardial reperfusion. The cardioplegic blood solution was administered antegradely through the ascending aorta. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tissue pH and PO2. Arterial and coronary sinus oxygen content and myocardial consumption calculated. RESULTS: There was a modest but significant increase in the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (Cx) tissue pH throughout the experiment. PmO2 in the LAD territory averaged 44 (7) mm Hg (mean and standard error of the mean) during the bypass period, 123 (23) mm Hg at the termination of warm cardioplegic arrest, 146 (28) mm Hg at the end of cold arrest and 66 (17) mm Hg after reperfusion. Oxygen consumption averaged 0.65 (0.15) mL/min during the bypass period, 0.3 (0.18) mL/min at the end of warm arrest, 0.25 (0.16) mL/min at the end of cold arrest and 0.45 (0.08) mL/min after reperfusion (p < 0.05). Oxygen delivery to the LAD territory was greater than myocardial oxygen consumption by an average of 2.02 (0.4) mL/min during bypass, 2.02 (0.62) mL/min after warm arrest, 2.12 (0.5) mL/min after cold arrest and 1.55 (0.25) mL/min after reperfusion (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During cardioplegic arrest, tissue PO2 increased and oxygen consumption decreased significantly, whereas tissue pH remained normal, suggesting that continuous warm- and cold-blood cardioplegia maintained aerobic glycolysis during myocardial arrest. Thus, the increase in myocardial tissue PmO2 during cardioplegic arrest reflects the decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption while maintaining oxygen supply.

TI  - Characterization of a gene for spinach CAP160 and expression of two spinach cold-acclimation proteins in tobacco.  
AB  - The cDNA sequence for CAP160, an acidic protein previously linked with cold acclimation in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), was characterized and found to encode a novel acidic protein of 780 amino acids having very limited homology to a pair of Arabidopsis thaliana stress-regulated proteins, rd29A and rd29B. The lack of similarity in the structural organization of the spinach and Arabidopsis genes highlights the absence of a high degree of conservation of this cold-stress gene across taxonomic boundaries. The protein has several unique motifs that may relate to its function during cold stress. Expression of the CAP160 mRNA was increased by low-temperature exposure and water stress in a manner consistent with a probable function during stresses that involve dehydration. The coding sequences for CAP160 and CAP85, another spinach cold-stress protein, were introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) under the control of the 35S promoter using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-based transformation. Tobacco plants expressing the proteins individually or coexpressing both proteins were evaluated for relative freezing-stress tolerance. The killing temperature for 50% of the cells of the transgenic plants was not different from that of the wild-type plants. As determined by a more sensitive time/temperature kinetic study, plants expressing the spinach proteins had slightly lower levels of electrolyte leakage than wild-type plants, indicative of a small reduction of freezing-stress injury. Clearly, the heterologous expression of two cold-stress proteins had no profound influence on stress tolerance, a result that is consistent with the quantitative nature of cold-stress-tolerance traits.

TI  - Identification of pseudomonads from fresh and chill-stored chicken carcasses.  
AB  - Results of carbon source assimilation tests (17 carbon compounds) led to 88% of pseudomonads from cold-stored chicken carcasses being assigned to one of 17 groups. Of these groups, 13 had combinations of properties identical to, or with readily recognizable degrees of similarity to those of published species/biovars. Two of the four groups having carbon assimilation patterns dissimilar to any known species had cellular fatty acid composition corresponding to Pseudomonas fluorescens, and two to Pseudomonas lundensis or Pseudomonas fragi. The P. fluorescens biovars all had higher amounts of 16:1 cis 9 (21-37%) and 18:1 cis 11 (10-19%), than of 17:0 cyclo (1-17%) and 19:0 cyclo (0-1%). In contrast, for P. lundensis and P. fragi, the relative amounts of these unsaturated acids and cyclopropane acids were reversed. Both the carbon source assimilation tests and the cellular fatty acid composition led to the conclusion that none of the species were dominant, although the P. fluorescens biovars constituted about 50% of the isolated pseudomonads.

TI  - Gentle in situ liver manipulation during organ harvest decreases survival after rat liver transplantation: role of Kupffer cells.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of primary graft nonfunction and dysfunction is unknown but most likely involves Kupffer cell-dependent reperfusion injury. However, the donor operation and surgical technique may also have an effect on the outcome after transplantation. Because liver manipulation during harvest cannot be prevented completely with standard procedures, its effect on survival was assessed here. METHODS: Donor livers were harvested from female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-230 g). Briefly, after minimal dissection during the first 12 min, livers were either manipulated gently or left alone for 13 subsequent minutes. At 25 min, all livers were perfused with cold University of Wisconsin solution via the portal vein, and transplantation was performed after cold storage (1 hr). In some rats, Kupffer cells were destroyed with gadolinium chloride or inactivated with dietary glycine before harvest. Survival, proteolytic activity in the rinse effluent, serum transaminases, trypan blue distribution to index microcirculation, and histology were compared. RESULTS: In the nonmanipulated group, survival was 100% after transplantation; however, gentle manipulation decreased survival by 70%. Further, manipulation elevated transaminases fivefold and caused about 200% necrosis. At harvest, proteolytic activity and the time for trypan blue to distribute homogeneously were elevated three- to eightfold by manipulation. Gadolinium chloride and glycine prevented the effects of manipulation on all parameters studied. CONCLUSION: These data indicate for the first time that brief, gentle manipulation of the donor liver has a marked detrimental effect on survival by priming or activating Kupffer cells. This may represent an important early event in pathogenesis, because Kupffer cells play an important role in primary graft nonfunction.

Cold maceration method of extraction using 95% ethanol was used for the extraction of the active constituents of the leaves. Filter paper disks which were 6 mm in diameter were used for sensitivity testing. Results showed that the extracts from the leaves of the three plants have some antimicrobial properties against the test organisms which suggest their future possible commercial therapeutic use, although this is a preliminary study.

TI  - Abeta-fiber mediated activation of cingulate cortex as correlate of central post-stroke pain.  
AB  - A patient is presented who suffered a lateral brainstem infarction which selectively abolished pain and temperature sensitivity in the lower right limb. One year later central post-stroke pain had developed in the affected limb with touch and cold allodynia. P40m dipoles calculated from magnetoencephalographic fields after electrical stimulation of both tibial nerves were localized in SI as is seen in normal subjects. However, stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large N80m component, best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate cortex. This early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral Abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal projection. Abnormal link to the pain system may be due to sensitization and reorganization above the level of nociceptive deafferentation.

AB  - In addition to patient history and clinical examination, the basis of thyroid diagnosis consists of bTSH measurement and ultrasound to provide information on function and morphology. Solitary nodules have to be differentiated into "cold" and "hot" by scintigraphy.  For cold nodules, FNA cytology is strongly recommended. Immunogenic hyperthyroidism is proven by positive TRAK measurement. Thyroidal autonomy requires suppressive scintigraphy for morphologic guidance. Special imaging procedures like CT and MRT are reserved for special situations of retrosternal extension.

TI  - Temperature but not season affects the transplantation immunity of anuran amphibians.  
AB  - The effects of ambient temperature (22 degrees C/10 degrees C) and season (summer/winter) on anuran skin allograft and xenograft rejection was tested in frogs (Rana temporaria and R. esculenta) and toads (Bufo bufo, Bombina variegata, and Bombina bombina). Mean graft survival times were significantly prolonged at the low temperature in a species-specific manner, the edible frog (R. esculenta) being the most sensitive and the common toad (Bufo bufo) relatively resistant. Allografts were more temperature-dependent than xenografts; in the latter case, temperature sensitivity was specific to each donor-host combination. Rejection of second-set grafts in R. esculenta was accelerated both in warmth and in cold, but second-set grafts were less temperature-sensitive than sensitizing ones. Both in summer and in winter, R. esculenta rejected allografts promptly at 22 degrees C but slowly at 10 degrees C. In both seasons, Bombina variegata kept at 22 degrees C rejected allografts in a chronic manner. This indicates that amphibian transplantation immunity depends on the donor-host genetic disparity and ambient temperature but is independent of season.

TI  - Post pupariation cold storage of three species of flies: increasing chilling tolerance by acclimation and recurrent recovery periods.  
AB  - Three species of flies were examined for chilling tolerance from the end of the pupariation to the onset of adult eclosion for the purpose of determining applicability for cold storage. For the housefly, Musca domestica (Diptera, Muscidae), survival to eclosion was affected by developmental stage/age, length of storage, and storage temperature. Houseflies that were closest to having experienced pupariation or the onset of eclosion were the least cold tolerant. For flies stored at 7 or 10 degrees C, age groups placed directly into storage at 36-72 and 36-48 h postpupariation, respectively, had significantly higher poststorage eclosion than younger or older age groups. Death was observed after only 2 or 3 days with the chilling intolerant groups while mid-aged groups survived 10-12 days under cold storage conditions. Damage could be reduced by giving the mid-aged groups chilled at 7 or 10 degrees C recurrent 2- or 3-h recovery periods every 4 days at 28 degrees C. Examination of O2 consumption throughout the housefly pupal and pharate adult stages showed that the most chilling tolerant groups also had the lowest metabolic activity. Combining a prestorage 17-h slow cooling acclimation interval with the recurrent recovery periods increased eclosion of adults 20% for the 12- to 24-h group after 21 days storage at 7 degrees C. Two blowfly species, Lucilia cuprina and Lucilia sericata (Diptera, Calliphoridae), survived 10 degrees C storage best when given a weekly 4-h recovery period. Survival at 90 days poststorage was nearly 50% for L. cuprina and 80% for L. sericata. Increasing survival under subambient temperatures for all three species appears to relate to whether there is a stage of development which allows cold-induced lowering of metabolism that results in a dormant status best characterized as hibernal quiescence. This study indicates that periodic warming during cold storage increases survival by allowing a chilling intolerant stage to develop to a more tolerant stage and/or by eliminating accumulated toxic metabolites.

TI  - INP51, a yeast inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase required for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis and whose absence confers a cold-resistant phenotype.  
AB  - Sequence analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX identified a 946 amino acid open reading frame (YIL002C), designated here as INP51, that has carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions similar to mammalian inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and to yeast SAC1. This two-domain primary structure resembles the mammalian 5-phosphatase, synaptojanin. We report that Inp51p is associated with a particulate fraction and that recombinant Inp51p exhibits intrinsic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity. Deletion of INP51 (inp51) results in a "cold-tolerant" phenotype, enabling significantly faster growth at temperatures below 15 degreesC as compared with a parental strain. Complementation analysis of an inp51 mutant strain demonstrates that the cold tolerance is strictly due to loss of 5-phosphatase catalytic activity. Furthermore, deletion of PLC1 in an inp51 mutant does not abrogate cold tolerance, indicating that Plc1p-mediated production of soluble inositol phosphates is not required. Cells lacking INP51 have a 2-4-fold increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate, whereas cells overexpressing Inp51p exhibit a 35% decrease in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We conclude that INP51 function is critical for proper phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis. In addition, we define a novel role for a 5-phosphatase loss of function mutant that improves the growth of cells at colder temperatures without alteration of growth at normal temperatures, which may have useful commercial applications.

TI  - Reduction of cold-induced hypertension by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to angiotensinogen mRNA and AT1-receptor mRNA in brain and blood.  
AB  - Rats exposed chronically to mild cold (5 degrees C/41 degrees F) develop hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. This provides a unique model of hypertension that is environmentally induced. The blood renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to play a role in both initiating and maintaining the high blood pressure (BP) in cold-induced hypertension. The mechanism also appears to involve both the tissue and brain RAS because there is increased mRNA for angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors in brain and peripheral tissues, an increased spontaneous drinking response, and an increased dipsogenic response to acute administration of angiotensin II (Ang II) in cold-treated rats. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN), targeted to the RAS, have been shown to reduce BP in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Therefore, we injected AS-ODN in rats with cold-induced hypertension to test whether antisense inhibition was effective in reducing this nongenetic nonsurgical hypertension. Sprague-Dawley rats were made hypertensive by cold exposure and injected intracerebroventricularly with AS-ODN to AGT mRNA (n=6) or AT1 receptor mRNA (n=6). Systolic BP was recorded by tail cuff 24 hours later for 2 or 7 days, respectively. Systolic BP decreased significantly in response to AGT-AS-ODN (40+/-6 mm Hg, P<0.01) within 1 day after injection and to AT1 receptor-AS-ODN (P<0.05) for 3 days after injection. The maximum decrease was 41+/-10 mm Hg. Systolic BP then gradually increased to the preinjection level. The spontaneous drinking response to cold treatment also decreased significantly (P<0.05) after AGT-AS-ODN or AT1 receptor-AS-ODN intracerebroventricular injection. Intracardiac injection of AT1-AS-ODN (n=6) reduced systolic BP by 36+/-8 mm Hg (P<0.05) and decreased AT1 receptor as measured by autoradiography in aorta, adrenal glands, and kidneys 24 hours after injection. These data show that AS-ODN reduces BP in cold-induced hypertension and that the hypertension involves both peripheral tissues and central RAS in addition to blood-borne RAS mechanisms.

TI  - The cold plate as a test of nociceptive behaviors: description and application to the study of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain models.  
AB  - A cold plate apparatus was designed to test the responses of unrestrained rats to low temperature stimulation of the plantar aspect of the paw. At plate temperatures of 10 degrees C and 5 degrees C, rats with either chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced inflammation of the hindpaw displayed a stereotyped behavior. Brisk lifts of the treated hindpaw were recorded, while no evidence of other nociceptive behaviors could be discerned. The most consistent responses were obtained with a plate temperature of 5 degrees C in three 5-min testing periods, separated by 10-min intervals during which the animals were returned to a normal environment. Concomitantly to cold testing, the rats were evaluated for their response to heat (plantar test) and mechanical (von Frey hairs) stimuli. In both injury models, while responses to heat stimuli had normalized at 60 days post-injury, a clear lateralization of responses to cold was observed throughout the entire study period. Systemic lidocaine, clonidine, and morphine suppressed responses to cold in a dose-related fashion. At doses that did not affect motor or sensory behavior, both lidocaine and its quaternary derivative QX-314 similarly reduced paw lifts, suggesting that cold hyperalgesia is in part due to peripheral altered nociceptive processing. Clonidine was more potent in CCI then in CFA rats in reducing the response to cold. Paradoxically, clonidine increased the withdrawal latencies to heat in the CCI hindpaw at 40 days and thereafter, at a time when both hindpaws had the same withdrawal latencies in control animals. Morphine was also more potent on CCI than CFA cold responses, indicating that, chronically, CFA-induced hyperalgesia might be opiate resistant. Evidence for tonic endogenous inhibition of cold hyperalgesia was obtained for CFA rats, when systemic naltrexone significantly increased the number of paw lifts; this was not found in rats with CCI. At 60 days, neither morphine nor naltrexone affected cold-induced paw lifting in CFA rats, suggesting that the neuronal circuit mediating cold hyperalgesia in these animals had become opiate insensitive. In conclusion, the cold plate was found to be a reliable method for detecting abnormal nociceptive behavior even at long intervals after nerve or inflammatory injuries, when responses to other nociceptive stimuli have returned to near normal. The results of pharmacological studies suggest that cold hyperalgesia is in part a consequence of altered sensory processing in the periphery, and that it can be independently modulated by opiate and adrenergic systems.

TI  - DNA methylation and the promotion of flowering by vernalization.  
AB  - We have tested the hypothesis that the promotion of flowering by prolonged exposure to low temperatures (vernalization) is mediated by DNA demethylation [Burn, J. E., Bagnall, D. J., Metzger, J. M., Dennis, E. S. & Peacock, W. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 287-291]. Arabidopsis plants that have reduced levels of DNA methylation because of the presence of a methyltransferase (METI) antisense gene flowered earlier than untransformed control plants, without the need for a cold treatment. Decreased DNA methylation mutants (ddm1) also flowered earlier than the wild-type progenitor under conditions where they respond to vernalization. We conclude that demethylation of DNA is sufficient to cause early flowering, and we have found that the promotion of flowering is directly proportional to the decrease in methylation in METI antisense lines. The early-flowering phenotype was inherited in sexual progeny, even when the antisense transgene had been lost by segregation. Methyltransferase antisense plants with low DNA methylation levels responded to a low-temperature treatment by flowering even earlier than their untreated siblings indicating that the promotion of flowering by cold and by demethylation was additive when neither treatment saturated the early-flowering response. As in untransformed control plants, the cold-induced early-flowering signal was reset in progeny of METI antisense plants. These observations suggest that the demethylation brought about by a METI antisense can account for some properties of vernalization, but not for the need for revernalization in each generation.

TI  - Simultaneous involvement of thyroid by Riedel's [correction of Reidel's] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a case report [published erratum appears in Thyroid 1998 Aug;8(8):736]  
AB  - We report an unusual thyroid lesion showing histologic features of both Riedel's [corrected] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a 57-year-old white female. The clinical presentation was hypothyroidism associated with a solitary firm to hard cold nodule replacing the entire right lobe of thyroid gland. Pathological examination demonstrated extensive replacement of the thyroid parenchyma with dense keloidal fibrosis, intermixed well-developed lymphoid follicles, scattered lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The fibrotic process extended into the perithyroidal soft tissues and skeletal muscle with complete obliteration of the thyroid capsule. These findings were consistent with Riedel's [corrected] disease. However, the immunohistochemical stains for B and T markers and immunoglobulin light chains showed an immunoprofile consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This combination of Riedel's [corrected] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis is rare and coincidental, as both represent two distinct clinicopathological entities.

TI  - Comparative phylogeography and postglacial colonization routes in Europe.  
AB  - The Quaternary cold periods in Europe are thought to have heavily influenced the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation in both animals and plants. The phylogeographies of 10 taxa, including mammals (Ursus arctos, Sorex spp., Crocidura suaveolens, Arvicola spp.), amphibians (Triturus spp.), arthropods (Chorthippus parallelus), and plants (Abies alba, Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp.), were analysed to elucidate general trends across Europe. Only a small degree of congruence was found amongst the phylogeographies of the 10 taxa, but the likely postglacial colonization routes exhibit some similarities. A Brooks parsimony analysis produced an unrooted area phylogram, showing that: (i) the northern regions were colonized generally from the Iberic and Balkanic refugia; and (ii) the Italian lineages were often isolated due to the presence of the Alpine barrier. The comparison of colonization routes highlighted four main suture-zones where lineages from the different refugia meet. Some of the intraspecific genetic distances among lineages indicated a prequaternary divergence that cannot be connected to any particular cold period, but are probably related mainly to the date of arrival of each taxon in the European continent. As a consequence, molecular genetics so far appears to be of limited use in dating Quaternary events.

TI  - [Neurologist, otolaryngologist...? Which specialist should treat facial pain?]  
AB  - Pain is a major public health problem. The management of orofacial pain may be a difficult challenge to the medical and dental professions. Ideally, severe cases of this type of pain should be treated by a team drawn from several disciplines such as neurology, otolaryngology, dentistry and psychiatry. Trigeminal neuralgia patients develop brief, very severe unilateral pain, usually radiating from the upper or lower jaw toward the ear, and confined to the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The pain may be triggered by chewing, shaving or exposure to cold wind. Most patients respond to carbamazepine, with phenytoin or baclofen as an alternative. Intractable pain may require surgical treatment. Horton's syndrome (cluster headache) is always unilateral and is often associated with unilateral lacrimation and rhinorrhoea. The pain is extreme, and its typical localisation the eye, forehead, temple, jaws, or teeth. Treatment with ergotamine and sumatriptan has been used with some success, calcium blockers (e.g., verapamil) being used as prophylaxis. Atypical facial pain is a continuous ache with intermittent episodes, localised to non-muscular, non-joint facial areas. The pain may be unilateral or bilateral, and may persist for many years. Typically, these patients consult a variety of specialists, such as dentists and otolaryngologists. Surgical procedures such as tooth extraction or sinus surgery, even if skillfully executed, exacerbate the condition, are are thus contraindicated. If the patient does not respond to reassurance, antidepressants may be tried. In sinusitis, the pain location is dependent upon which paranasal sinus is affected. Routine diagnostic nasal endoscopy and coronal plane computed tomography enable subtle pathological changes that are related to chronic pain to be identified. If medical treatment fails to afford relief, surgery should be considered. Pain, limited range of jaw motion, and joint noises are the common characteristics of temporomandibular disorders. Treatment usually consists of non-surgical means such as splints, occlusal equilibration, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgical treatment is indicated in a few carefully selected cases. Most dental pain is attributable to caries or periodontal disease. When pus is present, drainage affords excellent pain relief. Acute pericoronitis involving mandibular third molars responds to irrigation, removal of maxillary third molar trauma, and--in cases of serious infection--antimicrobial therapy. Early recognition of a case of chronic pain improves the chances of successful management, and avoids frustration and disillusion both to patient and doctor.

TI  - Neurotropin induces antinociceptive effect by enhancing descending pain inhibitory systems involving 5-HT3 and noradrenergic alpha2 receptors in spinal dorsal horn.  
AB  - Neurotropin, a non-protein extract from the inflamed skin of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus, has been clinically used as an analgesic drug in Japan. Its analgesic effect has been demonstrated by reduced mechano-nociception in hyperalgesic rats exposed to SART-stress (a repeated cold stress) for 5 days. In order to clarify the mechanism of the analgesic effect of neurotropin at the spinal cord level, we examined the effects of several neurotransmitter receptor antagonists given by intrathecal (i.t.) injection on the antinociceptive effect of intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected neurotropin [100 and 200 Neurotropin Unit (NU)/kg]. The analgesic effect of neurotropin was significantly inhibited not only by methysergide (100 nmol/rat, i.t.), a non-selective antagonist against serotonin (5-HT), but also MDL 72222 (30 nmol/rat, i.t.), a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, but not influenced by ketanserin (100 nmol/rat, i.t.), a 5-HT2A antagonist. The antinociceptive effect of neurotropin (200 NU/kg, i. p.) was significantly inhibited also by yohimbine (30 nmol/rat, i.t.), a noradrenergic alpha2 antagonist. However, the analgesic effect of neurotropin (100 and 200 NU/kg, i.p.) was not influenced by naloxone (30 nmol/rat, i.t.), an opioid antagonist. These results suggest that the mechanism of the antinociceptive effect of neurotropin is via enhancement of endogenous descending pain inhibitory pathways of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, especially involving 5-HT3 and noradrenergic alpha2 receptors in spinal dorsal horn in which these neurons terminate. No influence of opioid receptors at the spinal cord level is indicated.

TI  - [Urticaria caused by cold. 104 cases]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Superficial and deep cold urticaria is a heterogeneous group of manifestations induced by exposure to cold (0 to 4 degrees C). Frequency is generally estimated at 2 to 3 p. 100. We studied retrospectively 104 patients meeting clinical, biological and therapeutic criteria of cold urticaria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1981 to 1995, 1802 patients with urticaria were included in a standardized allergy survey. Among these patients, 104 met the criteria for the diagnosis of cold urticaria: positive test with 3 ice cubes placed on the skin for 5, 10 and 15 minutes or positive immersion test (immersion in 4 degrees C water for 15 minutes). Two groups of patients were excluded, those with systemic cold urticaria and those with minimal thermo-differential urticaria. RESULTS: Cold urticaria was found in 5.7 p. 100 of our urticaria patients, predominantly in young women. The triggering effect of cold was found at history taking in 71 p. 100 of the cases. The urticaria was usually superficial, more rarely associated with deep and/or mucosal urticaria. General signs were uncommon. The three ice cube test demonstrated significative biological and immunological abnormalities. In 5 cases, discrete cryoprecipitate was found (4 cryoglobulins, 1 cryofibrinogen). Although the search for an infectious agent was not conducted in absolutely all cases, there was no apparently remarkable association with infection the exception of VIH infection. Anti-H1 agents were given in 88.3 p. 100 of the cases leading to short-term improvement. Follow-up is insufficient to evaluate long-term outcome. DISCUSSION: This retrospective survey of 104 cases of cold urticaria was compared with data in the literature, particularly with the small number of studies including a large number of patients. We conclude that the diagnosis of cold urticaria can be based on history taking alone and the three ice cube tests (prognosis value, indication of reaction threshold). An exhaustive search for the cause is not indicated. A search for cryopathy should however always be done and followed by a complete work-up in case of positivity. Clinical signs other than cold urticaria suggesting a pathological response to cold require complete investigations.

TI  - Combined intranasal ipratropium bromide and oxymetazoline in experimental rhinovirus infection.  
AB  - The topical anticholinergic ipratropium bromide and topical decongestant oxymetazoline were tested to determine whether oxymetazoline alone and the combination were well tolerated and reduced rhinorrhea and middle ear pressure abnormalities during experimental rhinovirus infection. The study was double-bind, placebo-controlled, and double dummy in design. Healthy volunteers (n = 109) with low serum neutralizing antibody titer (< or = 1:2) were. Treatments inoculated with rhinovirus (type 39 or Hank's strain) and randomized to treatment with ipra-tropium bromide 0.06% two sprays per nostril (84 micrograms per treatment) and oxymetazoline 0.05% two sprays per nostril, oxymetazoline alone, or placebo. Treatments were self administered twice daily for 5 days beginning 1 day after rhinovirus inoculation. The overall infection rate was 83% and of those infected, 88% felt that they had a cold. During the 3-hour period after dosing, the increase in nasal discharge was significantly lower in the combined ipratropium and oxymetazoline (0.13 +/- 0.17 gm/3 hr, mean +/- SE) than after oxymetazoline alone (0.60 +/- 0.18 gm/3 hr) or vehicle (0.73 +/- 0.18 gm/3 hr). Over the 5-day observation period, total daily nasal discharge also tended to be lower in the ipratropium plus oxymetazoline group (3.67 +/- 0.70 gm/24 hr, mean +/- SE) compared to oxymetazoline (5.61 +/- 0.73: 35% reduction) or the vehicle (5.04 +/- 0.73; 27% reduction) recipients, but the differences were not statistically significant. Subjective assessments of rhinorrhea indicated that the severity of rhinorrhea was significantly better among patients receiving oxymetazoline alone or with ipratropium compared to the vehicle. No significant difference in the cumulative frequencies of middle ear pressure abnormalities (27-31%) were found among the treatment groups. Oxymetazoline does not consistently stimulate or decrease nasal mucus production, and ipratropium added to oxymetazoline is well tolerated and reduces rhinorrhea during experimental rhinovirus infection.

TI  - Effect of cold air on exercise capacity in COPD: increase or decrease?  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effect of cold air on exercise capacity in COPD. DESIGN: Cycle ergometer tests under different environmental conditions. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory and an environmental chamber at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with stable COPD; 14 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: A preliminary cycle ergometer test followed by two incremental, symptom-limited cycle ergometer tests, one at 24 degrees C and the other at -20 degrees C. MEASUREMENTS: On the first study day: arterial blood gas analysis, 12 to 15 s maximal voluntary ventilation, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves before and 1 h after inhalation of 80 microg of ipratropium bromide, and diffusion capacity of the lung. During the exercise challenges: spirometric indices, minute ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), facial skin temperature, and heart rate. The feeling of dyspnea was assessed with a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The maximal work load was 87.5+/-7.3 W at -20 degrees C compared with 96.4+/-6.9 W at 24 degrees C (p<0.05). Accordingly, the exercise duration was shorter in the cold. Exercise dyspnea was more severe in the cold at equal work loads. The shortening of exercise duration induced by cold air correlated with the enhancement of exercise dyspnea. Furthermore, cold air cooled the facial skin and induced immediate bronchoconstriction. VE, VO2, VCO2, and heart rate did not differ between the warm and cold challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Cold air decreases exercise capacity in COPD, probably by increasing exercise dyspnea.

TI  - Zinc gluconate lozenges for treating the common cold in children: a randomized controlled trial [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: The common cold is one of the most frequently occurring illnesses and is responsible for substantial morbidity and economic loss. Biochemical evidence suggests that zinc may be an effective treatment, and zinc gluconate glycine (ZGG) lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms in adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ZGG treatment of colds in children and adolescents. DESIGN: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Two suburban school districts in Cleveland, Ohio. PATIENTS: A total of 249 students in grades 1 through 12 were enrolled within the first 24 hours of experiencing at least 2 of 9 symptoms of the common cold. INTERVENTION: Zinc lozenges, 10 mg, orally dissolved, 5 times a day (in grades 1-6) or 6 times a day (in grades 7-12). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to resolution of cold symptoms based on subjective daily symptom scores for cough, headache, hoarseness, muscle ache, nasal congestion, nasal drainage, scratchy throat, sore throat, and sneezing. RESULTS: Time to resolution of all cold symptoms did not differ significantly between students receiving zinc (n = 124) and those receiving placebo (n = 125) (median, 9 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8-9 days; median, 9 days, 95% CI, 7-10 days, respectively; P=.71). There were no significant differences in the time to resolution of any of the 9 symptoms studied. Compared with controls, more students in the zinc group reported adverse effects (88.6% vs 79.8%; P=.06); bad taste (60.2% vs 37.9%; P=.001); nausea (29.3% vs 16.1%; P=.01); mouth, tongue, or throat discomfort (36.6% vs 24.2%; P=.03); and diarrhea (10.6% vs 4.0%; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based, randomized controlled trial, ZGG lozenges were not effective in treating cold symptoms in children and adolescents. Further studies with virologic testing are needed to clarify what role, if any, zinc may play in treating cold symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine in a pilot study the feasibility of noninvasive techniques of (a) measurement of rewarming response after a standard cold challenge test (using thermographic imaging) and (b) measurement of nailfold capillary dimensions using video capillaroscopy, in the assessment of children presenting with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). METHODS: Ten children with RP and 10 age matched healthy controls were studied. No child had definite evidence of underlying connective tissue disease. RESULTS: Children with RP had abnormal rewarming curves. The gradient of the rewarming curve was significantly lower in children with RP (median 1.5 vs 5.0 degrees C/min in controls; p = 0.015), and there was a trend for the lag time (the interval between the end of the cold challenge and the onset of rewarming) to be increased in children with RP (median 4.7 vs 0.5 min in controls; p = 0.08). Capillary dimensions were measured in 7 of the children with RP, and were similar to those of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Thermography and nailfold capillaroscopy are feasible in children and should be further evaluated.

TI  - Role of glutathione in hepatic bile formation during reperfusion after cold ischemia of the rat liver.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Liver reperfusion following cold ischemia is frequently associated with diminished bile flow in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Glutathione is a major determinant of bile-acid independent bile flow, and the effects of cold ischemia on biliary glutathione excretion are unknown. METHODS: We examined the effects of cold ischemia (University of Wisconsin solution (4 degrees C), 24 h) with subsequent reperfusion (100 min) on biliary glutathione excretion in a recirculating system. Since glutathione might represent an important antioxidant within the biliary tract and oxidative stress in the biliary tract during reperfusion could contribute to the pathogenesis of bile duct injury after liver transplantation, we also assessed bile duct morphology in reperfused livers of mutant TR- -rats, in whom biliary excretion of glutathione is already impaired. RESULTS: Hepatic bile formation was diminished in reperfused Wistar rat livers after cold ischemia. Biliary glutathione concentrations and output were significantly decreased and correlated with postischemic changes in bile secretion. An increased biliary oxidized glutathione/glutathione ratio, indicating oxidative stress, was detected only immediately after the onset of reperfusion. Basal bile flow rates in TR- -rat livers which were already markedly reduced in control-perfused livers, decreased further during the early but not the later reperfusion period. Reperfusion of both Wistar and TR- -rat livers was not associated with electron microscopic evidence of bile duct damage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that impaired biliary excretion of glutathione contributes to decreased bile flow after cold ischemia. The absence of biliary glutathione does not appear to promote ultrastructural evidence of bile duct injury during reperfusion in the isolated perfused rat liver.

TI  - A comparison of the University of Wisconsin solution and the modified Kawakami solution for initial flush and coronary perfusion in long-term canine heart preservation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared two different solutions, the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution (intracellular-like) and the modified Kawakami (mK) solution (extracellular-like), for initial flush of coronary vascular beds before simple storage and following coronary perfusion. METHODS: After a right thoracotomy in the 4th intercostal space, the donor heart was isolated by ligating the azygos vein and venae cavae, and cross-clamping the aorta. Cardiac arrest was then obtained with a cold GIK solution. Following initial flush of coronary vascular beds, the donor heart was resected, stored utilizing a combination of simple immersion and coronary perfusion, and then transplanted. A total of 48 mongrel dogs was divided into three groups each using different solutions for the initial flush of coronary vascular beds and for coronary perfusion. In group I (n=10) the UW solution was used for both initial flush and coronary perfusion. In group II (n=7) the mK solution was used for both initial flush and coronary perfusion, and in group III (n=7) the UW solution was used for initial flush and the mK solution for coronary perfusion. Intracellular high-energy phosphate was surveyed by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: After 12-hour simple immersion and 1-hour coronary perfusion, phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate were significantly (p<0.05) higher in group III than in groups I and II. The high-energy phosphate levels of the graft tissue were better in groups I and III than in group II. Orthotopic transplantation was then performed using 10 preserved grafts in group I and seven preserved grafts of group III. After transplantation, left ventricular (LV) pressure of group I animals recovered to 82.3% and group III recovered to 95.8% of the control values. LV dp/dt of group I and III animals recovered to 76.5% and 96.7% of the control values, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The UW solution, which is acceptable for both initial flush and simple storage, is not suitable for continuous coronary perfusion even for a short period due to its high viscosity. A combination of the UW solution both for initial flush and the following cold simple immersion and the mK solution for continuous coronary perfusion is appropriate for long-term preservation of the canine heart.

TI  - Assessment of cutaneous blood flow by using topographical perfusion mapping techniques.  
AB  - The ability of laser Doppler scanning to reproduce the spatial pattern of cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) in a 6.25-cm2 area of skin was evaluated at supine rest (28 degrees C), during thermal stress (cold and heat), and during baroreceptor unloading with -40-mmHg lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The spatial pattern of resting CVC was similar on 3 different days, varying by 6 +/- 3%.  During cold stress, 89 +/- 2% of the skin area showed a decrease in skin blood flow (37 +/- 2%), whereas heat stress increased CVC in 94 +/- 5% of the skin area. During LBNP, the pattern of CVC response was not uniform, and frequency analysis indicated that 47 +/- 5% of the pixels showed a reduction in CVC (>1 SE), 28 +/- 2% of the skin area were unaffected, and the remaining 26 +/- 5% of the pixels showed some increase in CVC. These data indicate the ability of topographical perfusion mapping to provide quantitative and reproducible information about the spatial distribution of CVC. In addition, the site-to-site variability in reflex control of skin blood flow during LBNP is intriguing and requires more rigorous evaluation.

TI  - HOS1, a genetic locus involved in cold-responsive gene expression in arabidopsis.  
AB  - Low-temperature stress induces the expression of a variety of genes in plants. However, the signal transduction pathway(s) that activates gene expression under cold stress is poorly understood. Mutants defective in cold signaling should facilitate molecular analysis of plant responses to low temperature and eventually lead to the identification and cloning of a cold stress receptor(s) and intracellular signaling components. In this study, we characterize a plant mutant affected in its response to low temperatures. The Arabidopsis hos1-1 mutation identified by luciferase imaging causes superinduction of cold-responsive genes, such as RD29A, COR47, COR15A, KIN1, and ADH. Although these genes are also induced by abscisic acid, high salt, or polyethylene glycol in addition to cold, the hos1-1 mutation only enhances their expression under cold stress. Genetic analysis revealed that hos1-1 is a single recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. Our studies using the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the cold-responsive RD29A promoter have indicated that cold-responsive genes can be induced by temperatures as high as 19 degrees C in hos1-1 plants. In contrast, wild-type plants do not express the luciferase reporter at 10 degrees C or higher. Compared with the wild type, hos1-1 plants are l ess cold hardy. Nonetheless, after 2 days of cold acclimation, hos1-1 plants acquired the same degree of freezing tolerance as did the wild type. The hos1-1 plants flowered earlier than did the wild-type plants and appeared constitutively vernalized. Taken together, our findings show that the HOS1 locus is an important negative regulator of cold signal transduction in plant cells and that it plays critical roles in controlling gene expression under cold stress, freezing tolerance, and flowering time.

TI  - Optimal pH for simple cold storage or machine perfusion of dog kidneys with UW solution.  
AB  - Metabolic suppression by temperature is a key to successful organ preservation. Additional methods for inducing metabolic suppression may further improve organ preservation. Extracellular acidosis has been shown to suppress warm anoxic injury to various isolated cells. Acidosis may suppress enzymes with a pH optimum at the pH of the cytosol (pH 7.3). In this study, the combination of hypothermia and acidosis was used to determine if it would improve renal preservation. Dog kidneys were cold-stored (CS) for 48 h in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with the pH adjusted to 6.4, 6.8, 7.4, or 7.8. Kidneys were also machine-perfused (MP) for 3 days with the gluconate perfusion solution (Belzer's machine perfusion solution, MPS) at pHs similar to those tested for CS. Renal function (serum creatinine, SCr) and survival were recorded in immediate contralateral nephrectomized recipients. On the basis of maximum SCr values, kidneys preserved by CS or MP were best preserved at pHs of 7.4 or 7.8. At a pH of 6.8, SCr values were elevated and returned to normal at a slower rate than in those preserved at higher pHs. This study shows that acidosis is not cytoprotective to cold-stored dog kidneys and causes preservation/reperfusion injury.

TI  - Warm blood hyperkalaemic reperfusion ('hot shot') prevents myocardial substrate derangement in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A significant metabolic derangement occurs in the ischaemic-reperfused heart of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery using cold blood cardioplegia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this effect could be reversed by complementing cold blood cardioplegia with a short terminal exposure of warm blood hyperkalaemic cardioplegia ('hot shot'). METHODS: Thirty-five patients undergoing primary elective coronary revascularisation were randomized to one of two different techniques of myocardial protection. In the cold blood group (n = 17) myocardial protection was induced using antegrade hyperkalaemic cold blood cardioplegic solution. In the hot shot group (n = 18) this was supplemented with a short exposure to hyperkalaemic warm blood cardioplegia prior to removal of the cross clamp. Intracellular substrates (ATP and amino acids) were measured in left ventricular biopsies collected 5 min after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, after 30 min of ischaemic arrest and 20 min after reperfusion. RESULTS: Biopsies taken at the end of the period of myocardial ischaemia, when compared to control, did not show any significant change in the intracellular concentration of ATP (from 2.71 +/- 0.32 to 2.43 +/- 0.37 micromol g wet for cold blood group and from 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.5 +/- 0.34 micromol/g wet weight for hot shot group) or total free intracellular amino acids pool (from 33.0 +/- 1.4 to 30.0 +/- 1.4 micromol/g wet weight for cold blood group and from 34.0 +/- 1.4 to 34.5 +/- 2.3 micromol/g wet weight for hot shot group). Upon reperfusion, however, there was a significant fall in ATP (23.7 +/- 1.6 micromol/g wet weight amino acids, P < 0.05) and in amino acids (1.53 +/- 0.24 micromol/g wet weight, P < 0.05) in the group receiving only cold blood cardioplegia but not in the hot shot group (2.27 +/- 0.27 micromol/g wet weight ATP and 30.5 +/- 1.6 micromol/g wet weight amino acids). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that warm blood hyperkalaemic reperfusion hot shot prevents myocardial metabolic derangement seen during coronary artery surgery.

TI  - Successful gene transfer to the porcine liver in vivo with an adenoviral vector.  
AB  - In vivo gene transfer to the porcine liver was tested with adenoviral vector to achieve molecular biological graft modulation. In adult female pigs immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and prednisolone, the liver was surgically isolated and flushed out with cold lactate Ringer solution (4 degrees C), by means of a pump-controlled bypass of the portal vein and the inferior vena cava in Groups A and D. In Group A (n = 4), 2 x 1011 pfu of the adenoviral vectors (pAdexCALacZ) were injected through the left hepatic artery during cold ischemia. In Group (n = 4), 2 x 1011 pfu of adenovirus vectors were injected through the auricular vein in a one-shot manner without a laparotomy. In Group C (n = 4), 2 x 1011 pfu/ml of adenoviral vectors were injected through the hepatic artery in a one-shot manner, without a surgical isolation of the liver. Group D (n = 4) animals received the same protocol as Group A except for the fact that they did not receive the immunosuppressive regimen. In a polymerase chain reaction, a transfected LacZ sequence was detected until POD 28 in Group A, but not in the other groups. In 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining, only the Group A animals revealed apparent staining predominantly in the portal area at POD 2, which then continued to be recognized until POD 28. The in situ perfusion of the liver combined with immunosuppression is thought to provide an ideal environment for the liver-directed adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the porcine liver, by enabling a long contact with a high titer of the adenoviral vector.

However, any of the triad may be absent, which often leads to confusion in diagnosing the condition. Although the cause is unknown, Henoch-Schonlein purpura is often associated with infectious agents such as group A streptococci and Mycoplasma. It has also been associated with food reactions, exposure to cold, insect bites and drug allergies. Treatment is supportive, and children affected by this disorder need close follow-up of renal status.

TI  - Rapid brain cooling in diving ducks.  
AB  - Hypothermia may limit asphyxic damages to the brain, and many small homeotherms have been shown to use anapyrexic strategies when exposed to asphyxic conditions. Larger homeotherms do not seem to use the same strategy, but could save oxygen and prevent hypoxic brain damage by employing selective brain cooling (SBC) in connection with asphyxia. To test the hypothesis that selective brain cooling may take place in connection with asphyxia, we have recorded brain [hypothalamic (THyp)] and body [colonic (TC)] temperatures and heart rates in four Pekin ducks during 5-min simulated (head submersion) diving in cold water (10 degrees C). Diving resulted in a drop in THyp (3.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C) that continued into the recovery period (P < 0.001). Restricting heat loss from the buccal cavity and eyes during diving compromised brain cooling in an additive manner. TC was not influenced by diving. Control cooling of the head with crushed ice during a 5-min period of undisturbed breathing had no effect on THyp. Warm water (35 degrees C) markedly reduced brain cooling, and dive capacity was reduced by approximately 14% (P < 0.05) compared with diving in water at 10 degrees C. The data suggest that SBC is used in ducks during diving, and we propose that this mechanism may enable the bird to save oxygen for prolonged aerobic submergence and to protect the brain from asphyxic damages.

TI  - Intracisternal antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor blocked vagal-dependent stimulation of gastric emptying induced by acute cold in rats.  
AB  - Cold exposure increases TRH gene expression in hypothalamic and raphe nuclei and results in a vagal activation of gastric function. We investigated the role of medullary TRH receptors in cold (4-6 C, 90 min)-induced stimulation of gastric motor function in fasted conscious rats using intracisternal injections of TRH receptor (TRHr) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (100 microg twice, -48 and -24 h). The gastric emptying of a methyl-cellulose solution was assessed by the phenol red method. TRH (0.1 microg) or the somatostatin subtype 5-preferring analog, BIM-23052 (1 microg), injected intracisternally increased basal gastric emptying by 34% and 47%, respectively. TRHr antisense, which had no effect on basal emptying, blocked TRH action but did not influence that of BIM-23052. Cold exposure increased gastric emptying by 64%, and the response was inhibited by vagotomy, atropine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), and TRHr antisense (intracisternally). Saline or mismatched oligodeoxynucleotides, injected intracisternally under similar conditions, did not alter the enhanced gastric emptying induced by cold or intracisternal injection of TRH or BIM-23052. These results indicate that TRH receptor activation in the brain stem mediates acute cold-induced vagal cholinergic stimulation of gastric transit, and that medullary TRH may play a role in the autonomic visceral responses to acute cold.

TI  - Sympathetic activity in brown adipose tissue from rats adapted to a high protein, carbohydrate-free diet.  
AB  - Previous studies have shown that adaptation of rats to a high protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet results in a marked reduction in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity. The present experiments were carried out to assess BAT sympathetic activity in HP diet-adapted rats. It was found that interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) norepinephrine (NE) content, fractional turnover rate and calculated rate of turnover were markedly reduced in HP-fed rats. Replacement of the HP diet by a control, balanced diet for 24 h did not affect BAT NE content significantly, but restored fractional turnover rate and turnover rate values to those of control animals. Exposure to cold (4 degrees) for a short period (8 h) induced a marked increase in IBAT NE fractional turnover rate and calculated turnover rate in both HP and control rats.  The cold-induced rise of turnover rate over values at ambient temperature (25 degrees C) was higher in HP rats than in controls. Rectal temperature after 8 h of cold exposure did not differ in HP and control rats. The data suggest that the decreased thermogenic capacity of rats adapted to a high protein, carbohydrate-free diet is due to a reduced sympathetic outflow to BAT, which can be rapidly reactivated by cold stimulation.

AB  - Aspects of the cold-shock response in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL41-1 were investigated. First, it was determined whether new proteins were synthesized in response to cold shock. Cell-free extracts were prepared from a cold-shocked (exposed to 10 degreesC for 5 h) culture (cfe-cs) and from a non-cold-shocked (held at 30 degreesC continuously) culture (cfe-non), and were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein of approximately 6.3 kDa was present in the cfe-cs and appeared not to be present in the cfe-non. No other changes were evident. Second, the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance of cells that have been frozen at -20 degreesC for up to 1 year was examined. Without the cold-shock treatment prior to freezing the cell viability following freezing for 1 day was 34%, 14 days 32%, 182 days 7%, and 364 days 0.2%. However, with the cold shock treatment it was 83%, 82%, 12%, and 0.8%, respectively. It appears that cold shock significantly improves cryotolerance of the cells for short periods of freezing, but the protective effect was less marked following longer storage periods.

TI  - [Intrahepatic glutathione and oxidative stress in liver transplantation in the pig]  
AB  - OBJECT: To determine the loss of endogenous GSH from livers cold-stored and reperfused, using a model of liver transplantation in the pig. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four female Yorkshire pigs weighing 19 to 40 kg received a liver allograft. Donor livers were cold-stored in the UW solution. Mean cold ischemic time was 6.5 hours. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were used as an index of oxidative stress. MDA plasma levels were measured following recipient laparotomy (H0), immediately (H1), and 90 minutes after liver reperfusion (H2). MDA and GSH levels in liver were measured following donor laparotomy (T0), at the end of cold ischemic period (T1), and at 90 minutes following liver reperfusion (T2). RESULTS: Three animals survived. MDA liver levels decreased of 44% between T0 and T1, then increased to 92% at T2. In contrast, in plasma, graft reperfusion was associated with an increase of MDA to 140% of the baseline values which reached 188% at H2. Intrahepatic GSH levels decreased of 49% at T1, then to 72% at T2. CONCLUSION: our study suggests that in liver transplantation: (1) Hepatic GSH is depleted to 49% during cold-storage, and an additional 23% is lost after reperfusion; (2) GSH contained in the UW solution does not prevent the loss of hepatocellular glutathione during preservation and reperfusion; (3) after short periods of cold ichemia, endogenous hepatic GSH may protect against oxydative stress in the transplanted liver.

TI  - [The reaction of the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis to cold saline stimulus]  
AB  - To clarify the nature of the reaction pattern of the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis, nasal lavage using a cold saline solution of 4 degrees C and a warm saline solution was attempted in 8 patients with nasal allergy to the pollen of the Japanese cedar and cypress in a non-scatter season, and the concentration of protein contents in the nasal washings was determined. The concentrations of total protein, albumin and 26 kD protein were higher in cold saline than in the warm saline lavage. In particular, the concentration of 26 kD protein was 5.3 times higher. However, the concentration was not very high compared with the value obtained by warm saline lavage in the scatter season. These findings indicate that the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis is reactive to cold saline stimuli even in the non-scatter season.

TI  - [The diagnosis of "smoker's lung" encourages smoking cessation]  
AB  - In a controlled randomised trial we analysed whether the use of the term "smoker's lung" (Danish: "rygerlunger") instead of chronic bronchitis when talking to patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) changed their smoking habits. Fifty-six smoking patients with COLD were allocated to either intervention (n = 25) or control groups (n = 31). In the intervention group the lung disease was designated smoker's lung in all communication with patients about their illness and in the control group traditional terminology was used. All patients were given the same medical treatment and the same encouragement to stop smoking. One week after discharge 57% had stopped smoking in the smoker's lung group vs 26% in the control group (p = 0.028), at three months 50% vs 19% (p = 0.027) and at one year 40% vs 20% (p = 0.148). Referring directly to the cause of a self-inflicted illness may be an effective way of discouraging risk behaviour, at negligible cost.
