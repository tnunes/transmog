TI  - Catecholaminergic regulation of proliferation and survival in rat forebrain paraventricular germinal cells.  
AB  - We have investigated the possible role of alpha1-adrenoreceptors in regulating the germination of progenitor cells cultured from embryonic rat neocortex. High binding levels of the alpha1-selective radioligand 3[H]prazosin were detected in the forebrain of the rat embryo at E13, and the greatest density of binding sites was localized to the ventricular and subventricular zones. Catecholamine-containing axon terminals were present in these zones in the same period. Germinal neuroepithelial cells retained specific 3[H]prazosin binding in culture. Approximately 25% of cells in culture displayed complex intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to phenylephrine, many of which were abolished with the alpha1B antagonist, chloroethylclonidine. Cultures exhibited concentration-dependent catecholamine stimulation of DNA synthesis mediated by alpha1 receptors in serum-limited conditions. Neuroepithelial cells were labelled via their ventricular processes by intraventricular injection of Fast blue in E13 embryos prior to transfer of the neocortex to dissociated cell culture. Many of labelled cells were present in culture in germinal foci. Some cells which migrated from these foci underwent apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL in situ hybridization. During a transitory period of up to 48 h in culture, alpha1-adrenoreceptor activation by phenylephrine or noradrenaline increased the number of surviving cells. Apoptosis was observed in vivo in both ventricular and subventricular zones of the neocortex from E13 to E15 in increasing numbers. We propose that both the supply of noradrenaline to forebrain germinal cells, and the expression of alpha1-adrenoreceptors on their surface could act to determine whether they die or continue to proliferate.

TI  - Modifications of circadian and circannual rhythms with aging.  
AB  - Whereas biological rhythms are now fairly well documented in young healthy adults, reports in elderly are relatively few for obvious reasons, including the difficulty of setting groups matched in age, sociological and professional background, medical history, and not in need of specific medication. Aging may modify one or several parameters characterizing biological rhythms. The modifications are different from one function to the next, and great care should be given not to mistake changes attributable to the aging process with those resulting from physical and physiological impairment caused by passed environmental aggressions and diseases. Nevertheless, the increasing number of subjects reaching the age of 65 or older, thanks to medical progress, makes necessary establishing time-qualified references values in the aged, as this kind of investigation should lead to an improvement of the conditions and quality of life of elderly subjects.

TI  - The cellular basis of tumor progression.  
AB  - Variability in disease presentation and course is a hallmark of cancer. Variability is seen among similarly diagnosed cancers in different patients or animal hosts and in the same cancer at different periods of time. This latter type of variability, termed "tumor progression," was defined by Foulds in a series of six rules that describe the independent behavior of individual cancers and the independent evolution of different cancer characteristics. Tumor progression is believed to result from variability among subpopulations of tumor cells within individual cancers and from selection of these subpopulations by conditions within the cancer environment, such that different subpopulations come to prominence over the course of cancer development and growth. Interactions among subpopulations, however, modulate tumor behavior as well as tumor evolution. The leading hypothesis for the origin of tumor subpopulations is the genetic instability of cancer cells. There are a number of possible mechanisms of genetic instability, some internal to cancer cells (mutation, amplification, mutator phenotypes, DNA repair deficiencies) and some present in the tumor microenvironment (endogenous mutagens). There are also potential epigenetic mechanisms of variability, including alterations in gene regulation, differentiation, adaptation, and cell fusion. Regardless of mechanism, the heterogeneity of tumor subpopulations poses a number of challenges to the practice of cancer research, including the design of reproducible and meaningful experiments. Tumor heterogeneity also has significant consequences for the clinical assessment of tumor prognosis and the development of effective treatment regimens.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of gamma frequency oscillations tetanically induced in the rat hippocampal slice.  
AB  - 1. We used transverse and longitudinal rat hippocampal slices to study the synchronization of gamma frequency (> 20 Hz) oscillations, across distances of up to 4.5 mm. gamma oscillations were evoked in the CA1 region by tetanic stimulation at one or two sites simultaneously, and were associated with population spikes. Tetanic stimuli that were strong enough to induce oscillations were associated with depolarization of both pyramidal cells and interneurones, largely produced by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. 2. Computer simulations of gamma oscillations were also performed in a model with pyramidal cells and interneurones, arranged in a chain of five cell groups. This model had suggested previously that interneurone networks alone could generate synchronous gamma oscillations locally, but that pyramidal cell firing, by inducing spike doublets in interneurones, was necessary for the occurrence of highly correlated oscillations with small phase lag (< 2.5 ms), in a distributed network possessing long axon conduction delays. 3. In both experiment and model, pyramidal cell spikes occurred in phase with local population spikes, as did the first spike of the interneurone doublet. 4. The conductance of the interneurone alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated conductance was manipulated in the model, while the relation between oscillations at opposite ends of the chain was examined. When the conductance was large enough for doublet firing to be synaptically induced in interneurones, oscillation phase lags were < 2.25 ms across the chain. As predicted, experimental blockade of AMPA receptors resulted in increased phase lags between two sites oscillating simultaneously, compared with control conditions. 5. Both in model and in experiment, when stimuli to the two ends of the network were slightly different, cross-network synchronization occurred with a shorter phase lag at high frequencies than at lower frequencies. 6. These data suggest that, while interneurone networks alone can generate locally synchronized gamma oscillations, firing of pyramidal cells, and the synaptically induced doublet firing in interneurones, contribute to the stability and tight synchrony of the oscillations in distributed networks.

TI  - Control of repetitive lip and finger movements in Parkinson's disease: influence of external timing signals and simultaneous execution on motor performance.  
AB  - This study addresses the question of whether external timing signals and/or simultaneous rhythmic movements of other limbs can alleviate sequencing motor deficits associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Subjects performed rhythmic lip and finger movements simultaneously or in isolation. In addition, they had to self-pace their movements or match them to an external signal. Our results are summarized as follows: (1) Seven of 12 patients had adequate mean repetition rates; that is, they fulfilled the task requirements on a global scale. The remaining five patients had various degrees of hastened responses and were not fully able to synchronize their movements to an external pacing signal. (b) PD patients exhibited hypometria in their finger tapping, but not in their lip movements. Their movements were not abnormally slowed, but peak velocity was appropriately scaled, even to reduced movement amplitudes. (c) Mean repetition rates, stability of frequency response, and kinematics did not differ between conditions of external and internal stimulation within the PD group, but were different form the control group performance. (d) Kinematic measures were not improved during dual-task execution. PD patients were not able to maintain a 1:1 rhythm between effectors. The incidence of hastening increased during simultaneous motor execution. We conclude that the use of external pacing signals might aid movement initiation of PD patients, but does not improve their temporal or spatial coordination when generating repetitive movements. Simultaneous execution does not necessarily enhance motor performance, but might actually have detrimental effects in patients prone to hastening.

AB  - Substantial evidence suggests that not only does the structure of the cardiac extracellular matrix affect the mechanical properties of myocardium, but that mechanical loading affects the synthesis of the extracellular matrix. However, loading conditions in vivo are nonhomogeneous and multiaxial. An experimental approach that combines mechanics and cell biology is used to examine the mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling in the heart. The results indicate that differential biological responses in adult cardiac fibroblasts can be correlated with specific physical signals, such as the magnitude and two dimensional (2D) pattern of strain.

TI  - [Effectiveness of peroxide solutions against microorganisms in biofilms]  
AB  - Central dosing units for surface disinfectants can constitute a particular hygiene problem in hospitals if a biofilm can develop in the piping system despite the disinfectant solution that is present. In earlier studies it was able to be shown that oxygen-releasing compounds in particular were highly effective against microorganisms in generated biofilms. The purpose of the study presented was to investigate in a test simulating practical conditions whether, in addition to the described good effect, peroxide-containing solutions also have a uniform effect against all isolates from disinfectant use-solutions, or whether there are differences. The results show that a 1% H2O2 solution (C) was not sufficiently effective against all test organisms after a contact time of one hour. In contrast, the 1% test solution of A (10% perglutaric acid, 28% H2O2, < 0.5% perbenzoic acid) was highly and uniformly effective. The 3% test solution of B (10% tertiary butylhydroperoxide, 20% phenoxypropanols, 48% dipropylene glycol) exhibited weaknesses against some test organisms after the one-hour contact time. After a contact time of three hours, this solution, unlike the 1% H2O2 solution achieved a reduction in bacterial count of more than 5 log steps against all species. On the basis of these results, before cleaning piping systems it appears advisable to test the effectiveness of the solution to be used in a suitable test with the isolates.

AB  - Macromolecular crowding conditions occurring inside the cell nucleus were reproduced experimentally with solutions of mononucleosome core particles to study their supramolecular organization. We report here that under these conditions, and over a large range of monovalent salt concentrations, mononucleosome core particles self-assemble to form a discotic liquid crystalline phase characterized in polarizing and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Mononucleosomes are stacked on each other to form columns, which are themselves closely packed into an hexagonal array. The nucleosome concentration, estimated from the network parameters, falls in the range of values measured in cell nuclei. We suggest that these concentrated solutions, although their organization cannot be immediately compared to the organization of chromatin in vivo, may be used to investigate the nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Furthermore, this approach may be complexified to take into account the complexity of the eucaryotic chromatin.

TI  - Metabolic effects and cellular volume responses induced by noradrenaline in nucleated erythrocytes.  
AB  - The mechanism of adrenergic swelling, cAMP accumulation and associated Na+ and K+ concentration changes was investigated in amphibian Rana ridibunda erythrocytes. The addition of noradrenaline to an isotonic suspension of red cells of frog Rana ridibunda in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyryl-methylxanthine (IBMX), induced a significant increase of the cell volume. Forskolin treatment showed analogous results. The removal of the Na+ from the incubation medium, inhibited the volume changes caused by either noradrenaline or forskolin.  Under the same conditions a more than two-fold increase of lactate formation, 260% increase of glucose consumption and accumulation of cAMP were found. These effects are specific and rapid. The peak of lactate production at 7.5 min was followed by a slow further decrease, whereas cAMP reached a plateau after 15 min. The increased glycolytic rate is probably the consequence of an activation of phosphofructokinase by cAMP. When the red cells were incubated in the presence of either noradrenaline or the cAMP analog, dibutyryl-cAMP the intracellular concentration of Na+ was significantly increased by the first 7.5 min of incubation compared with the initial values. Both the adrenergic activation and dibutyryl-cAMP treatment induced an intracellular decrease in the K+ content by 15%. In the presence of amiloride the Na+ and the K+ content of erythrocytes remained unaltered. Cellular swelling may be a prerequisitive for activation of Na+ and K+ movements. These findings suggest a regulatory role of cAMP in the energy metabolism of Rana ridibunda erythrocytes. In addition, the adrenergic responses were rapid and specific to alpha 1 and beta-antagonists.

TI  - Secondary ischemic tolerance improved by administration of L-NAME in rat flaps.  
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) under basal conditions is an important regulator of vascular tone. Under ischemic conditions, however, NO can combine with superoxide anion to produce the damaging hydroxyl free radical. The current project observes the effect of inhibiting NO production (L-Nitro-amino-methyl-arginine, L-NAME) on flaps rendered ischemic by secondary (2 degrees) venous obstruction. Eighty rats had 3 x 6 cm skin flaps based on the epigastric vessels. Primary (1 degree) ischemia was produced by arteriovenous occlusion for 2 hours; (2 degrees) venous ischemia was induced by clamping the vein, alone for either 3 or 5 hours. Thirty minutes prior to 2 degrees ischemia, rats received either L-NAME (30 mg/kg) or saline buffer. Flap survival was assessed 7 days later and Chi-square analysis was used. At 3 hours of ischemia, treatment improved survival from 55% to 85% (P < 0.05). Treatment also improved survival at 5 hours of ischemia from 5% to 35% (P < 0.04). Although under resting conditions, NO is a potent vasodilator, during 2 degrees venous obstruction it may contribute to flap necrosis.

AB  - The expression of the angiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PIGF) was demonstrated in isolated human term cytotrophoblast and in vitro differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. RNase protection assays demonstrated VEGF expression in both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast while prominent PIGF expression was detected in both types of trophoblast by Northern blot analyses. VEGF expression increased approximately eightfold in trophoblast cultured under hypoxic conditions (1 per cent O2) yet PIGF expression decreased 73 +/- 5.5 per cent in the same trophoblast. These results suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms govern expression of VEGF and PIGF in trophoblast. Characterization of the VEGF/PIGF receptors, KDR and flt-1, revealed the presence of flt-1 mRNA in isolated cytotrophoblast and in vitro differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. KDR was not detected in the isolated trophoblast. Exogenous rhVEGF induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in the normal trophoblast indicating that the flt-1 receptors on trophoblast are functional. Trophoblast-derived VEGF/PIGF could act in a paracrine fashion to promote uterine angiogenesis and vascular permeability within the placental bed. In addition, presence of function flt-1 on normal trophoblast suggests that VEGF/PIGF functions in an autocrine manner to perform an as yet undefined role in trophoblast invasion, differentiation, and/or metabolic activity during placentation.

TI  - No increase in carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide during addition of lamotrigine treatment in children.  
AB  - It has been suggested that lamotrigine (LTG) may enhance the toxicity of carbamazepine (CBZ) by increasing the concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) in adult patients. The authors investigated this hypothesis in an add-on study in 11 children and 3 adolescents, aged 6-22 years, who had been treated for more than 1 year with CBZ in monotherapy or with CBZ in combination with one or two other antiepileptic drugs. The LTG dosage was increased step by step until clinical response or side effects were observed. The plasma concentrations of LTG, CBZ, and CBZ-E were monitored during steady state conditions before and after the addition of LTG. It was found that LTG had no effect on mean CBZ concentrations and that it decreased rather than increased the mean plasma concentration of CBZ-E from 6.4 +/- 2.6 to 4.9 +/- 2.4 mumol/l (mean +/- SD, n = 14, P = 0.019). Observed side effects were diplopia in two children, agitation in two, and increased number of seizures in one. None of these five patients had unusually high CBZ-E levels when the side effect developed. It is concluded that addition of lamotrigine in children treated with carbamazepine children does not result in a pharmacokinetic interaction with a toxic accumulation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide.

TI  - Role of endothelial dysfunction in coronary artery disease and implications for therapy.  
AB  - Atherosclerosis is a complex process that is characterized by the accumulation of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL), local inflammatory and immune responses, and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability within the arterial wall. These cellular changes lead to endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, plaque instability, and the development of clinical events such as stable angina and the acute coronary syndromes. The vascular endothelium plays a critical role in modulating both the inflammatory response and vasomotor abnormalities that occur in those with coronary artery disease or risk factors for disease. In these conditions, endothelial cells are activated by cytokines to express cellular adhesion molecules that facilitate the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium, and their migration into the subintimal space. Cytokines stimulate inflammatory and smooth muscle cells in the intima to produce degradative enzymes, including metalloproteinases that can weaken the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic lesions and make them vulnerable to rupture. Endothelial cells also regulate vascular tone by the synthesis of nitric oxide. Atherosclerosis and other conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease are associated with endothelial vasodilator dysfunction in the coronary epicardial and resistance vessels, which likely contributes to myocardial ischemia. Several studies have demonstrated that lowering serum total and LDL cholesterol reverses endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, reduces myocardial ischemia, and lowers the risk of the acute coronary syndromes or need for revascularization. Improving endothelial function, for example, by lowering blood cholesterol should now be regarded as a goal of therapy in the treatment of coronary artery disease.

TI  - Mechanism of formation of novel covalent drug.DNA interstrand cross-links and monoadducts by enediyne antitumor antibiotics.  
AB  - The potent enediyne antitumor antibiotic C1027 has been previously reported to induce novel DNA interstrand cross-links and drug monoadducts under anaerobic conditions [Xu et al. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 1133-1134]. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of formation of these anaerobic DNA lesions. We found that, similar to the aerobic reaction, the diradical species of the activated drug initiates anaerobic DNA damage by abstracting hydrogen atoms from the C4', C1', and C5' positions of the A1, A2, and A3 nucleotides, respectively, in the most preferred 5'GTTA1T/5'ATA2A3C binding sequence. It is proposed that the newly generated deoxyribosyl radicals, which cannot undergo oxidation, likely add back onto the nearby unsaturated ring system of the postactivated enediyne core, inducing the formation of interstrand cross-links, connecting either A1 to A2 or A1 to A3, or drug monoadducts mainly on A2 or A3. Comparative studies with other enediynes, such as neocarzinostatin and calicheamicin gamma 1I under similar reaction conditions indicate that the anaerobic reaction process is a kinetically competitive one, depending on the proximity of the drug unsaturated ring system or dioxygen to the sugar radicals and their quenching by other hydrogen sources such as solvent or thiols. It was found that C1027 mainly generates interstrand cross-links, whereas most of the anaerobic lesions produced by neocarzinostatin are drug monoadducts. Calicheamicin gamma 1 (1) was found to be less efficient in producing both lesions. The anaerobic DNA lesions induced by enediyne antitumor antibiotics may have important implications for their potent cytotoxicity in the central regions of large tumors, where relative anaerobic conditions prevail.

TI  - Role of the Na+/K+-ATPase in regulating the membrane potential in rat peritoneal mast cells.  
AB  - 1. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Na+/K+-ATPase on the membrane potential of peritoneal mast cells isolated from male Sprague-Dawley SPF-rats. 2. Experiments were performed at 22-26 degrees C in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique by use of Sylgard-coated patch pipettes (3-6 M[omega]). High-resolution membrane currents were recorded with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier controlled by the 'E9SCREEN' software. In addition, a charting programme on another computer synchronously recorded at low resolution (2 Hz) membrane potential and holding current (low-pass filtered at 500 Hz). 3. Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured as the ouabain-sensitive change in the zero-current potential. The zero-current potential in rat peritoneal mast cells measured 2 min after obtaining whole-cell configuration amounted to 1.7 +/- 2.5 mV (n = 21). Ouabain (5 mM), a Na+/K+-ATPase-inhibitor, had only a very minor effect upon the membrane potential under resting conditions (n = 3). 4. When mast cells were superfused with nominal calcium-free external solution, the cells hyperpolarized (delta mV: 20.2 +/- 3.8 mV (n = 5)). In addition, when the mast cells were preincubated in nominal calcium-free external solution for 12 +/- 1.6 min before whole-cell configuration, the membrane potential amounted to -53.7 +/- 9.8 mV (n = 8). A subsequent superfusion with ouabain (5 mM) depolarized the membrane potential (ouabain-sensitive hyperpolarization (delta mV): 23.0 +/- 8.4 mV (n = 8)). 5. A high intracellular concentration of Na+ ([Na+]i) (26.6 mM) also resulted in hyperpolarization (delta mV: 20.2 +/- 9.1 mV (n = 7)), but only when ATP was present. A subsequent superfusion with ouabain (5 mM) repolarized these cells to -1.2 +/- 14 mV (ouabain-sensitive hyperpolarization (delta mV): 19.7 +/- 7.7 mV (n = 7)). 6. The size of the [Na+]i-dependent hyperpolarization was dose-dependent. Low [Na+]i (1 mM) had no effect on membrane potential and these cells were unaffected by superfusion with calcium-free external solution. 7. These data thus directly confirm that the stimulant effect of calcium-free external solutions on the ouabain-sensitive changes in the zero-current potential, and hence the Na+/K+-ATPase, is mediated through [Na+]i and that the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase can have an important influence on the resting membrane potential in rat peritoneal mast cells.

TI  - A highly adherent phenotype associated with virulent Bvg+-phase swine isolates of Bordetella bronchiseptica grown under modulating conditions.  
AB  - The ability of Bvg(-)-phase and Bvg(+)-phase Bordetella bronchiseptica swine isolates, grown under modulating or nonmodulating conditions, to adhere to swine ciliated nasal epithelial cells was determined. When virulent strains were cultivated at 37 degrees C in the Bvg+ phase, numerous adherent bacteria (approximately eight per cell, depending on the strain used) were observed. However, when such strains were grown under modulating conditions (23 degrees C), a significant increase in the level of attachment was seen, suggesting that B. bronchiseptica produces a Bvg-repressed adhesin under these conditions. bvg mutant strains, including an isogenic bvgS mutant, adhered minimally. Western blots indicated that two putative B. bronchiseptica adhesins, filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin, were not detectable in cultures displaying the highly adherent phenotype. Several proteins apparent in Western blots obtained by using bacterial extracts enriched in outer membrane proteins derived from B. bronchiseptica grown at 23 degrees C were not present in similar extracts prepared from an isogenic bvgS mutant grown at 23 degrees C or from the parent strain grown at 37 degrees C. Adherence of bacteria cultivated at 23 degrees C was almost completely abolished by pretreatment of organisms at 60 degrees C; adherence was reduced by 57% when bacteria were pretreated with pronase E. Temperature shift experiments revealed that the heightened level of adhesion that occurs following growth at 23 degrees C was maintained for up to 18 h when bacteria were subsequently incubated at 37 degrees C. We propose that a Bvg-repressed adhesin, expressed only by modulated bvg+ strains of B. bronchiseptica, may play a key role in the initial colonization of naturally infected swine.

TI  - Lesions of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and classical eyeblink conditioning under less-than-optimal stimulus conditions: role of partial reinforcement and interstimulus interval.  
AB  - Rabbits received lesions of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) or sham lesions and were subjected to classical eyeblink (EB) and heart rate (HR) conditioning. Separate groups of sham and lesioned animals received either 50% or 25% reinforcement with a periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus. Other groups received an interstimulus interval of either 1.0 or 1.5 s. Animals with MD lesions acquired the EB conditioned response (CR) more slowly than sham-lesioned animals with either the 1.5-s ISI or with the 25% reinforcement schedule. The lesions had no significant effect on the HR CR, however. Results suggest that information processed by MD is relayed to the prefrontal cortex and is required for somatomotor response selection under nonoptimal learning conditions.

TI  - Breast disease: a primer on diagnosis and management.  
AB  - Currently, mammography is the only method of detecting nonpalpable, early breast cancer. At this stage, 90% of the cancers are curable. Clearly, this fundamental tenet accentuates the importance of compliance and knowledge of guidelines. Although risks of mammography are minimal to nil, interpretation occasionally can be challenging, with equivocal results. New technologies are being evaluated and advances in measurement of cellular electrical potential differentials in breast tissue have produced exciting results, when compared with mammography and ultrasound. These screening efforts have increased the diagnosis of both invasive and noninvasive ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast. For DCIS in particular, conservative, contemporary treatment options exist. These include lumpectomy with breast irradiation excluding axillary dissection. Selected patients may be treated with only lumpectomy. Although breast carcinoma is a major focus due to incidence, morbidity and mortality, the varieties of benign conditions cause many women genuine concern. Treatment options for fibrocystic change run a gamut, including cost-effective basic dietary changes, vitamin use, "health"/natural type treatments, analgesic, as well as hormonal manipulations and, on occasion, surgical intervention. Fortunately, with most patients, common sense and conservatism prevail. The presence of fibroadenomas diagnosed clinically, by ultrasound or mammography, in women aged 18-25 and beyond can create perplexing diagnostic dilemmas. Should the lesion be removed or observed? Differences of opinion exist and must be tempered by recent observations that women with complex fibroadenomas, sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcification or papillary appocrine changes have a two- to threefold increased risk of breast cancer. The key to management in all these clinical situations is individualization. Conservatism is particularly acceptable in women under the age of 25 if a fibroadenoma is not increasing in size or not psychologically disturbing. Provoked or unprovoked nipple discharge is a clinical conundrum for patients. It is unsuspected and unwanted. While some whitish discharges result from stimulation or medication, others may have a more subtle etiology. Serous, serosanguineous, or bloody discharges mandate evaluation. Duct injection mammography and frequent excision of ductal systems are necessary. The clinician cannot forget other less common conditions, such as thrombophlebitis, fat necrosis, or infection. All clinical conditions of the breast provide a constellation of diagnostic and management problems. They are of real concern for every woman and must be resolved in an appropriate, prompt, and conscientious fashion.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins-3 and -5 form sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable multimers.  
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are important modulators of IGF actions. IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 can bind to the extracellular matrix of a number of cell types. We now describe a new posttranslational structural modification of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, which could play a role in determining their localization. We incubated radioiodinated forms of all six IGFBPs in the presence of a redox buffer consisting of 10 mM reduced glutathione and 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione.  Under these conditions IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, but not the other IGFBPs, formed high molecular weight disulfide-linked multimers. Heparin and a peptide encompassing the high-affinity heparin-binding site in the C-terminal portion of IGFBP-3 were capable of blocking the multimerization of IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3, but not IGFBP-1, was shown to be able to self-associate non-covalently, which could be a requisite first step in the formation of covalent multimers. The self-association of IGFBP-3 required the high-affinity heparin-binding site in the C-terminal portion of the molecule.

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22181-22187], we studied the interaction of non-SH-reactive eosin Y, an analog of EMA, with the carrier under various conditions to characterize its binding. Eosin Y was found to inhibit ADP transport by binding to loop M2 in submitochondrial particles, but not in mitochondria. Its Ki for transport (0.33 microM) was found to be very similar to its Kd (0.53 microM) for specific binding to the carrier. Bound eosin Y was displaced by the transport substrates ADP and ATP, but not by untransportable GTP, suggesting that eosin Y bound to the specific binding site of ADP and ATP. The three-dimensional structure and electrostatic features of eosin Y were very similar to those of ADP, and the hydrophobic property and divalent charge of eosin Y were very important for its binding to the carrier. Based on these results, the features of the binding site of the transport substrates are considered.

AB  - The effects of the composition of bacteriological growth media on the light output in a chemiluminometric assay of beta-galactosidase in Escherichia coli using 1,2-dioxetane substrates has been studied. In this assay a basic conflict exists between conditions that promote optimal bacterial growth and those conducive to maximal chemiluminescence. Common medium ingredients such as yeast or beef extract, protein hydrolysates and lactose suppress light emission and/or lead to high backgrounds. Quenching of light emission is probably partly due to light absorption by medium ingredients such as oxgall, and partly to interference with the reaction triggering the chemiluminescent process. Elevated backgrounds are caused by the presence of high concentrations of protein hydrolysates, which interact with the alkali in the accelerator solution. Only two purposely developed media, i.e. ILM and Colicult are shown to reconcile the requirements of growth support with that of optimal luminescent properties.

TI  - Transcriptional control of several aerobically induced cytochrome structural genes in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  
AB  - To decipher how the synthesis of energy-transducing enzymes responds to environmental cues, the response of three Rhodobacter sphaeroides aerobic cytochrome gene promoters was analysed under different conditions. Two of these promoters are upstream of structural genes (ctaD and coxII) for individual subunits of the cytochrome aa3 respiratory complex. The third promoter is that for the cycFG operon, which encodes two c-type cytochromes of unknown function, cytochrome c554 and CycG. Primer extension analysis identified a single oxygen-responsive transcription start site for each gene. Utilizing operon fusions to Escherichia coli lacZ as a measure of promoter activity, transcription from the ctaD, coxII and cycFG promoters was approximately twofold higher when cells were grown at high (30%) oxygen tensions than under low (2%) oxygen or anaerobic (photosynthetic) conditions. Analysis of promoter function using specific host mutations indicated that loss of the R. sphaeroides FNR homologue, FnrL, causes a small, but reproducible, increase in cycFG and coxII transcription when cells are grown at 2% oxygen. However, neither the delta FnrL mutation nor alterations in sequences related to a consensus target site for the E. coli FNR protein increased function of any of these three promoters to that seen under aerobic conditions in wild-type cells. From this we conclude that FnrL is not solely responsible for reduced transcription of these three aerobic cytochrome genes under low oxygen or anaerobic conditions. When activity of these three promoters was monitored after cells were shifted from anaerobic (photosynthetic) conditions to a 30% oxygen atmosphere, it took several cell doublings for LacZ levels to increase to those found in steady-state 30% oxygen cultures. From these results, it appears that activity of these promoters is also regulated by a stable molecule whose synthesis or function responds slowly to the presence of high oxygen tensions.

TI  - Mechanisms of mechanical load-induced atrial natriuretic peptide secretion: role of endothelin, nitric oxide, and angiotensin II.  
AB  - There are three members in the natriuretic peptide hormone family, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, brain natriuretic peptide), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), that are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. CNP is found principally in the central nervous system and vascular endothelial cells while ANP and BNP are cardiac hormones. ANP is synthesized mainly in the atria of the normal adult heart, while BNP is produced by both the atria and ventricles. The mechanisms controlling ANP release have been the subject of intense research, and are now fairly well understood. The major determinant of ANP secretion is myocyte stretch. Although much less is known about the factors regulating BNP release from the heart, myocyte stretch has also been reported to stimulate BNP release from both atria and ventricles. However, whether wall stretch acts directly or via factors such as endothelin- , nitric oxide, or angiotensin II liberated in response to distension has not been established. Recent studies show that by stimulating endothelin type A receptors endothelin plays an important physiological role as a mediator of acute-volume load-induced ANP secretion from atrial myocytes in conscious animals. In fact, endogenous paracrine/autocrine factors liberated in response to atrial wall stretch rather than direct stretch appears to be responsible for activation of ANP secretion in response to volume load, as evidenced by almost complete blockade of ANP secretion during combined inhibition of endothelin type A/B and angiotensin II receptors. Furthermore, under certain experimental conditions angiotensin II and nitric oxide may also exert a significant modulatory effect on stretch-activated ANP secretion. The molecular mechanisms by which endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and nitric oxide synergistically regulate stretch-activated ANP release are yet unclear.

TI  - Conditioned taste aversion produced by cyclosporine A: concomitant reduction in lymphoid organ weight and splenocyte proliferation.  
AB  - The classical conditioning of immune parameters is commonly conducted within a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. In this study, the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) was investigated for its ability to produce both taste aversion to a novel stimulus and conditioned alterations in immune functioning. The paradigm comprised the pairing of a 0.2% saccharin solution (the conditioned stimulus; CS) with an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg CsA (the unconditioned stimulus; UCS). Upon saccharin re-presentation, a marked reduction in fluid consumption was observed, indicating aversion to the novel substance (=CTA). By using a single CsA/saccharin pairing the CTA lasted for one CS representation. However, by implementing three pairings, this effect could be extended for up to seven representations. No noticeable difference was recorded by adjusting the saccharin representation from every consecutive day to every second day. The most effective paradigm in creating CTA was subsequently investigated for its effectiveness in producing conditioned immune alterations. Animals were killed on the day of the third CS re-presentation, and immune functions assessed.  Conditioned animals displayed a significant reduction in thymus and spleen weights. Effects on the spleen were further investigated, revealing a significantly reduced proliferative ability of isolated splenocytes to concanavalin A. These results demonstrate that the physiological effects produced by CsA are sufficiently salient to elicit CTA. Furthermore, the reduction in lymphoid organ weight and splenocyte proliferation induced by CsA are also conditionable using this paradigm.

AB  - Total protein synthesis (as precipitable [3H] leucine incorporation) was determined under various experimental conditions to examine the relationship between cellular K+ and protein synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We found that under normal external K+ concentration (5 mM), total protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide and ouabain, with estimated values of IC50 of 0.41 microM and 0.60 mM, respectively. Cellular K+ concentrations were determined (102 +/- 4 mM for control cells) and found to be significantly increased (P < 0.01) by high external K+ (25 mM) and significantly decreased (P < 0.001) by low external K+ (0.5 mM) as well as by ouabain (2 mM). Under high external K+, total protein synthesis and the inhibitory responses of cycloheximide and ouabain were not altered. On the contrary, cellular K+ and protein synthesis were both further reduced by about half (P < 0.001) under low external K+. While ouabain further reduced cellular K+ by half (P < 0.001), protein synthesis was only slightly reduced (P < 0.05) under low external K+ and thus the relative reduction on protein synthesis was much less than that for cellular K+. These results indicate that while elevated intracellular K+ did not alter protein synthesis, reduced intracellular K+ correlated with a reduced cellular protein synthesis in HUVEC such that K+ may play a permissible role in the regulation of protein synthesis.

AB  - The anaerobic biodegradation of monobrominated phenols and benzoic acids by microorganisms enriched from marine and estuarine sediments was determined in the presence of different electron acceptors [i.e., Fe(III), SO4(2-), or HCO3-]. Under all conditions tested, the bromophenol isomers were utilized without a lengthy lag period whereas the bromobenzoate isomers were utilized only after a lag period of 23 to 64 days. 2-Bromophenol was debrominated to phenol, with the subsequent utilization of phenol under all three reducing conditions. Debromination of 3-bromophenol and 4-bromophenol was also observed under sulfidogenic and methanogenic conditions but not under iron-reducing conditions. In the bromobenzoate-degrading cultures, no intermediates were observed under any of the conditions tested. Debromination rates were higher under methanogenic conditions than under sulfate-reducing or iron-reducing conditions. The stoichiometric reduction of sulfate or Fe(III) and the utilization of bromophenols and phenol indicated that biodegradation was coupled to sulfate or iron reduction, respectively. The production of phenol as a transient intermediate demonstrates that reductive dehalogenation is the initial step in the biodegradation of bromophenols under iron- and sulfate-reducing conditions.

TI  - Antibiotics: neuropsychiatric effects and psychotropic interactions.  
AB  - Antibiotics are the second most commonly prescribed class of medication in the United States. An awareness and understanding of their potential effects on the central nervous system and their interactions with psychotropic agents is important in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in patients. Since the introduction of antibiotic agents in the 1930s, numerous (primarily anecdotal) reports have appeared describing psychiatric side effects ranging from anxiety and panic to major depression, psychosis, and delirium in patients with and without a premorbid psychiatric history. Risk factors have included prior psychopathology, coexisting medical conditions, slow acetylator status, advanced age, concomitant medications, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, as well as high antibiotic dosage and intrathecal or intravenous administration. Psychiatric toxicity may result from various mechanisms of action, including antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid or pyridoxine, adverse interactions with alcohol, or inhibition of protein synthesis. Adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and concomitant medications including lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, methadone, and disulfiram have also been reported. Because such effects are often not recognized by clinicians, accurate epidemiologic data on their incidence are not available.

TI  - Nucleosome structural transition during chromatin unfolding is caused by conformational changes in nucleosomal DNA.

Chem. 271, 3831-3836). In this work, we demonstrate that these alterations are caused by a conformational change in the nucleosomal DNA. Using zero-length protein-DNA cross-linking, we have mapped histone-DNA contacts in isolated core particles at ionic conditions affecting DNA stiffness, which may change the nucleosomal DNA conformation. We found that the alterations in histone-DNA contacts induced by an increase in DNA stiffness in isolated core particles are identical to those observed in nucleosomes during chromatin unfolding. The change in the pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion of linker histone-depleted chromatin at ionic conditions affecting chromatin compaction also suggests that the stretching of the linker DNA may alter the nucleosomal DNA conformation, resulting in a structural transition in the nucleosome which may play a role in rendering the nucleosome competent for transcription and/or replication.

TI  - Evaluation of methods for isolation of DNA from slowly and rapidly growing mycobacteria.  
AB  - Mycobacteria generally have thick cell walls and contain large amounts of lipid, making them resistant to DNA extraction. Five methods, namely, extensive enzymic digestion method (M1), 2-min mechanical glass-bead disruption method (M2), thermal shock method (M3), modified conventional enzymic digestion method (M4), and manual disruption with modified conventional enzymic digestion method (M5), were used to compare their effectiveness and simplicity in extracting DNA from slowly growing mycobacteria (Mycobacterium leprae, M. lepraemurium and M. bovis BCG), and a rapidly growing mycobacterium (M. phlei). The highest DNA yield was obtained by M2 from M. lepraemurium which produced 2.82 micrograms DNA/mg wet weight of cells, representing a theoretical yield of 78%. M3 gave the lowest DNA yield; 0.01 microgram DNA/mg wet weight of cells of M. lepraemurium was obtained. M4, in which proteinase K was used, is more effective than M1, in which subtilisin and pronase were used. M5 yielded a higher amount of DNA, but it required more manipulations to extract DNA as compared to M4. Extraction of DNA of M. leprae from nude mice is more difficult than that of M. leprae from armadillos by all of the methods used. These results suggest that the biosynthetic capabilities of these two forms of M. leprae may vary, depending on their cultural conditions and/or strain differences. Our results have shown that both M2 and M4 are the simplest, most effective and time-saving methods which are suitable for every routine laboratory to extract DNA from slowly and rapidly growing mycobacteria.

TI  - Stress response in a leporine renal cell model.  
AB  - It is well established that renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells grown under standard in vitro conditions attenuate many of their in vivo properties and functions. Thus, the study of renal stress response mechanisms requires an appropriate cell culture model. In the present study, we compared the heat stress (10 min, 45 degrees C) response of freshly isolated RPT cells with that of RPT cells grown in vitro for 6 days under two different culture conditions: (1) SHAKE conditions, where oxygen levels and physiological functions are maintained via continuous media motion [Nowak G, Schnellmann RG: Am J Physiol 1996;271:C2072-2080] and (2) STILL conditions, involving standard cell culture which leads to partial hypoxia and a marked reduction in physiological functions. The freshly isolated RPT cells progressively synthesized heat shock proteins (HSPs) and stress glycoproteins (SGs) during a 3-hour culture period in vitro. Under these conditions, heat stress did not further increase HSP and SG synthesis. In RPT cells grown under SHAKE conditions, HSP70 synthesis was detected 1 h after heat stress and decreased below detection by 3 h. In contrast, the uptake of radiolabeled mannose into (glycoprotein) GP62 (Mr 62,000), GP50, and GP38 was observed in control SHAKE cultures and was not further increased after heat stress. These results are consistent with immunohistochemistry studies, where similar changes in HSP70 and GP50 expression were noted. RPT cells grown under STILL conditions showed both increased synthesis of HSP70 and increased glycosylation of GP62, GP50, and GP38 as early as 1 h after heat stress, but in contrast to SHAKE conditions, this heat-induced stress response further intensified at 3 h after heat stress. By 7 h after heating, HSP synthesis returned to control levels, while glycosylation of GP62 and GP50 remained elevated. Based on our results, we conclude that freshly isolated RPT cells exhibit a stress response that may be caused by acute cell isolation/culture stress. While this stress response unfolds, freshly isolated RPT cells appear unable to respond to additional heat stress. RPT cells grown under SHAKE and STILL conditions exhibit high rates of SG glycosylation, especially that of GP62, possibly reflecting a 'stress' condition associated with growth on plastic substrate. Concurrently, RPT cells from STILL cultures show a higher capacity for responding to acute heat stress than SHAKE cultures, evidenced by the transiently increased HSP synthetic rates. The interpretation of the renal stress response capacity, therefore, must be linked to a specific culture condition.

TI  - Hemiretinal contribution to the timing of the full-field PVEP as determined with the motor reaction time.  
AB  - With the use of the simple motor reaction time (RT), we examined the contribution of the hemiretinas to the timing of the pattern reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP). RTs were obtained to the reversal of a progressively dimmer check falling either on the central, nasal, temporal, superior or inferior retina. Results were correlated with the peak time of the P1 wave evoked to the reversal of the entire checkerboard stimulus to the same luminance conditions as that used to generate the RT measurements. Our results clearly indicate that the time taken to trigger a manual response depends not only on the luminance of the stimulus, but also on where it falls on the retina. Comparing the above data with the peak time of the PVEP obtained to the reversal of the entire screen indicates that at brighter luminance the peak time of the P1 wave correlates with that measured from the most central retina, while at dimmer intensities it correlates with the mathematical average of all the retinal locations tested.

TI  - NCS-MPP (4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2"-pyridyl)-p-isothiocyanobenz amido]-ethyl-piperazine): a high affinity and irreversible 5-HT1A receptor ligand.  
AB  - A novel irreversible 5-HT1A receptor binding ligand, NCS-MPP (4-(2'- methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2"-pyridyl)-p-isothiocyanobenzamido]- ethyl-piperazine), based on the new 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI (4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2"-pyridyl)-p-iodobenzamido]-ethyl -piperazine ), was synthesized, and its binding characteristics were evaluated using in vitro homogenate binding with rat hippocampal membranes. The Ki value of NCS-MPP was estimated to be 1.8 +_ 0.2 nM using analysis of concentration-dependent inhibition for the binding of [125I]p-MPPI to 5-HT1A receptors. NovaScreen of NCS-MPP showed low to moderate binding affinities to alpha-1, alpha-2-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors, with Ki values of 350, 420, and 103 nM, respectively. These data strongly suggest that the ligand bound to 5-HT1A receptors with high affinity and high selectivity. Irreversible inhibition of [125I]p-MPPI binding by NCS-MPP following a 5 min incubation at room temperature was concentration dependent; the inhibition increased to 50% at a concentration less than 10 nM, and became more pronounced (90%) at 400 nM.  Under similar assay conditions, NCS-MPP was significantly less efficient in irreversibly inhibiting agonist ligand [125I]8-OH-PIPAT binding to 5-HT1A receptors at lower concentrations (<10nM). After pretreatment of membranes with a low concentration of NCS-MPP (2nM), there was an apparent loss of [125I]p-MPPI binding sites, as expected, but no change in the binding affinity (Kd) was observed. However, the significant increase in Kd at a higher concentration of NCS-MPP (50 nM) indicated that there may be a secondary alkylation site, which may not be directly involved in p-MPPI binding to receptors; nevertheless, it would lead to an increased Kd value. The availability of an irreversible ligand, NCS-MPP, may provide a useful tool for studies of 5-HT1A receptors in the central nervous system.

TI  - Bicarbonate therapy and intracellular acidosis.  
AB  - 1. The correction of metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. Experiments in vitro have suggested possible deleterious effects after alkalinization of the extracellular fluid. Disequilibrium of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate across cell membranes after alkali administration, leading to the phenomenon of 'paradoxical' intracellular acidosis, has been held responsible for some of these adverse effects. 2. Changes in intracellular pH in suspensions of leucocytes from healthy volunteers were monitored using a fluorescent intracellular dye. The effect in vitro of increasing extracellular pH with sodium bicarbonate was studied at different sodium bicarbonate concentrations. Lactic acid and propionic acid were added to the extracellular buffer to mimic conditions of metabolic acidosis. 3. The addition of a large bolus of sodium bicarbonate caused intracellular acidification as has been observed previously. The extent of the intracellular acidosis was dependent on several factors, being most evident at higher starting intracellular pH. When sodium bicarbonate was added as a series of small boluses the reduction in intracellular pH was small. Under conditions of initial acidosis this was rapidly followed by intracellular alkalinization. 4. Although intracellular acidification occurs after addition of sodium bicarbonate to a suspension of human leucocytes in vitro, the effect is minimal when the conditions approximate those seen in clinical practice. We suggest that the observed small and transient lowering of intracellular pH is insufficient grounds in itself to abandon the use of sodium bicarbonate in human acidosis.

TI  - HLA-C heavy chains free of beta2-microglobulin: distribution in normal tissues and neoplastic lesions of non-lymphoid origin and interferon-gamma responsiveness.  
AB  - Lacking monospecific antibodies to HLA-C, the expression and synthesis of these molecules have been difficult to evaluate. Using biochemical and flow cytometry approaches, the present report demonstrates that the reactivity of the murine monoclonal antibody L31 is restricted to naturally occurring HLA-C (HLA-Cw1 through -Cw8), HLA-B8 and HLA-B51 heavy chains not associated with beta2-microglobin (beta2m). This is due to two properties of HLA-C heavy chains: (a) they share the L31 epitope which distinguishes them from all the HLA-A and most HLA-B molecules; (b) they accumulate intracellularly, in a beta2m-free form, in much greater amounts than most L31-reacting HLA-B heavy chains. On the basis of this restricted reactivity, a representative panel of normal and neoplastic human tissues and cells derived from HLA-B8- B51- individuals was selected and employed to assess the tissue distribution, surface expression and IFN-gamma responsiveness of beta2m-free HLA-C heavy chains. At variance from antibody W6/32 to beta2m-associated heavy chains, L31 stains normal and neoplastic tissues with a ground-glass pattern and weakly binds to the surface of viable cells, even after treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Thus, beta2m-free HLA-C heavy chains are, for the most part, located intracellularly. In spite of their distinct cellular localization, L31- and W6/32-reacting molecules have an overlapping tissue distribution, undergo concordant changes upon transformation and are upregulated in their synthesis by IFN-gamma to a similar extent. These observations demonstrate a coordinate regulation of HLA-C with HLA-A and -B molecules. In addition, they indicate that the assembly of HLA-C is impaired in most body districts and IFN-gamma is unable to completely reverse this impairment. The present results are consistent with a low surface expression of HLA-C and with a privileged role of these molecules in signaling class I loss to cytotoxic effectors in pathological conditions.

TI  - Development and validation of TMJ viscoelasticity analyzer.  
AB  - We developed a TMJ viscoelasticity analyzer for non-invasive evaluation of the soft tissues of the TMJ region. We used this device to measure the viscoelastic parameters, viscosity (c), elasticity (k) and mass (m), of the TMJ region for two volunteers. Experiments were performed to determine the optimum measurement conditions for the preload magnitude, head posture and clenching level. We determined measurement variability and carried out statistical analysis by analysis of variance (ANOVA). We found that the values for c and k varied significantly depending on preload magnitudes (p < 0.001). In addition, all parameters varied significantly depending on head posture. However, clenching level did not significantly affect any of the parameters. Measurement variability was below 10% for all parameters. Examination of viscoelasticity of the TMJ region provides valuable information about functional and pathological changes in the soft tissues of this area. In this study, we were able to determine the fundamental characteristics of the TMJ viscoelasticity analyzer and develop methods for examining patients with temporomandibular disorders.

TI  - Preferred interaction of D-peptidyl-anthraquinones with double-stranded B-DNA.  
AB  - The quest for more specific drugs in antitumor chemotherapy led us to the design of anthraquinone-peptide conjugates capable of selective recognition of the nucleic acid. We present here the DNA binding characteristics, sequence specificity and geometry of interaction of a pair of enantiomers containing the lysine-glycine dipeptide in the side chains. The D enantiomer binds right handed double stranded DNA more efficiently than the L form under all conditions tested. The source of higher binding affinity is not electrostatic in nature and rests in the more favorable hydrophobic contacts of the D-lysyl side chains in the drug-DNA complex. Both derivatives exhibit preference for alternating GC base sequences and intercalate into DNA in a threading mode as suggested by chiroptical and theoretical studies. The D enantiomer, being a peptidyl derivative that contains a non-natural amino acid, has the considerable advantage of being less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis and could therefore represent a lead compound for further development.

TI  - A chloride-inducible acid resistance mechanism in Lactococcus lactis and its regulation.  
AB  - Previously, a promoter was identified in Lactococcus lactis that is specifically induced by chloride. Here, we describe the nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of two genes transcribed from this promoter, gadC and gadB. GadC is homologous to putative glutamate-gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters of Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri and contains 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. GadB shows similarity to glutamate decarboxylases. A L. lactis gadB mutant and a strain that is unable to express both gadB and gadC was more sensitive to low pH than the wild type when NaCl and glutamate were present. Expression of gadCB in L. lactis in the presence of chloride was increased when the culture pH was allowed to decrease to low levels by omitting buffer from the medium, while glutamate also stimulated gadCB expression. Apparently, these genes encode a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism of L. lactis that is optimally active under conditions in which it is needed to maintain viability. Immediately upstream of the chloride-dependent gadCB promoter Pgad, a third gene encodes a protein (GadR) that is homologous to the activator Rgg from Streptococcus gordonii. gadR expression is chloride and glutamate independent. A gadR mutant did not produce the 3kb gadCB mRNA that is found in wild-type cells in the presence of NaCl, indicating that GadR is an activator of the gadCB operon.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that daily exercise would reduce directly measured arterial blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic nervous system support of BP in conscious, unrestrained, female Dahl salt-sensitive rats consuming 4.0% NaCl. Dahl S/Jr inbred rats were assigned to daily exercise (EX) or sedentary (SED) treatment conditions (n = 12/group) at 4 weeks of age. Rats in the EX group were housed in cages with attached running wheels. After 5 weeks of exercise, rats were running 10.3 +/- 1.7 km/day. After at least 5 wks of treatment, all rats in both groups were placed on a 4.0% NaCl diet for 2 weeks to produce sodium-induced hypertension. Rats continued to either exercise daily or remain sedentary for an additional 2 weeks while consuming the high sodium diet. Carotid and jugular catheters were then implanted for measurements in conscious, resting, unrestrained rats on two separate days. Daily wheel running exercise for 7 to 9 weeks did not alter BP or HR in Dahl S/Jr rats consuming a 4.0% NaCl diet. However, acute arterial depressor responses to ganglionic blockade were less in EX rats. Furthermore, greater alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine-induced) pressor responses were observed in the EX group while under ganglionic blockade. The findings suggest that overall resting sympathetic neural activity or cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness to sympathetic activity is reduced in this model of hypertension by daily wheel running exercise.

TI  - Development, validation and application of an ultra-sensitive two-site enzyme immunoassay for human follistatin.  
AB  - Recent studies have found follistatin to be an important regulator of activin bioactivity. Whilst a number of assay formats have been described, all are of limited sensitivity and require the use of isotopes. Many use polyclonal antibodies. Furthermore, a wide range of follistatin preparations have been used as standards, complicating inter-laboratory comparison. We now describe an ultra-sensitive two-site enzyme immunoassay using a pair of mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against follistatin 288. The presence of sodium deoxycholate and Tween 20 in the diluent gave results for total (free and activin-dissociated) follistatin. The assay had a detection limit of <19 pg/ml and recovery of spiked follistatin 288 from amniotic fluid, serum seminal plasma, human follicular fluid and granulosa cell conditioned medium averaged 100.7 +/- 7.5%, 89.1 +/- 5.5%, 98 +/- 4.9%, 96 +/- 7.2% and 123.9 +/- 11% respectively. The intra- and interplate coefficients of variation were < 5%. An excess of activin-A (50 ng/ml) prior to assay did not affect follistatin recovery. Inhibin-A, inhibin-B, activin-A, activin-B and activin-AB had minimal cross-reactivity (<0.3%). However, follistatin 315 had a significant cross-reaction (9.9%). Serially diluted human samples gave dose-response curves parallel to the standard. Pooled human follicular fluid contained high concentrations of follistatin (approximately 242 ng/ml). Follistatin was also found in maternal serum during pregnancy (first trimester approximately 0.8 ng/ml, third trimester approximately 2.8 ng/ml), normal male serum (approximately 0.45 ng/ml), amniotic fluid (sixteen week approximately 3.63 ng/ml, term approximately 0.89 ng/ml), seminal plasma (2.4-30 ng/ml) and human granulosa cell conditioned media (approximately 0.44 ng/ml). Serial serum samples taken throughout the menstrual cycle of ten women showed fluctuating follistatin concentrations (approximately 0.62 ng/ml) with no apparent relationship to the stage of the cycle. Interestingly, pooled serum from postmenopausal women appeared to have higher follistatin levels than any of the normal women (approximately 1.4 ng/ml). The possible presence in certain samples of mixtures of follistatin isoforms with different immunoreactivities poses major problems of interpretation in this and all other current follistatin immunoassays. Further work is needed to identify the major immunoreactive forms in different tissues and fluids. Nevertheless, the new assay has a number of advantages over previous assays and should prove a useful tool for various clinical and physiological studies.

Thus, extrapolation of measured Vmax values (maximal reaction rates at high substrate concentrations) to in vivo conditions, hence comparison with physiological substrate loads, is uncertain. We therefore have developed a sucrase assay in an intact preparation of mouse small intestine, an everted intestinal sleeve incubated in a physiological Ringer's solution. As in homogenate studies, sucrase is assayed by glucose production measured colorimetrically, but uptake of liberated glucose into the intestinal sleeve is prevented by the transport inhibitor phlorizin. The coefficient of variation of Vmax is 16% for sleeves from the same mouse and 8% for mean values from different mice. Sleeve sucrase activity is abolished by the inhibitor castanospermine. Activity in sleeves and homogenates proves to be the same when measured under identical solution conditions, but variations in assay conditions cause large activity changes from values measured in physiological solutions.

TI  - Differential regulation by estrogens of growth and prolactin synthesis in pituitary cells suggests that only a small pool of estrogen receptors is required for growth.  
AB  - PR1 cells are a prolactin (PRL)-secreting cell line derived from a pituitary lactotroph tumor found in 17beta-estradiol-treated Fischer 344 rats. We examined the effect of estrogen on cell proliferation and PRL synthesis under various culture conditions. Estrogen, at extremely low concentrations, induces cell proliferation in this cell line, whereas antiestrogen inhibits proliferation. Interestingly, the proliferation response is much more sensitive than the PRL response because 0.01 pM estradiol or diethylstilbestrol induces half-maximal growth induction [ approximately 0.1% estrogen receptor (ER) occupancy is required], whereas 0.01 nM concentration is required for half-maximal PRL induction ( approximately 50% ER occupancy is required). The proliferation response is not as sensitive to antiestrogen as the PRL response, because 10 nM concentration of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 could not inhibit 1 nM estradiol- or diethylstilbestrol-induced proliferation. The same concentration of ICI 182,780 decreased PRL secretion to 1% of estradiol- or diethylstilbestrol-induced prolactin secretion suggesting a possible dichotomy of ER control of proliferation and PRL synthesis. The Kd of ER binding in these cells is about 3 x 10(-11) M. These results with the PR1 cells extend previous studies in other estrogen- regulated systems and suggest that only a small pool of ER is required for cell proliferation in contrast with the regulation of expression of specific genes. They also raise questions as to how a dimeric receptor functions when only one ligand site is occupied or when both an estrogen and an antiestrogen occupy one dimer.

TI  - Differential misclassification and the assessment of gene-environment interactions in case-control studies.  
AB  - In case-control studies of interactions between genetic and environmental exposures, differential misclassification of the environmental exposure with respect to disease status can introduce spurious heterogeneity of the stratum-specific odds ratios. In this paper, the authors identify conditions under which differential misclassification does not introduce bias in the interaction parameter when no multiplicative interaction is present, and it biases the interaction parameter toward the null value when a multiplicative interaction is present. The conditions are that (i) conditional on potential confounders, the environmental exposure is independent of the genotype among the controls, and (ii) misclassification of the environmental exposure is nondifferential with respect to the genotype. These conditions can be tested from the misclassified data in the control group, since a test of the independence of the genotype and the misclassified environmental exposure among the controls is a test of the joint hypothesis that conditions (i) and (ii) are both true. Therefore, the authors propose a two-step test for interaction which first tests conditions (i) and (ii) and then goes on to test for interaction, provided the first step hypothesis is not rejected. A summary test procedure to test for gene-environment interactions in the presence of misclassification, based on both a conventional test for interaction and the two-step test, is recommended, and is illustrated with data from a case-control study of the role of diet as a modifier of the association between a metabolic polymorphism and lung cancer.

TI  - Inclusion of cholesterol in DOTAP transfection complexes increases the delivery of DNA to cells in vitro in the presence of serum.  
AB  - The contrast between the relative efficiency of transfection by cationic lipid reagents in vitro and that in vivo is well recognised. One suggested reason for this is the presence of competing polyanionic surfaces in blood and other biological fluids, and even in vitro transfections have to be performed in low-serum medium. In this study we have shown that by preparing cationic lipid reagents based on DOTAP with cholesterol as a second constituent of the bilayer we can achieve significant levels of in vitro transfection in serum concentrations of up to 80% (DOTAP alone did not transfect at all in these conditions). In an effort to explain the behaviour of DOTAP/cholesterol mixes under these conditions, we examined the effect of serum on the transfection complex. We could detect protein bound to each type of cationic lipid complex, but there was no difference in the amount nor in the type of protein bound. DNA within either type of complex which were incubated with increasing amounts of serum remained resistant to digestion with DNase I, and there was no reduction in the condensation of the DNA as measured by ethidium bromide fluorescence. Finally, we measured the attachment and uptake into cells by the different complexes in the presence of serum and showed that more DOTAP-cholesterol than DOTAP complexes attach to and are taken up by cells in the presence of serum. We suggest that improved cell binding and uptake may be the main mechanism by which cholesterol acts to maintain transfection in the presence of serum.

AB  - The stability of cefaclor monohydrate drug substance and formulated products was studied under accelerated conditions in order to provide a rapid indication of differences that might result from a change in manufacturing process or source of the sample. The USP stability-indicating related substances assay was used to assess the extent of sample degradation. An Arrhenius study of drug substance stability from 45 to 70 degrees C predicted a degradation rate consistent with that observed in room-temperature studies. Qualitative degradation profiles of samples held at 65 degrees C for 2 weeks were also very similar to those of samples held at room temperature for 2 years. Based on these results, additional studies were conducted at 65 degrees C for 2 weeks on drug substance and formulated product samples. Stability differences were observed among some capsule formulations that had also exhibited real time differences. In some studies, rapid degradation after 5 days was observed at 65 degrees C followed by a slower rate from 5 to 15 days. Similar behavior was observed for cefaclor monohydrate containing high amounts of amorphous cefaclor, suggesting that differences in amorphous content could be an explanation for stability differences observed in various samples.  The accelerated conditions were shown to differentiate samples and can provide a rapid indication of relative stability.

TI  - Enhancement of tissue factor expression by vein segments exposed to coronary arterial hemodynamics.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Although saphenous vein is the most reliable conduit for arterial interposition procedures in the coronary circulation, graft thrombosis remains a clinical problem. We hypothesized that an important factor in early graft thrombosis is sudden change in the hemodynamic environment of the vein as it is placed in the coronary circulation. METHODS: We used an ex vivo perfusion system to study freshly excised segments of human saphenous vein (HSV) and pig internal jugular vein. For coronary graft (CAVG) simulation, sections of HSV were subjected to arterial pulsatile pressure and flow and twisting and stretching to mimic deformations caused by the beating heart. Using functional and immunohistochemical assays, we investigated the effect of these conditions on expression of tissue factor (TF), an important prothrombotic surface molecule. RESULTS: In each of 11 experiments (6 human, 5 porcine), vein segments from a single donor were subjected to venous conditions (VEN), CAVG perfusion, or no perfusion. Expression of TF was measured as the amount of factor Xa generated per unit area of luminal vein surface. VEN perfusion did not cause a significant change in mean TF expression over nonperfused control values (human: 14.3 +/- 1.5 versus 11.4 +/- 2.3 U/cm2, p = 0.31; pig: 11.6 +/- 1.5 versus 12.5 +/- 1.4 U/cm2, p = 0.70). CAVG perfusion led to significant enhancement of TF expression over VEN perfusion (human: 36.8 +/- 6.2 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05; pig: 40.0 +/- 9.9 versus 11.6 +/- 1.5 U/cm2, p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive TF staining on the luminal side of a CAVG-stimulated HSV segment, but not on a VEN-stimulated segment. In four additional studies, HSV segments were subjected to arterial perfusion without twist and stretch to mimic lower extremity arterial interposition grafts. TF expression for lower extremity venous graft perfusion was significantly higher than for VEN perfusion (25.3 +/- 2.5 versus 14.3 +/- 1.5, p < 0.01) but not significantly different from CAVG perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies in a unique perfusion system suggest that exposure of vein to coronary arterial hemodynamic conditions results in elevated expression of the important prothrombotic molecule TF. This phenomenon may contribute to early graft thrombosis.

In this pilot study we describe the indication of this therapeutic modality in three cirrhotic patients with hemorrhagic congestive gastropathy unresponsive to infusion of drugs that reduce the portal pressure. All of them were treated by TIPS and control of gastric bleeding occurred in all. One of these showed partial stenosis of the wallstent, treated by prosthesis dilatation. Another developed portosystemic encephalopathy controlled by usual therapeutic measures in the other we implanted two TIPS to obtain a low pressure level of the hepatic-portal gradient. They had no further necessity of blood transfusion, with better hemodynamic conditions and biochemical tests with reduction of the values of the GHP. We conclude that TIPS may be useful to treat hemorrhagic congestive gastropathy acting like a bridge for subsequent elective liver transplantation under good clinical and hemodynamic conditions.

TI  - Characterisation of non-transferrin-bound iron (ferric citrate) uptake by rat hepatocytes in culture.  
AB  - Under conditions of iron overload plasma transferrin can be fully saturated and the plasma can transport non-transferrin-bound Fe which is rapidly cleared by the liver. Much of this Fe is complexed by citrate. The aim of the present work was to characterise the mechanisms by which Fe-citrate is taken up by hepatocytes using a rat hepatocyte cell culture model. The cells, after one day in culture, were incubated with 59Fe-labelled Fe-citrate for varying time periods, then washed and Fe uptake to the membrane and intracellular compartments of the cell was determined by radioactivity measurements. Maximal rates of internalisation of Fe occurred at a Fe:citrate molar ratio of 1:100 or greater, a pH of approximately 7.4 and an extracellular Ca2+ concentration of 1.0 mM. Fe uptake showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was a temperature-dependent process. The K(m) and Vmax for Fe internalisation by the cells at 37 degrees C were approximately 7 microM and 2 nmol/mg DNA/min (25 x 10(6) atoms/cell/min), respectively; and the Arrhenius activation energy was 35 kJ/mol. The transition metals, Zn2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, inhibited Fe uptake when used at 10 and 100 times the concentration of Fe. The rate of Fe internalisation from Fe-citrate was found to be approximately 20 times as great as that from Fe-transferrin with Fe concentrations of 1 and 2.5 microM for both forms of Fe. The rate of Fe uptake by iron-loaded hepatocytes obtained from rats which had been fed carbonyl Fe was not significantly different from that by normal hepatocytes. These experiments show that rat hepatocytes in primary culture have a high capacity to take up non-transferrin-bound Fe in the form of Fe-citrate and that uptake occurs by facilitated diffusion. The iron transport process does not appear to be regulated by cellular Fe levels.

TI  - Fast-FISH technique for rapid, simultaneous labeling of all human centromeres.  
AB  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a powerful tool in chromosome analysis. This report describes the systematic optimization of the Fast-FISH technique for centromere labeling of human metaphase chromosomes for radiobiological dosimetry purposes. For the present study, the hybridization conditions and the efficiency of two commercially available alpha-satellite DNA probes were compared ("human chromosome 1 specific", Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD, vs. "all-human chromosomes specific", Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany). These probes were hybridized to human lymphocyte metaphase plates by using a hybridization buffer without formamide and without any other equivalent denaturing chemical agents. The results indicate the suitability of the method for automated image analysis on the basis of thresholding. The optimal conditions concerning hybridization time and temperature were determined by a systematic quantitative evaluation of the fluorescent labeling sites after the hybridization procedures. Under defined "low stringency" conditions, we found that the "human chromosome 1 specific" DNA probe labeled not only the centromere of the human chromosome 1 but also the other human centromeres in the same way as the "all-human chromosome specific" DNA probe. The optimized conditions to complete all centromere labeling were applied to the detection of dicentric chromosomes on irradiated human lymphocyte samples (gamma-rays of 60Co source, 0.5 Gy/min, for doses of 1, 3, and 4 Gy). The yield of dicentrics was determined after Fast-FISH and compared with results obtained after Giemsa staining. These results are very compatible and indicate that, because of its simplicity, this optimized Fast-FISH procedure would be useful for fast screening purposes in biological dosimetry after accidental overexposure.

TI  - Tracer methods underestimate short-term variations in urea production in humans.  
AB  - Urea production rate (Ra) is commonly measured using a primed continuous tracer urea infusion, but the accuracy of this method has not been clearly established in humans. We used intravenous infusions of unlabeled urea to assess the accuracy of this technique in normal, postabsorptive men under the following four different conditions: 1) tracer [13C]urea was infused under basal conditions for 12 h (control); 2) tracer [13C]urea was infused for 12 h, and unlabeled urea was infused from hours 4 to 12 at a rate twofold greater than the endogenous Ra ("step" infusion); 3) tracer [13C]urea was infused for 12 h, and unlabeled urea was infused from hours 4 to 8 ("pulse" infusion); and 4) tracer [13C]urea was infused for 9 h, and unlabeled alanine was infused at a rate of 120 mg.kg-1.h-1 (1.35 mmol.kg-1.h-1) from hours 4 to 9. Urea Ra was calculated using the isotopic steady-state equation (tracer infusion rate/tracer-to-tracee ratio), Steele's non-steady-state equation, and urinary urea excretion corrected for changes in total body urea. For each subject, endogenous urea Ra was measured at hour 4 of the basal condition, and the sum of this rate plus exogenous urea input was considered as "true urea input". Under control conditions, urea Ra at hour 4 was similar to that measured at hour 12. After 8-h step and 4-h pulse unlabeled urea infusions, Steele's non-steady-state equation underestimated true urea input by 22% (step) and 33% (pulse), whereas the nonisotopic method underestimated true urea input by 28% (step) and 10% (pulse). Similar conclusions were derived from the alanine infusion. These results indicate that, although Steele's non-steady-state equation and the nontracer method more accurately predict total urea Ra than the steady-state equation, they nevertheless seriously underestimate total urea Ra for as long as 8 h after a change in true urea Ra.

TI  - Cellular distribution and kinetic properties of high-affinity glutamate transporters.  
AB  - L-glutamic acid is a key chemical transmitter of excitatory signals in the nervous system. The termination of glutamatergic transmission occurs via uptake of glutamate by a family of high-affinity glutamate transporters that utilize the Na+/K+ electrochemical gradient as a driving force. The stoichiometry of a single translocation cycle is still debatable, although all proposed models stipulate an inward movement of a net positive charge. This electrogenic mechanism is capable of translocating the neurotransmitter against its several thousand-fold concentration gradient, therefore, keeping the resting glutamate concentration below the treshold levels. The five cloned transporters (GLAST/EAAT1, GLT1/EAAT2, EAAC1/EAAT3, EAAT4, and EAAT5) exhibit distinct distribution patterns and kinetic properties in different brain regions, cell types, and reconstitution systems. Moreover, distinct pharmacological profiles were revealed among the species homologues. GLAST and GLT1, the predominant glutamate transporters in the brain, are coexpressed in astroglial processes, whereas neuronal carriers are mainly located in the dendrosomatic compartment. Some of these carrier proteins may possess signal transducing properties, distinct from their transporter activity.  Some experimental conditions and several naturally occurring and synthetic compounds are capable of regulating the expression of glutamate transporters. However, selective pharmacological tools interfering with the individual glutamate carriers have yet to be developed.

TI  - Clustering of slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors in human peripheral nerve and skin.  
AB  - The intrafascicular organization of human peripheral nerves was studied with percutaneous microneurography in the median, radial and peroneal nerves with one-surface or two-surface thin diameter concentric needle electrodes. Data from 33 recording sites containing 47 slowly adapting type II (SAII) units were analysed. At many sites two, sometimes even three, neighbouring SAII units were recorded from the explored nerve fascicle and they had adjacent or even overlapping cutaneous receptive fields. Among pairs of SAII units found at the same site, one unit often had ongoing discharge, whereas the other was silent under resting conditions. The neighbouring SAII units were optimally activated by stretching the skin in different directions. Stretching the same skin area in different directions produced different unit recruitment. Clustered SAII units were often found in sites where Pacinian afferents and skin sympathetic activity were also recorded. No significant difference was observed in the degree of grouping of SAII units either between recordings obtained with one-surface versus two-surface electrodes or between glabrous and hairy skin. The data do not support the notion that myelinated fibres are randomly organized in peripheral nerve fascicles. Instead, the findings suggest that SAII units tend to be clustered in human peripheral nerves. Furthermore, the response of groups of SAII units to skin stretch suggests that they play a role in proprioception. Dual channel recordings with two-surface concentric needle electrodes may provide a novel approach to study fibre organization in human peripheral nerves and the behaviour of groups of nerve fibres.

TI  - Zolpidem physical dependence assessed across increasing doses under a once-daily dosing regimen in baboons.  
AB  - The current study examined behavioral effects and possible development of physical dependence after once-daily doses of zolpidem (0, 1.0, 3.2, 10.0, 32.0 mg/kg intragastrically [i.g.]) in three baboons. Each dose was administered for 17 days and then the dose was increased; the 32.0 mg/kg dose was administered for 27 days. Baboons had access to food pellets for 20 hr/day beginning 15 min after dosing. Each day, baboons were presented with a fine motor task. Observation sessions were conducted 1 hr after dosing on days 1, 10, 12 and 14 of each dose condition and after termination of drug dosing. On days 10 and 14 of each dose condition, vehicle and flumazenil (5 mg/kg i.m.) were administered, respectively. Zolpidem increased the number of pellets obtained by two of three baboons. Vomit and/or retch and grimace (signs believed to be indicative of abdominal discomfort) were observed in one or two baboons during all zolpidem dose conditions (1.0-32.0 mg/kg). Time to complete the fine motor task increased dose-dependently in all three baboons, and incoordination was observed during the task in two baboons at 10.0 and 32.0 mg/kg. Analysis of blood plasma showed that measurable levels of zolpidem were present 24 hr after dosing in all drug conditions. The signs of flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal were summarized on a 9-point scale. Scores ranged from 1 to 5 in the 1.0 mg/kg condition, from 2 to 5 in the 3.2 and 10.0 mg/kg conditions and from 4 to 6 in the 32.0 mg/kg condition. Signs that were considered intermediate in severity were observed. Specifically, tremor, jerk and/or rigidly braced posture was observed in one baboon at 1.0 mg/kg, two baboons at the next two doses and all three baboons at 32.0 mg/kg. Vomit and/or retch also occurred in two baboons at dose conditions above 1.0 mg/kg. Discontinuation of zolpidem dosing after 78 to 79 days resulted in mild withdrawal signs (e.g., number of pellets obtained were lower and number of 1-min intervals increased in which eyes were closed, or in which lying down, head lower than torso posture and/or withdrawn posture were observed) on the first day in two baboons. The peak withdrawal scores were 4 or 5 on days 5 to 10; two baboons vomited and/or retched and all three baboons showed tremor, jerk and/or rigidly braced posture. Thus, zolpidem produced physical dependence under once-daily dosing conditions, and the severity of the withdrawal syndrome can be characterized as intermediate.

TI  - Class III beta-tubulin isotype (beta III) in the adrenal medulla: III. Differential expression of neuronal and glial antigens identifies two distinct populations of neuronal and glial-like (sustentacular) cells in the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line maintained in a Gelfoam matrix system.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line provides an established system for the study of neuronal differentiation. To our knowledge, glial differentiation has not been reported in this cell line. METHODS: We have studied, by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, the presence of neuronal cytoskeletal antigens [class III beta-tubulin isotype (beta III), microtubule associated proteins MAP2, MAP1B and tau, and different neurofilament (NF) protein components], and synaptophysin in comparison with the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 protein in the PC12 cell line. In three different experiments, PC12 cells were maintained in a three-dimensional gelatin foam (Gelfoam) matrix system for up to 34 days with and without treatment with 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic (dc)AMP. Immunohistochemistry was performed on explants ranging from 2 to 32 days-in vitro, which were fixed in either Bouin's solution, 70% ethanol, or 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Immunoblotting was performed on Gelfoam explants with a panel of antibodies against all aforementioned neuronal and glial markers. Additional immunoblot experiments using anti-GFAP and anti-beta III monoclonal antibodies in cell suspensions and homogenates from PC12 monolayer cultures were carried out to compare growth conditions in relation to the expression of these proteins. RESULTS: Beta III and MAP2 were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of PC12 explants maintained for up to 32 days in Gelfoam matrices with and without treatment with dcAMP. Intense filamentous and granular beta III staining of PC12 cells was observed in dcAMP-treated cultures concomitant with neuronal morphologic alterations (neuritogenesis and ganglionic phenotype). In untreated cultures, beta III staining was present in less differentiated cells, as well in cells undergoing neuritic development. The neuronal phenotype of PC12 cells was confirmed by staining for MAP2, tau, and NF proteins, as well as for synaptophysin. The presence of beta III, MAP2, MAP1B, tau, and NF proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting. Clusters of GFAP-positive and S-100 protein-positive spindle cells, phenotypically distinct from the chromaffin-like or neuronal cells, were demonstrated in Gelfoam explants at 5-30 days in vitro. In 30-day-old cultures treated with dcAMP, there was strong filamentous GFAP and diffuse S-100 protein staining in an increased number of sustentacular-like PC12 cells. GFAP staining was corroborated by immunoblotting of explants maintained under identical conditions in vitro. In contrast, immunoblots performed on homogenates from PC12 suspension and monolayer cultures were GFAP-negative. CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal and glial-like, presumed sustentacular, phenotypes were demonstrated in PC12 cells grown in Gelfoam matrices with and without treatment with dcAMP for up to 34 days. To our knowledge, the occurrence of glial differentiation in the PC12 line is a hitherto unreported finding. Adult rat medullary sustentacular cells are known to express S-100 and GFA proteins (Suzuki and Kachi, Kaibogaku Zasshi-Anat 70(2): 130-139, 1995), and the organ culture system employed in our study may well have favored this direction of differentiation.

TI  - Induced preference or conditioned aversion for sodium chloride in rats with chronic bile duct ligation.  
AB  - We examined whether a learned aversion to saline could account for the reduction in saline intake produced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats and whether increased saline intake by BDL rats was associated with hypotension. In three experiments, rats were given continuous access to water in choice with saline after surgery. In Experiment 1, rats were deprived of food and fluid for 24 h and then given 2-h access to either 0.15 or 0.3 M saline. Rats received a BDL or sham-ligation immediately (paired) or 48 h after (nonpaired) the 2-h bout of saline ingestion. The results show that nonpaired BDL rats increased their daily saline intake relative to nonpaired sham-ligated or paired BDL rats approximately 1-4 weeks after surgery. In Experiment 2, when water and either cherry or grape Kool-Aid (0.05% w/v) dissolved in 0.15 M saline to distinguish the flavor of the solution was offered prior to surgery, BDL rats reduced their ingestion of grape-flavored saline after surgery regardless of whether they were exposed to grape- or cherry-flavored saline prior to surgery. In Experiment 3, when rats were offered water and 0.3 M saline 48 h after surgery, BDL rats ligated for 4 weeks increased their saline intake relative to sham-ligated controls and this elevation in saline intake by BDL rats was associated with hypotension. The results suggest that the symptoms associated with the BDL surgery can serve as effective unconditioned stimuli in the acquisition of learned flavor aversions, and that hypotension may play a role in the elevated intake of saline by BDL rats.

TI  - A gel electrophoresis study of the competitive effects of monovalent counterion on the extent of divalent counterions binding to DNA.  
AB  - The behavior of alkaline earth metal cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and transition metal cations (Zn2+ and Cu2+) interacting with lambda-DNA-HindIII fragments ranging from 2,027 to 23,130 bp in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer solutions was investigated. The divalent counterions competed with Tris+ and Na+ for binding to polyion DNA, and the competition binding situations were investigated by measuring the reduction of the DNA mobility, by pulsed- or constant-field gel electrophoresis. The interaction of Mg2+ with DNA was intensively studied over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. In addition, we examined the competition binding as a function of ionic strength and DNA size. To compare valence effects, we studied Co(NH3)6(3+) interaction with DNA fragments under conditions similar to that of Mg2+. At relatively low Mg2+ concentration, the normalized titration curves of DNA mobility were well fit by Manning's two-variable counterion condensation (CC) theory. The agreement between the predicted value (total charge neutralization fraction theta) from Manning's CC theory and the data based on our measured DNA electrophoretic mobility reduction was consistent under our experimental conditions. In contrast to alkaline earth metal cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+), different binding behaviors were observed for the transition metal cations (Zn2+ and Cu2+). These differences highlight the usefulness of our reduced DNA electrophoretic mobility measurement approach to describing cation interactions with polyelectrolyte DNA.

TI  - Docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids are differently metabolized in rat liver during mitochondria and peroxisome proliferation.  
AB  - The 3-thia fatty acids, tetradecylthioacetic acid and 3,10-dithiadicarboxylic acid are mitochondrion and peroxisome proliferators. Administration of these promotes an increased transport of endogenous fatty acids to these organelles and a higher capacity of beta-oxidation. Administration of 3-thia fatty acids to rats resulted in a significant decrease of the hepatic level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (17-24%) and especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (40-80%) accompanied by increased gene expression of mitochondrial 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and enoyl-CoA isomerase. The mitochondrial oxidation of EPA was increased more than 4-fold after administration of 3-thia fatty acids. EPA-CoA was a good substrate for mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase-I and treatment with 3-thia fatty acids increased the activity 1.7-fold. DHA was a poor substrate for both mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation. DHA-CoA was a very poor substrate for mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase-I and -II, and the activity did not increase after treatment. However, the peroxisomal DHA-CoA oxidase increased 10-fold after 3-thia fatty acid treatment, whereas the peroxisomal EPA-CoA oxidase increased only 5-fold. In isolated hepatocytes, 16% of total metabolized EPA was oxidized and 76% was incorporated into glycerolipids, whereas DHA was oxidized very little. We conclude that under conditions of increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal proliferation by 3-thia fatty acids, a relatively higher oxidation rate of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids might result in a decreased hepatic level of EPA and DHA. Under these conditions DHA seems to be oxidized by the peroxisomes, whereas EPA, which can be oxidized in both organelles, is mainly oxidized by mitochondria.

TI  - Mechanisms underlying the effects of unsignaled delayed reinforcement on key pecking of pigeons under variable-interval schedules.  
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to test an interpretation of the response-rate-reducing effects of unsignaled nonresetting delays to reinforcement in pigeons. According to this interpretation, rates of key pecking decrease under these conditions because key pecks alternate with hopper-observing behavior. In Experiment 1, 4 pigeons pecked a food key that raised the hopper provided that pecks on a different variable-interval-schedule key met the requirements of a variable-interval 60-s schedule. The stimuli associated with the availability of the hopper (i.e., houselight and keylight off, food key illuminated, feedback following food-key pecks) were gradually removed across phases while the dependent relation between hopper availability and variable-interval-schedule key pecks was maintained. Rates of pecking the variable-interval-schedule key decreased to low levels and rates of food-key pecks increased when variable-interval-schedule key pecks did not produce hopper-correlated stimuli. In Experiment 2, pigeons initially pecked a single key under a variable-interval 60-s schedule. Then the dependent relation between hopper presentation and key pecks was eliminated by arranging a variable-time 60-s schedule. When rates of pecking had decreased to low levels, conditions were changed so that pecks during the final 5 s of each interval changed the keylight color from green to amber. When pecking produced these hopper-correlated stimuli, pecking occurred at high rates, despite the absence of a peck-food dependency. When peck-produced changes in keylight color were uncorrelated with food, rates of pecking fell to low levels. In Experiment 3, details (obtained delays, interresponse-time distributions, eating times) of the transition from high to low response rates produced by the introduction of a 3-s unsignaled delay were tracked from session to session in 3 pigeons that had been initially trained to peck under a conventional variable-interval 60-s schedule. Decreases in response rates soon after the transition to delayed reinforcement were accompanied by decreases in eating times and alterations in interresponse-time distributions. As response rates decreased and became stable, eating times increased and their variability decreased. These findings support an interpretation of the effects of delayed reinforcement that emphasizes the importance of hopper-observing behavior.

TI  - Benzodiazepine use and motor vehicle accidents. Systematic review of reported association [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between benzodiazepine (BZD) use and motor vehicle accidents (MVAs). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched from 1980 to 1997 using the key words traffic accidents or motor vehicle accidents and benzodiazepines (and alternative terms and outcomes) in English, German, French, or Italian. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies of BZDs and MVAs; police or emergency studies of BZD use among travelers; driving tests with subjects taking BZDs. Outcomes were impaired driving, accidents; mortality; postaccident medical attention, emergency ward care, or hospitalization. Quality criteria were whether all driving BZD users and non-users had an equal chance of entering the study; whether medication dosage and timing were ascertained; whether all kilometres driven by BZD users and non-users were studied; whether all types of accidents were ascertained; and whether medical conditions were controlled for. SYNTHESIS: In case-control studies, the odds ratios for mortality and emergency medical treatment ranged from 1.45 to 2.4 in relation to time of use and quantity of drug taken. In police and emergency ward studies, BZD use was a factor in 1% to 65% of accidents (usually 5% to 10%). In two studies where subjects had blood alcohol concentrations less than the legal limit, BZDs were found in 43% and 65% of subjects. In one study with controls, 5% of drivers and 2% of controls in accidents had used BZDs. CONCLUSIONS: Case-control studies suggest using BZDs approximately doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The risk for drivers older than 65 of being involved in reported motor vehicle collisions is higher when they take longer-acting and larger quantities of BZDs.

TI  - Influence of FIS on the transcription from closely spaced and non-overlapping divergent promoters for an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase gene (gltX) and a tRNA operon (valU) in Escherichia coli.  
AB  - The gltX gene, encoding the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), and the valU operon, whose transcripts contain three tRNAVal/UAC and one tRNALys/UUU, are adjacent and divergently transcribed. It is the only known case of adjacent genes encoding an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and a tRNA precursor in Escherichia coli. The gltX promoters (P1, P2 and P3) direct the synthesis of transcripts non-overlapping with and divergent from the one initiated at the valU promoter. We report that their promoter region (250 bp) contains three binding sites for the factor for inversion stimulation (FIS), centred at positions -71, -91 and -112 from the valU transcription initiation site, and that the destruction of any of these sites does not prevent the binding of FIS to the others. As FIS is one of the major positive regulators of stable RNA operons, we have studied its role on gltX and valU transcription. FIS stimulates valU transcription in vitro and about twofold in vivo during steady-state exponential growth. In contrast, gltX transcription is repressed by the presence of FIS in vitro and about twofold in vivo during growth acceleration when a decrease in GluRS concentration was observed.  Under all conditions tested, most of the gltX transcripts start at the P3 promoter. Nested deletions of this regulatory region reveal that the FIS-dependent repression of the gltX-P3 promoter is abolished after the removal of the valU promoter, and is not altered by the additional removal of the FIS binding sites; moreover, in vivo transcription from gltX-P1 and/or gltX-P2 present on some of these regulatory region variants is modulated by the nature of the upstream region by FIS and is sometimes stronger than that from gltX-P3. These results show that the strength and the site of gltX transcription initiation are influenced by the upstream region up to and including the valU promoter; furthermore, they indicate that although these adjacent genes are involved in the first step of protein biosynthesis and share cis and trans regulatory elements, their transcription is non-co-ordinate.

TI  - Fatal air embolism in an airplane passenger with a giant intrapulmonary bronchogenic cyst.  
AB  - Considering the large number of airplane passengers with a variety of medical conditions, the incidence of in-flight emergencies on commercial airline flights is low. Only few cases of pulmonary barotrauma in airplane passengers with prior lung pathologies have been reported. We present the unusual case of a female airplane passenger with a previously diagnosed asymptomatic giant intrapulmonary bronchogenic cyst who experienced fatal air embolism on a commercial airline flight. We believe that preventive surgical resection is mandatory in asymptomatic patients with large intrapulmonary cysts prior to exposure to even small alterations in ambient pressure as, for instance, prior to airplane flight or use of mountain cable cars. However, screening for pre-existent lung pathologies in the growing mass of commercial airline travelers is not justified.

TI  - A simple and early prognostic index for acute renal failure patients requiring renal replacement therapy.  
AB  - Recent advances in technology have not substantially changed the high mortality rate associated with acute renal failure (ARF). To obtain a simple, valid prognostic index, we retrospectively evaluated the relative importance of demographic data, causes (acute insults) of renal failure, and comorbid clinical conditions for the outcome in 102 ARF patients who received renal replacement therapy with an overall mortality rate of 65% (66 of 102). There were no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in age and gender. Mortality according to acute insults was similar to that of the whole population studied.  Of the 10 clinical conditions at the time of the first renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0002), cardiac failure (p = 0.0006), hepatic failure (p = 0.003), central nervous system dysfunction (p = 0.005), and oliguria (p = 0.04) were found to be significantly related to mortality by univariate analysis. Furthermore, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only mechanical ventilation, cardiac failure, and hepatic failure were significant risk factors. Survival was directly related to the number of significant variables in univariate analysis: zero, 89% (8 of 9); one, 62% (21 of 34); two, 19% (5 of 27); three, 10% (2 of 20); four, 0% (0 of 8); five, 0% (0 of 4). This simple and early prognostic index, derived from the assessment of clinical conditions which were easily determined at the patient's bedside, could be useful for outcome prediction in ARF patients requiring renal replacement therapy.

TI  - Unexpected homology between inducible cell wall protein QID74 of filamentous fungi and BR3 salivary protein of the insect Chironomus.  
AB  - A gene, qid74, of mycoparasitic filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum and its allies encodes a cell wall protein that is induced by replacing glucose in the culture medium with chitin (simulated mycoparasitism conditions). Because no trace of this gene can be detected in related species such as Gibberella fujikuroi and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the qid74 gene appears to have arisen de novo within the genus Trichoderma. Qid74 protein, 687 residues long, is now seen as highly conserved tandem repeats of the 59-residue-long unit. This unit itself, however, may have arisen as tandem repeats of the shorter 13-residue-long basic unit. Within the genus Trichoderma, the amino acid sequence of Qid74 proteins has been conserved in toto. The most striking is the fact that Qid74 shares 25.3% sequence identity with the carboxyl-terminal half of the 1,572-residue-long BR3 protein of the dipteran insect Chironomus tentans. BR3 protein is secreted by the salivary gland of each aquatic larva of Chironomus to form a tube to house itself. Furthermore, the consensus sequence derived from these 59-residue-long repeating units resembles those of epidermal growth factor-like domains found in divergent invertebrate and vertebrate proteins as to the positions of critical cysteine residues and homology of residues surrounding these cysteines.

AB  - A national population based study of the health of Irish travellers has been carried out. The prevalence of congenital anomalies in this population has been compared to the general population in the Eastern Health Board region. The prevalence of congenital anomalies in travellers was 5.5%, compared to 2.9% in the Eastern Health region, an odds ratio of 1.95.  When metabolic conditions were excluded there were no significant difference. There was a trend, not reaching statistical significance, for the prevalence of congenital anomalies among travellers to be greater in offsprings of first cousin marriages (6.5%) then in those born to unrelated parents (3.8%), on odds ratio of 1.73. A balance needs to be sought between being sensitive to cultural reasons for consanguinity and giving information to communities about the negative health consequences of certain cultural practices.

TI  - Use of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of men with high sperm chromatin stability.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether improvements of the seminal vesicle function after a 5-day course with clomiphene citrate (CC) may reduce the prevalence of men with high sperm chromatin stability under conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: Andrology laboratory at the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Altura, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru. PATIENT(S): Forty-one male partners of infertile couples attending the andrology laboratory. INTERVENTION(S): Clomiphene citrate was administered orally twice a day. Men were treated with CC at 100 mg daily for 5 days. Blood and semen samples were collected before treatment and 24 hours after the last administration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum testosterone, seminal fructose, sperm motility, sperm chromatin stability after SDS and EDTA, and prevalence of high sperm chromatin stability. RESULT(S): The percentage of stable sperm after SDS-EDTA correlated inversely with the basal corrected concentration of seminal fructose (-1.77 +/- 0.89, beta +/- SE). High sperm chromatin stability was observed in 53.8% of the study population and in 66.7% of patients with hypofunction of the seminal vesicles. In those men whose seminal vesicle function improved after treatment with CC, the prevalence of high sperm chromatin stability was reduced from 67% to 25% (chi2 = 5.34). Logistic regression analysis showed that the higher the basal corrected seminal fructose levels and the higher the basal serum testosterone levels, the lower the probability of nonresponse of the sperm chromatin stability to treatment with CC (0.54 +/- 0.15, odds ratio +/- SE for corrected fructose; and 0.50 +/- 0.15, odds ratio +/- SE for serum testosterone). CONCLUSION(S): Hypofunction of the seminal vesicles was associated with high sperm chromatin stability, and this high sperm chromatin stability under SDS-EDTA conditions may be reduced by treatment with CC.

TI  - The three-dimensional structure of the nitrogen regulatory protein IIANtr from Escherichia coli.  
AB  - The bacterial rpoN operon codes for sigma 54, which is the key sigma factor that, under nitrogen starvation conditions, activates the transcription of genes needed to assimilate ammonia and glutamate. The rpoN operon contains several other open reading frames that are cotranscribed with sigma 54. The product of one of these, the 17.9 kDa protein IIANtr, is homologous to IIA proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase (PTS) system. IIANtr influences the transcription of sigma 54-dependent genes through an unknown mechanism and may thereby provide a regulatory link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Here we describe the 2.35 A X-ray structure of Escherichia coli IIANtr. It is the first structure of a IIA enzyme from the fructose-mannitol family of the PTS. The enzyme displays a novel fold characterized by a central mixed parallel/anti-parallel beta-sheet surrounded by six alpha-helices. The active site His73 is situated in a shallow depression on the protein surface.

TI  - Occupation, asthma, and chronic respiratory symptoms in a community sample of older women.  
AB  - We evaluated the role of occupational factors on the prevalence of self-reported asthma, chronic bronchitis, and asthma-like respiratory symptoms among women >= 55 yr. Occupational history, smoking, and respiratory conditions were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire from 1,226 women. Lung function data from 820 subjects were used for group "validation" of the outcome variables. Significant associations were observed between the respiratory conditions and occupational groupings based on the longest occupation held. Artists, writers, decorators, and photographers (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1), and women in service occupations (OR = 2.4) had a significantly increased risk of asthma. The odds of asthma-like symptoms was significantly elevated among nurses and other nonphysician health workers (OR = 2.9), social workers (OR = 2.9), and homemakers (OR = 2.4). Exposure to dusts, gas, vapors, fumes, or sensitizers was associated with a significantly increased odds of asthma (OR = 1.8) and with a marginally significant increased odds of asthma-like symptoms (OR = 1.4). Smoking accounted for a large proportion of asthma and asthma-like conditions in this population (population attributable risk [PAR] = 40.5% and 35.0%, respectively); employment in occupations with a high probability of exposures to dusts, gas, vapors, fumes, or sensitizers also contributed significantly to the burden of asthma (PAR = 15.1 to 20.0%) and asthma-like symptoms (PAR = 7.5 to 10.2%).

TI  - The operative management of a malignant proximal humerus tumor represented by secondary Paget's osteosarcoma.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Malignant tumors at the proximal humerus are an operative challenge. Radical removal is a principal of tumor surgery but as much functionality as possible should be retained. These conditions often conflict so a compromise has to be reached. This paper proposes a solution to this dilemma, introducing an operative approach, with a new modular prosthesis, to a secondary Paget's osteosarcoma in the proximal humerus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A recently developed humerus modular prosthesis is described, which has been implanted into a patient with Paget's osteosarcoma. In these, mostly elderly, patients, successful operative therapy should combine radical removal with early mobilization. Paget's osteosarcoma is a recognized complication of the disease, and its prognosis is poor. In our patient, the implanted humerus prosthesis allowed a limb-saving procedure to be combined with radical removal of the tumor and postoperative early mobilization. A 3-month follow-up yielded good results with no recurrence of the disease and the patient had satisfactory movement. She was able to resume normal daily life shortly after the operation. CONCLUSION: Implantation of a modular prosthesis of the humerus may allow radical removal of a malignant tumor in that area while achieving early motion. In the literature, amputation is often advocated, as radical treatment with chemotherapy is not a successful option in this elderly patient group. We think the alternative use of a modular prosthesis of the humerus is possible in selected cases. We have encountered no other case in the literature where a limb-saving procedure attempts to preserve as much functionality as possible in Paget's osteosarcoma.

TI  - Comorbidity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with psychiatric disorder: an overview.  
AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been noted to be comorbid with a variety of psychiatric disorders. These include oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, as well as affective, anxiety, and learning disorders. Considerable debate has revolved as to the meaning of this overlap. Does it occur by chance or is it an artifact of referral bias? Are the comorbid conditions secondary to the ADHD, or can other psychiatric disorders masquerade as attentional problems? Alternatively, ADHD may exist as distinct subtypes, each with its specific comorbidity. Studies that have examined the comorbidity of oppositional, conduct, affective, anxiety, and learning disorders in ADHD are reviewed. ADHD and ADHD with conduct disorder appear to be distinct subtypes, possibly with different etiologies. While the short-term response to stimulants is the same in these two groups, children with ADHD and conduct disorder children have higher rates of antisocial personality as adults. Coexisting anxiety appears to attenuate impulsivity in ADHD, and stimulant response is poorer in ADHD children with comorbid anxiety. Anxiety and ADHD appear to be inherited independently. A subset of ADHD children also meet criteria for bipolar disorder, although the exact prevalence of this diagnosis in ADHD children is strongly debated. Regardless of prevalence, this is a severely impaired group of ADHD children, with high rates of aggression and psychiatric disorder in their families. The comorbidity of ADHD and major depression is much less studied, and few firm conclusions can be made about it. Finally, about 20%-25% of ADHD children meet criteria for a learning disorder, but learning disorders appear to be independent of ADHD.

TI  - Survival and function of hepatocytes on a novel three-dimensional synthetic biodegradable polymer scaffold with an intrinsic network of channels[see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the survival and function of hepatocytes (HCs) on a novel three-dimensional (3D) synthetic biodegradable polymer scaffold with an intrinsic network of interconnected channels under continuous flow conditions. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The authors' laboratory has investigated HC transplantation using 3D biodegradable polymers as scaffolding as an alternative approach to treatment of end-stage liver disease. Previous studies have demonstrated survival of HCs transplanted on polymer discs in peripheral tissue sites and partial correction of single enzyme liver defects. One of the major limitations has been the insufficient survival of an adequate mass of transplanted cells; this is thought to be caused by inadequate oxygen diffusion. METHODS: HCs and nonparenchymal liver cells from Lewis rats were seeded onto 3D biodegradable polymer scaffolds. Microporous 3D polymers were created using 3D printing on copolymers of polylactide-coglycolide. The cell/polymer constructs were placed in static culture or continuous flow conditions. The devices were retrieved after 2 days and examined by scanning electron microscopy and histology. Culture medium was analyzed for albumin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Differences in culture parameters including pH, PCO2, PO2, glucose, lactate, and HCO3 were examined. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy revealed successful attachment of HCs on the 3D polymer in both static and flow conditions. Histology demonstrated viable HCs in both conditions. ELISA demonstrated a significantly higher mean concentration of albumin in flow conditions than in static conditions. Culture parameter analysis revealed a significantly higher PO2 and glucose level, and a more physiologic pH in flow conditions than in static conditions. CONCLUSIONS: HCs cocultured with nonparenchymal cells can attach to and survive on the 3D polymer scaffolds in both static and flow conditions in the size and configuration used in this study. Flow conditions may provide a more conducive environment for HC metabolism and albumin synthesis than static conditions. The authors hypothesize that flow through directed channels will be necessary for the transfer of large masses of cells when implantation studies are initiated.

TI  - Release of dopamine and norepinephrine by hypoxia from PC-12 cells.  
AB  - We examined the effects of hypoxia on the release of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) from rat pheochromocytoma 12 (PC-12) cells and assessed the involvement of Ca2+ and protein kinases in stimulus-secretion coupling. Catecholamine release was monitored by microvoltammetry using a carbon fiber electrode as well as by HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection (ECD). Microvoltammetric analysis showed that hypoxia-induced catecholamine secretion (PO2 of medium approximately 40 mmHg) occurred within 1 min after the onset of the stimulus and reached a plateau between 10 and 15 min. HPLC-ECD analysis revealed that, at any level of PO2, the release of NE was greater than the release of DA. In contrast, in response to K+ (80 mM), DA release was approximately 11-fold greater than NE release. The magnitude of hypoxia-induced NE and DA releases depended on the passage, source, and culture conditions of the PC-12 cells. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers attenuated hypoxia-induced release of both DA and NE to a similar extent. Protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine (200 nM) and bisindolylmaleimide I (2 microM), on the other hand, attenuated hypoxia-induced NE release more than DA release. However, protein kinase inhibitors had no significant effect on K+-induced NE and DA releases. These results demonstrate that hypoxia releases catecholamines from PC-12 cells and that, for a given change in PO2, NE release is greater than DA release. It is suggested that protein kinases are involved in the enhanced release of NE during hypoxia.

TI  - Variability of bothrojaracin isoforms and other venom principles in individual jararaca (Bothrops jararaca) snakes maintained under seasonally invariant conditions.  
AB  - Bothrojaracin (BJC) is a potent thrombin inhibitor isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca. Venoms from individual snakes have been shown to vary in BJC content, and more than one molecular variant (isoform) has been identified in the same venom. In order to determine whether the production of this protein and its isoforms varies under seasonally invariant conditions, an analysis was made of BJC isolated from venoms collected individually once a month for 10 months from two female B. jararaca snakes kept under conditions of constant temperature and photoperiod. The crude venom from each individual snake exhibited a characteristic pattern of protein bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with no noticeable variation throughout the collecting period. BJC from individual venoms was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 followed by an affinity column (PPACK-thrombin Sepharose). BJC content and other activities such as phospholipase A2, azocaseinolytic activity and inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation varied considerably among the samples. Purified BJC from both snakes inhibited fibrin coagulation and migrated as a single band of 27,000 mol. wt on SDS-PAGE. However, the BJC pattern on non-denaturing PAGE differed between the two snakes, with four to six bands per sample each month, which were all recognized by polyclonal anti-BJC antibodies. The isoelectric focusing pattern of BJC was also characteristic for each snake, with only minor differences throughout the collecting period. These results indicate that under seasonally invariant conditions: (1) there was a considerable variation over the 10-month period in the production of BJC and other important venom activities such as phospholipase A2 and proteinases; (2) individual B. jararaca snakes produced a distinctive array of BJC isoforms; and (3) despite quantitative differences, there were essentially no qualitative differences in the production of BJC isoforms by individual snakes during the 10-month period.

TI  - Regulation of HSF1 activation and Hsp expression in mouse tissues under physiological stress conditions.  
AB  - The studies described above illustrate several important points concerning the study of the cellular stress response. First, they indicate that there are important differences between the nature of the stress response observed in tumor cell lines and that of primary cells of mouse tissues. Therefore, caution should be exercised to avoid overextending and overinterpreting the results of studies using these cell lines until evidence can be obtained from in vivo studies on intact animals or primary cells of tissues. Second, they reveal the existence of cell-type-dependent differences between cell types of the same organism, thus potentially calling into question the supposed universal cytoprotective nature of the cellular stress response. Future studies can address this question by determining the underlying mechanisms that regulate these cell-type-dependent differences in the stress response, and by determining whether there are biological reasons that some cell types exhibit differences in either the temperature set-point or magnitude of the stress response.

TI  - Quantification of sphingosine derivatives in human platelets: inducible formation of free sphingosine.  
AB  - To elucidate the physiologic role of sphingolipid-derived products as signaling molecules, we analyzed the levels of endogenous sphingosine (Sph) derivatives in human platelets. When the platelets were stimulated with thrombin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, neither ceramide formation nor sphingomyelin hydrolysis was observed, which suggests that the sphingomyelin cycle may not be an essential part of the signaling pathway under these conditions. In contrast, Sph was found to increase in platelets upon stimulation. The level of Sph 1-phosphate, which is formed from Sph by the action of Sph kinase, was not affected under our conditions. Although it has been established that Sph inhibits protein kinase C, which regulates the functional responses of the platelets, Sph levels which exert an inhibitory effect on protein kinase C cannot be attained under physiological conditions (without exogenous Sph). Considering the stimulation of the synthesis of Sph by the physiological agonist thrombin, we speculate that Sph is a signaling molecule of physiological importance in platelets, but protein kinase C may not be its target.

AB  - We retrospectively reviewed hip arthroplasties in 13 patients (15 hips), in whom we had used apatite-wollastonite (A-W) glass ceramic together with auto- or allograft for augmentation of severe bone deficiency. 11 cemented sockets and 4 stem revisions were included and followed for 2-9.6 years. There were no radiolucent lines between A-W glass ceramic and surrounding bone, and remodeling of the bone graft containing A-W glass ceramic was observed. No migration of cemented sockets was seen except in 1 case, which was revised. In this case, direct bonding between bone and A-W glass ceramic granules was present histologically. In 4 stem revisions, 5 mm subsidence occurred in 1 case. However, the stem became stable and remodeling of the grafted bone occurred. An artificial bone material, such as A-W glass ceramic, can be used under high-load conditions, because of its good mechanical properties.

TI  - Decrease of dielectric constant transforms the protein molecule into the molten globule state.  
AB  - The effect of organic solvents of different nature (alcohols, amides, and cyclic ethers) on the structural properties of beta-lactoglobulin was studied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the protein molecule undergoes at least two consecutive conformational transitions upon increase of the organic solvent concentration. Denaturation of the protein molecule occurs in the first step and a transition into the highly helical non-compact state in the second. In other words, under such conditions a compact denatured intermediate state is formed with a pronounced secondary structure, i.e., a molten globule-like state. It is shown that decrease of the dielectric constant of the media is responsible for structural changes of the protein molecule.

TI  - Hot water swallows improve symptoms and accelerate esophageal clearance in esophageal motility disorders.  
AB  - Cold liquid ingestion may precipitate episodes of dysphagia and chest pain in patients with spastic esophageal motility disorders. The effect of hot liquids on esophageal symptoms, esophageal peristalsis, and clearance and any potential therapeutic benefit in such patients has not been examined. Using esophageal scintigraphy and manometry, we have investigated the effects of hot water swallows on dysphagia, chest pain, and esophageal motility and clearance in patients with esophageal motility disorders. We studied 48 men and women with intermittent dysphagia to both solids and liquids, chest pain, and/or regurgitation. All patients underwent upper endoscopy, barium swallow, and esophageal manometry using standard techniques. Esophageal scintigraphy assessed esophageal transit time (ETT) and retrograde intraesophageal movement of bolus at baseline (22 degrees C) and after hot (60 degrees C) water swallows. Esophageal manometry assessed the amplitude and duration of esophageal contractions in response to baseline and hot water swallows. Patients were followed clinically for as long as 6 months to assess symptomatic response. We found that baseline esophageal scintigraphy revealed a mean ETT of 48.5 seconds; after hot water swallow, mean ETT was 27.8 seconds (p < 0.001). The number of secondary peaks at baseline was 3.5; after hot water swallow, it was 2.1 (p < 0.001). Baseline esophageal manometry showed a mean esophageal body contraction amplitude of 188 mm Hg (mean duration, 11.8 seconds) in response to wet swallows and 125 mm Hg (mean duration, 5.7 seconds) with hot water swallows (p < 0.001). Clinically, 28 (58%) of 48 patients noted significant (>50%) improvement of their symptoms and have been ingesting hot water or other hot liquids regularly with their meals. We conclude that hot water accelerates esophageal clearance, decreases the amplitude and duration of esophageal body contractions, and improves symptoms in patients with esophageal motility disorders. Because of its safety and simplicity, it may have an important role in the management of these chronic conditions.

TI  - TGGA repeats impair nucleosome formation.  
AB  - Nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, are responsible for DNA packaging in eukaryotic cell nuclei. They play a structural role in genome condensation, and influence transcription and replication. Properties of the DNA sequence, such as curvature and flexibility, direct the location of nucleosomes. DNA sequences that position nucleosomes have been identified and rules that govern their properties have been formulated. However, DNA sequences that are refractory to nucleosome formation have been less well characterised and it is possible that they may perturb or alter chromatin structure. Here we identify such sequences by selecting those that refrain from nucleosome formation from a large pool of synthetic DNA fragments with a central region of 146 random base-pairs fitted with adapters for PCR amplification. These were used for in vitro salt-induced reconstitution of nucleosomes under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Fragments that did not form nucleosomes were purified, amplified by PCR, and the reconstitution was repeated. After 17 rounds of negative selection, the material was highly enriched in sequences reluctant to form nucleosomes. Cloning and sequencing revealed that 35% of the molecules had long repeats of TGGA, and their affinity for histone octamers was about half that of average DNA. Copyright 1998 Academic Press

AB  - The literature on uroflowmetry in women is presented and evaluated. Uroflowmeters are described and found generally sufficiently accurate, although the errors arising from electronic evaluation may invalidate the test. Six flow curve patterns are proposed in accordance with described pathological conditions. From the literature it is summarized that the normal Qmax is 20-36 ml/s. Qmax is linearly correlated to the voided volume, increasing by 5.6 ml/s/100 ml. Pregnancy, age and menstrual cycle do not influence Qmax. Several pathological conditions have been associated with specific flow curve patterns. These conditions are described and associations with the proposed flow definitions made.

TI  -  Microaerophilic conditions promote growth of Mycobacterium genavense.  
AB  - Our studies show that microaerophilic conditions promote the growth of Mycobacterium genavense in semisolid medium. The growth of M. genavense at 2.5 or 5% oxygen was superior to that obtained at 21% oxygen in BACTEC primary cultures (Middlebrook 7H12, pH 6.0, without additives). By using nondecontaminated specimens, it was possible to detect growth with very small inocula (25 bacilli/ml) of 12 different M. genavense strains (from nude mice) within 6 weeks of incubation under low oxygen tension; conversely, with 21% oxygen, no growth of 8 of 12 (66.7%) M. genavense strains was detected (growth index, <10). The same beneficial effect of 2.5 or 5% oxygen was observed in primary cultures of a decontaminated clinical specimen. Low oxygen tension (2.5 or 5%) is recommended for the primary isolation of M. genavense. Microaerophilic cultivation of other atypical mycobacteria, especially slow-growing (e.g., Mycobacterium avium) and difficult-to-grow (e.g., Mycobacterium ulcerans) species, is discussed.

TI  - Accuracy characteristics of throwing as a result of maximum force effort.  
AB  - Fitts' law predicts the accuracy of movement to a target decreases as the velocity of the movement increases. This speed-accuracy tradeoff has been examined under numerous conditions. During some tasks, however, increased force to nearly maximal level decreases the variability of the movement (Sherwood & Schmidt, 1980). This condition apparently produced results different from what would be predicted by Fitts' law. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of maximal force on dart throwing accuracy and variability. 54 subject were categorized into groups based upon their experience with dart throwing: Advanced, Intermediate, or Beginners. Each subject performed two sessions of 15 trials. Subjects were instructed to "throw normally" for one session and "throw as hard as you can" for the other session Distances from the target (triple-20 area) on the regulation dart board were measured and recorded after each of three darts was thrown. Average Error and Variable Error were calculated for each condition for each subject. The Average Error and Variable Error were greatest for the Beginner group and least for the Advanced group. For all three experience categories both Average Error and Variable Error were significantly greater when subjects performed with maximal force. The greater average error for the maximal force for all subjects suggested that the speed-accuracy tradeoff applied to this aiming task. The greater variability in accuracy with maximal force suggested a ceiling effect, which reduced variability in previous studies, was not achieved.

TI  - Mass spectrometric evidence that agents that cause loss of Ca2+ from intracellular compartments induce hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from pancreatic islet membrane phospholipids by a mechanism that does not require a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.  
AB  - Stimulation of pancreatic islets with glucose induces phospholipid hydrolysis and accumulation of nonesterified arachidonic acid, which may amplify the glucose-induced Ca2+ entry into islet beta-cells that triggers insulin secretion. Ca2+ loss from beta-cell intracellular compartments has been proposed to induce both Ca2+ entry and events dependent on arachidonate metabolism. We examine here effects of inducing Ca2+ loss from intracellular sequestration sites with ionophore A23187 and thapsigargin on arachidonate hydrolysis from islet phospholipids. A23187 induces a decline in islet arachidonate-containing phospholipids and release of nonesterified arachidonate. A23187-induced arachidonate release is of similar magnitude when islets are stimulated in Ca2+-replete or in Ca2+-free media or when islets loaded with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA are stimulated in Ca2+-free medium, a condition in which A23187 induces no rise in beta-cell cytosolic [Ca2+]. Thapsigargin also induces islet arachidonate release under these conditions. A23187- or thapsigargin-induced arachidonate release is prevented by a bromoenol lactone (BEL) inhibitor of a beta-cell phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), which does not require Ca2+ for catalytic activity and which is negatively modulated by and physically interacts with calmodulin by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Agents that cause Ca2+ loss from islet intracellular compartments thus induce arachidonate hydrolysis from phospholipids by a BEL-sensitive mechanism that does not require a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], and a BEL-sensitive enzyme-like iPLA2 or a related membranous activity may participate in sensing Ca2+ compartment content.

TI  - Measurement of nephron filtration from distal and proximal tubules.  
AB  - Nephron filtration rate (SNGFR), measured proximally by micropuncture using the technique of total collection of tubular fluid, may be spuriously high as the fall in intratubular pressure during collection may increase the net filtration pressure. Alternatively, the interrupted distal delivery of tubular fluid during proximal collection may up-regulate SNGFR by activating the tubulo-glomerular feedback. The accuracy of nephron filtration measurements was tested in 65 rats, by sampling from the distal and then from the proximal tubule of the same nephrons. Collections were also made in the presence of high concentrations of furosemide at the dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. In 290 nephrons, distal SNGFR was not significantly different from the paired measurements obtained from the proximal tubule (39+/-1 vs 39+/-1 nl/min, p > 0.83). During furosemide, the paired data were 42+/-2 vs 41+/-2 nl/min, p > 0.82, n=92. Different hydration conditions did not influence the results. The correlation between distally and proximally measured filtration rates held for the whole range of measurements (R=0.56; p < 0.0001).  Under the present experimental conditions, SNGFR is not spuriously high when measured by total blockade of the proximal tubule. The accuracy of measurements and their reproducibility is not influenced by the site of sampling.

TI  - The comorbidity of alcoholism with anxiety and depressive disorders in four geographic communities.  
AB  - The comorbidity of alcoholism with anxiety and depressive disorders was examined in four epidemiologic investigations from diverse geographic sites. Despite variability in lifetime prevalence rates for these disorders, there was strong cross-site consistency in the magnitude and specific patterns of comorbidity. Individuals with alcohol abuse or dependence generally experienced a twofold to threefold increased risk of anxiety and depressive disorders.  Phobic conditions typically preceded the onset of alcoholism, but no systematic pattern was observed for panic or depressive disorders. Considerable heterogeneity was also observed concerning the impact of comorbid conditions on symptoms of the index disorder. While the presence of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders was consistently associated with moderate increases in the symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence, alcoholism was associated with large increases in the number of depressive symptoms and little or no increase in phobic symptoms. The findings are discussed in terms of the self-medication hypothesis and the etiologic heterogeneity of these forms of comorbidity in the general population.

TI  - Vital statistics of Panstronglus geniculatus (Latreille 1811) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) under experimental conditions.  
AB  - A statistical evaluation of the population dynamics of Panstrongylus geniculatus is based on a cohort experiment conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Animals were fed on hen every 15 days. Egg incubation took 21 days; mean duration of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar nymphs was 25, 30, 58, 62, and 67 days, respectively; mean nymphal development time was 39 weeks and adult longevity was 72 weeks. Females reproduced during 30 weeks, producing an average of 61.6 eggs for female on its lifetime; the average number of eggs/female/week was 2.1. Total number of eggs produced by the cohort was 1379. Average hatch for the cohort was 88.9%; it was not affected by age of the mother. Age specific survival and reproduction tables were constructed. The following population parameters were evaluated, generation time was 36.1 weeks; net reproduction rate was 89.4; intrinsic rate of natural increase was 0.125; instantaneous birth and death rates were 0.163 and 0.039 respectively; finite rate of increase 1.13; total reproductive value was 1196 and stable age distribution was 31.2% eggs, 64.7% nymphs and 4.1% adults. Finally the population characteristics of P. geniculatus lead to the conclusion that this species is a K strategist.

It often presents with a rapid onset of muscle bleeding and involves the IgG antibody. It may be treated with human or porcine factor VIII (FVIII), prothrombin complex concentrates, factor IX (FIX) complex concentrates, factor VIIa (FVIIa) or by immunosuppression. We report a case of acquired haemophilia in a 40-year-old woman diagnosed following laparotomy. She was treated unsuccessfully using human FVIII and cryoprecipitate, porcine FVIII and FIX complex concentrate, before being treated with recombinant FVIIa (NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk). On treatment with recombinant FVIIa, bleeding stopped rapidly with no side-effects and the abdominal haematoma was evacuated with minimal post-operative bleeding.

TI  - Determination of airway and tissue resistances after antigen and methacholine in nonhuman primates.  
AB  - Antigen challenge of Ascaris suum-sensitive animals has been used as a model of asthma in humans. However, no reports have separated total respiratory resistance into airway (Raw) and tissue (Rti) components. We compared input impedance (Zin) and transfer impedance (Ztr) to determine Raw and Rti in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys under control and bronchoconstricted conditions. Zin data between 1 and 64 Hz are frequency dependent during baseline conditions, and this frequency dependence shifts in response to A. suum or methacholine. Thus it cannot be modeled with the DuBois model, and estimates of Raw and Rti cannot be determined. With Ztr, baseline data were much less variable than Zin in all monkeys. After bronchial challenge with A. suum or methacholine, the absolute amplitude of the resistive component of Ztr increased and its zero crossing shifted to higher frequencies. These data can estimate Raw and Rti with the six-element DuBois model. Therefore, in monkeys, Ztr has advantages over other measures of lung function, since it provides a methodology to separate estimates of Raw and Rti. In conclusion, Ztr shows spectral features similar to those reported in healthy and asthmatic humans.

TI  - Load independence of radionuclide diastolic filling measurements in acute coronary occlusion.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: An accurate noninvasive method for measuring the effects of pharmacologic agents on active relaxation of the left ventricle would provide a valuable tool for monitoring the treatment of diastolic heart failure related to coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The time constant of isovolumic relaxation (T) and the left atrioventricular gradient were measured with micromanometer catheters and diastolic left ventricular filling variables were measured with radionuclide ventriculography in nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs with an acute coronary artery occlusion. Infusion of the positive inotropic drug dobutamine hydrochloride (5 to 10 micrograms/kg/min) resulted in a 35% shortening of T and a 37% increase in the radionuclide first-half filling fraction (both p < 0.05), but no change in the left atrioventricular gradient. Conversely, infusion of the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor phenylephrine hydrochloride (20 to 40 micrograms/min) augmented left ventricular load, increasing the atrioventricular gradient by 45%, but had no significant effect on T or the first-half filling fraction. Infusion of the direct-acting vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (80 to 120 micrograms/min), was accompanied by a 14% lengthening of T with a corresponding 28% decrease in the first-half filling fraction (both p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In an anesthetized, open-chest canine model of acute myocardial ischemia, the radionuclide first-half filling fraction reflects pharmacologically induced changes in the lusitropic state of the left ventricle with relative independence of loading conditions.
