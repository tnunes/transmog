TI  - Standardization of a computerized method for calculating autonomic function test responses in healthy subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - The objectives of the present study were 1) to compare results obtained by the traditional manual method of measuring heart rate (HR) and heart rate response (HRR) to the Valsalva maneuver, standing and deep breathing, with those obtained using a computerized data analysis system attached to a standard electrocardiograph machine; 2) to standardize the responses of healthy subjects to cardiovascular tests, and 3) to evaluate the response to these tests in a group of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). In all subjects (97 healthy and 143 with DM) we evaluated HRR to deep breathing. HRR to standing, HRR to the Valsalva maneuver, and blood pressure response (BPR) to standing up and to a sustained handgrip. Since there was a strong positive correlation between the results obtained with the computerized method and the traditional method, we conclude that the new method can replace the traditional manual method for evaluating cardiovascular responses with the advantages of speed and objectivity. HRR and BPR of men and women did not differ. A correlation between age and HRR was observed for standing (r = -0.48, P < 0.001) and deep breathing (r = -0.41; P < 0.002). Abnormal BPR to standing was usually observed only in diabetic patients with definite and severe degrees of autonomic neuropathy.

TI  - Current antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV infection.  
AB  - Since the introduction of the first antiretroviral agent, zidovudine (AZT) in 1987, much progress has been made in the chemotherapy of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently nine antiretroviral agents are approved for the treatment of individuals infected with HIV or with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). These medications are routinely divided into three categories: nucleoside analogues, non-nucleoside analogues, and most recently, protease inhibitors. As our knowledge of the pathogenesis of HIV increases, new antiretroviral agents become available, and advanced techniques develop to more accurately assess the degree of viral burden in an individual's blood, recommendations regarding treatment initiation and choice of antiviral agents are continually changing. The current general consensus is to "hit early" and "hit hard." Early initiation of treatment with multidrug therapy in all individuals infected with HIV is recommended by most experts with the common goal of reducing viral load to a nondetectable level. Numerous studies have shown the increased efficacy of multidrug therapy over monotherapy, however trials are still continuing to determine combination therapies which will provide the maximum benefit.

TI  - Immunohistochemical distribution of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the synovial membrane in cases of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.  
AB  - The distribution of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the synovial membrane was examined immunohistologically with anti-human collagen IV antibody and anti-human von Willebrand factor in 26 human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) samples comprising discs with adjoining synovial membrane from 10 control TMJs and from 16 TMJs with internal derangement. Three different distribution types were observed in the synovial membrane. In the control samples, the occurrence of blood capillaries and lymph capillaries was rare. In mildly hyperplastic synovitis, lymph capillaries were observed just beneath the surface of the synovial membrane, whereas blood capillaries occurred in a little deeper layer of the synovial membrane. In a severely hyperplastic synovitis, both lymph and blood capillaries were observed frequently. The present results suggest that the different distribution patterns of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries reflect the degree of synovitis but can not be attributed to specific clinical symptoms.

TI  - Isometric abduction muscle activation in patients with rotator tendinosis of the shoulder.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of pain on activation in brief maximal and sustained submaximal isometric abduction in patients with rotator tendinosis of the shoulder. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled experimental trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with complaints of at least 3 months' duration (median range, 1 to 2 years) and nine healthy controls. INTERVENTION: Patients and controls were randomized into subacromial local anesthetic injection on 2 different days. METHODS: The uninvolved shoulder was tested first, elbow flexed 90 degrees, shoulder abducted 45 degrees. The protocol consisted of three brief maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs), followed by a sustained submaximal contraction until exhaustion and three MVCs during a 20-minute recovery period. Electromyography (EMG) was obtained bilaterally from the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper trapezius, and middle deltoid muscles. Pain was scored on a visual analogue scale (0 to 100). RESULTS: Mean pain rating on MVC of the involved side of patients was reduced from 28 to 10 by subacromial injection. Mean MVC force improved from 163N to 184N (95% confidence interval for the difference, 14 to 29N). The accompanying EMG amplitude during MVC increased significantly in three of the four muscles examined. Pain, force, and EMG of the uninvolved side and in controls were unaltered. Endurance time and EMG (given as microV) during the submaximal contraction were not influenced by pain. MVC did not fully recover during the postexhaustive period, while the corresponding EMG amplitudes were comparable to values in unfatigued muscle. CONCLUSION: Pain reduced central motor drive during maximal efforts in the unfatigued state, but no additional reduction was seen after a sustained submaximal contraction.

TI  - Age related effects of restricted head movements on the useful field of view of drivers.  
AB  - Eighty drivers in a sample of four groups of 20 (10 males, 10 females), aged under 30 years ('young'), 40-59 ('middle aged'), 60-69 ('older'), and 70 years and over ('oldest'), participated in tests of head rotation and of several visual functions relevant to safe driving. Head rotation data showed that the oldest drivers had lost about 1/3 of movement and that the loss tended to be more evident in males. Second attempts almost always produced slightly better results. All participants had at least 20/40 binocular vision, however, tests of monocular visual acuity, stereovision, and horizontal peripheral vision revealed that the poorest performers were aged 60 years and over and that the degree of decrement increased with age. Many of the older and oldest drivers in the sample were both severely restricted in their ability to turn their head and evidenced a loss of visual functioning. Analysis of the effect of reduced head movement on the useful field of view indicated that, for the drivers aged 60 years and over, there was an evident restriction on the distances at which approaching traffic could be brought into the central, stationary field, so that even at maximum head rotation plus one saccade (15 degrees), approaching vehicles would not be clearly perceived beyond a distance of 50 m. The findings are discussed in relation to older drivers' involvement in intersection accidents.

TI  - Conformation of the trypanocidal pharmaceutical suramin in its free and bound forms: transferred nuclear overhauser studies.  
AB  - Suramin is a lead compound for treatment of cancer, HIV, and trypanosomiasis. The conformations of suramin in its free form and bound to phosphoglycerate kinases from T. brucei and S. cerevisae, have been studied in aqueous solutions using nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and transferred NOE NMR spectroscopies. The NOE data of the free drug can be accommodated by a model in which many of the single bonds of suramin are unrestricted at room temperature, consistent with molecular mechanics calculations. The angle between the naphthalene ring and the adjoining amide is essentially locked by a strong amide-sulfonate hydrogen bond into one preferred conformation.  Another degree of freedom near the termini of the molecule has a rather pronounced preference, and a third exhibits a nearly perpendicular arrangement between the amide and adjacent aromatic ring. The other two degrees of freedom have weaker preferences. Molecular mechanics calculations using AMBER force field and charges on amides and sulfonates obtained from semiempirical or ab initio calculations reproduced the extent of nonplanarity but not the detailed preferences. 13C spin-lattice relaxation, proton NOE, and light-scattering measurements for free suramin indicate that the correlation time of the molecule is approximately 3 ns at 5 mM concentration, suggesting that suramin is multimeric. Lowering the temperature to 5 degrees C causes a dramatic broadening of all of the resonances in the NMR spectra of 5 mM suramin. This broadening probably is associated with further aggregation into micelles. Suramin is monomeric at 0.5 mM and room temperature, and the NOE cross-relaxation rate constants are close to the cancellation condition for a 500 MHz proton frequency; this concentration is typical of blood serum concentrations when the drug is utilized in humans. Changes in the conformational preferences for terminal degrees of freedom are observed in the bound states of suramin based upon the transferred NOE data. The data for the bound state cannot be accommodated by a symmetric conformer. Analysis of the transferred NOESY buildup curves indicates complex kinetics of binding, probably involving an electrostatically bound encounter complex. Despite the weak binding constant, the buildup curves cannot be treated as population-weighted averages of the free and bound cross-relaxation rates, and therefore complete relaxation-exchange matrix analysis has been performed to simulate the data sets.

TI  - Viscoelastic behavior of plantar flexor muscle-tendon unit at rest.  
AB  - Muscle stretching as an exercise routine is widely used in orthopaedic and neurological rehabilitation. However, the muscle response to specific stretching parameters is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect parameters, such as stretch velocity, stretch extent, and initial muscle-tendon resistance, on the plantar flexor response to passive movement. Eighteen healthy subjects (23-41 years) participated in this study. Five passive ankle dorsiflexions were randomly imposed at various velocities from 5 degrees/sec to 180 degrees/sec using a Kin-Com dynamometer, while unwanted activations of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were detected with surface electrodes. The resistive torque was averaged at -10 degrees and 0 degree of dorsiflexion. As shown by analyses of variance followed by Scheffe post hoc procedures, the resistive torque was significantly increased (p < 0.01) between 5 degrees/sec and higher velocities (60 degrees/sec or 120 degrees/sec and higher). A strong linear resistive torque-velocity relationship was also observed, as indicated by Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 (-10 degrees) and 0.91 (0 degree). The absolute resistive torque increment, calculated at 180 degrees/sec, was larger at 0 degree of dorsiflexion than at the -10 degrees of dorsiflexion position. Finally, subjects with larger initial plantar flexor resistance had a higher resistive torque increment (p < 0.05) at a high velocity of stretch (180 degrees/sec) than those with less initial muscle-tendon resistance. These results indicate that 1) the nonreflex resistive torque response to stretch is velocity-sensitive and 2) both a larger stretch extent and muscle initial resistance lead to greater resistive torque increments at high velocity. These observations suggest that slow and gradual stretching procedures, rather than rapid or ballistic movements, should be used, especially with stiff muscles to reduce the chance of injury from excessively high tension.

FFS were either unprocessed or extruded at 5 different temperatures (118 degrees, 120 degrees, 122 degrees, 126 degrees and 140 degrees C) in a wet extruder. Diets were prepared with the different FFS, and a diet prepared with soyabean meal (SBM) was included as a control. The 7 experimental diets were fed to individual groups of 40 chickens each, for a period of 35 d. Trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), urease activity (UA), and protein solubility in potassium hydroxide (PS) were measured in all FFS and in the SBM. 3. Diets prepared with raw FFS and FFS extruded at 118 degrees and 120 degrees C resulted in significantly lower body weights and in pancreatic hypertrophy; maximum growth rate was obtained with FFS extruded at 122 degrees and 126 degrees C, while minimum pancreas weight was seen in chickens fed FFS extruded at 140 degrees C. 4. Although TIA, UA, and PS all decreased with increasing temperature of extrusion, TIA provided the best prediction of the feeding value of soyabeans for chickens.

TI  - Clinical significance of cytogenetic findings in solid tumors.  
AB  - Chromosome analysis of solid tumors is becoming an increasingly useful tool to help establish a correct diagnosis and to provide prognostically important information. Characteristic karyotypic patterns in terms of degree of cytogenetic complexity and type of nonrandom abnormalities may help to distinguish neoplasia from a nonneoplastic lesion and to differentiate between a benign and a malignant tumor. More importantly, the presence of a specific or pathognomonic change may confirm or refute a suspected diagnosis, provide an alternative, unsuspected diagnosis, and trace the origin of a metastasis. Presently, specific cytogenetic abnormalities may be of substantial, and sometimes decisive, help in four groups of differential diagnostic dilemmas: (1) Benign vs. malignant epithelial tumors of the kidney, thyroid gland, salivary glands, and ovary; (2) Benign vs. malignant mesenchymal tumors of adipose and muscle tissue; (3) Differentiation between various malignant bone and soft tissue tumors: and (4) Diagnosis of undifferentiated small-cell round-cell tumors. In addition to the diagnostic value, karyotypic findings may provide prognostic information. Thus, the presence of an abnormal clone and/or complex rearrangements is a poor prognostic sign in, e.g., carcinomas of the ovary, prostate, bladder, colon, and pancreas. Furthermore, characteristic cytogenetic aberrations are now known to be valuable prognostic parameters in malignant melanoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, germ cell tumors, neuroblastoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region. Many of the correlation analyses are preliminary, but they all point in the same direction, namely that cytogenetic studies will soon play the same essential role in the management of patients with solid tumors as they do today in hematologic oncology.

TI  - [Myosin isoforms in skeletal muscle in patients with chronic heart decompensation: distribution and correlation with with exercise tolerance]  
AB  - Chronic heart failure (CHF) is accompanied by a reduced exercise capacity, and the symptoms can be at least in part explained by qualitative and quantitative changes in the skeletal muscle composition and metabolism. We have correlated the myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition of the gastrocnemius in 20 patients with different degrees of CHF to expiratory gases measured during maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing, NYHA functional class and echocardiographic parameters. MHC composition was determined electrophoretically in skeletal muscle needle microbiopsies and the percent distribution calculated by laser densitometry. There was no correlation between ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and MHC composition. The percentage of MHC 1 (slow aerobic isoform) was positively correlated with peak VO2 (r2 = 0.5, p = 0.0004), ventilatory threshold (VT, r2 = 0.33, p = 0.008), and O2 pulse (peak VO2/HR, r2 = 0.40, p = 0.003). There was a negative correlation between MHC 2a and 2b (fast isoforms) and peak VO2 (r2 = 0.38 and 0.37, p = 0.004, respectively), VT (r2 = 0.2, p = 0.05; r2 = 0.34, p = 0.007, respectively) and O2 pulse (r2 = 0.39, p = 0.003; r2 = 0.23, p = 0.03, respectively). NYHA functional class was also negatively correlated with the same parameters (r2 = 0.2, p = 0.01; r2 = 0.4, p = 0.001; r2 = 0.34, p = 0.006, respectively) as well as with MHC 1 (r2 = 0.62, p = 0.0001). A positive correlation was found between NYHA functional class and MHC 2a and 2b (r2 = 0.46, p = 0.001; r2 = 0.41, p = 0.002, respectively). The severity of heart failure is paralleled by a shift of the MHC pattern toward the fast MHC 2b. The correlation between the magnitude of the MHCs shift, from the slow aerobic to the fast type, with both clinical parameters (NYHA functional class) and functional measurements (peak VO2, VT, O2 pulse) of exercise capacity seem to suggest that changes in skeletal muscle composition may play a key role in exercise tolerance in patients with CHF.

TI  - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates the excitotoxin-induced behavioral and neurochemical deficits in a rodent model of Huntington's disease.  
AB  - The present study determined the effects of intraventricularly administered glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on the behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum. Distinct asymmetrical rotational behavior in response to peripheral administration of amphetamine (5 mg/kg) was noted one and two weeks following injections of quinolinic acid (200 nmol) into two sites in the left striatum. In rats given a single intraventricular injection of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (10-1000 micrograms) 30 min before the toxin, amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was significantly attenuated. Analysis of Nissl-stained coronal sections showed marked neuronal loss in the striatum ipsilateral to the quinolinic acid injections, which was at least partially prevented by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor D1 and D2 dopamine binding sites in the striatum, the majority of which are localized to subpopulations of GABAergic neurons, were decreased to a similar extent by quinolinic acid. Moreover, the reduction was attenuated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor treatment to a similar degree, suggesting that the two subpopulations of GABAergic striatal output neurons are equally vulnerable to excitotoxic damage. Concomitant changes in neurotransmitter function as a result of the lesion were also observed: [3H]GABA uptake into striatal target tissues (globus pallidus and substantia nigra) was considerably reduced in the lesioned compared to the contralateral unlesioned tissues, as were [3H]choline and [3H]dopamine uptake into striatal synaptosomes. Similarly, striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was decreased by the lesion. Decrements in neuropeptide levels of similar magnitude were evident ipsilateral to the lesion; substance P, met-enkephalin and dynorphin A contents in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra were significantly reduced. Striatal somatostatin and neuropeptide Y levels were not altered. All of the neurochemical deficits induced by striatal quinolinic acid lesions were attenuated by intraventricular delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Continuous intraventricular infusion of this trophic factor (10 micrograms/day) over a two-week period did not afford notable improvement compared to the single injection of 10 micrograms. In contrast, continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (10 micrograms/day) directly into the striatum did not affect any of the neurochemical parameters studied. However, neurotrophin-3 (10 micrograms/day) delivery into the striatum significantly increased [3H]GABA uptake, but only modestly affected [3H]choline uptake. The results indicate that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor counteracts neuronal damage induced by a striatal excitotoxic insult and support its potential use as a treatment for central nervous system disorders that may be a consequence of excitotoxic processes, such as Huntington's disease.

TI  - [Arterial hypertension and exercise]  
AB  - Both dynamic and static exercise increase blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive patients, but the change varies among these two main forms of exercise. The validity of the blood pressure response to acute exercise as a predictor for the future development of hypertension in normotensives, or of the degree of target organ damage in hypertensives is still not clear. This acute response could be an independent predictor of mortality or cardiovascular events in the normotensives. The postexercise hypotension could work as a beneficial mechanism to reduce the reduce the rise in pressure that occurs with time. While epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness and blood pressure, longitudinal studies seem to confirm the hypotensive effect of dynamic aerobic training. Though possibly in a lesser degree, strength training has also been proved to be effective. Among the responsible mechanisms, a decrease in sympathetic nerve activity is most likely involved. Hypertension seems to be also associated with a lower maximal capacity, that could be even more adversely affected by the action of certain antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics or beta-blockers. All of these aspects have led to the acceptance of physical exercise among the non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Evaluating the role of Th0 and Th1 clones in autoimmune thyroid disease by use of Hu-SCID chimeras.  
AB  - To study the role of Th0 and Th1 cells in autoimmune thyroid disease, thyroid tissues from patients with Graves' disease (GD), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), and colloid nodular disease were xenografted into SCID mice, followed by ip injection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), T cell lines, and T cell clones (TCC). The antigen-specific TCC reactive to TSH receptor (TSH-R), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), or thyroglobulin (Tg), and their respective peptides, were classified into Th0 (secreting IL-4 and/or IL-5 and IFN-gamma) and Th1 (secreting IFN-gamma) according to their cytokine profile. Engraftment of autologous or HLA-matched allogeneic CD4+ thyroid-specific clones with Th0 or Th1 phenotypes induced the production of total IgG and thyroid-specific autoantibodies by B cells present in xenografted thyroid tissues. TSH-R-specific clones mainly enhanced thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) production, while clones reactive to TPO and Tg increased the synthesis of TPO and Tg autoantibodies. Total IgG production, but not TSAb, was also stimulated by PBMC and TSH-R lines. TSAb correlated with the viability and hyperplasia of thyroid follicles, but not with the serum T3 levels, which were normal. Thyroid tissue viability was maintained or increased by antigen-specific Th0 clones, and decreased by Th1 clones reactive to TSH-R or TPO. Thyroid lymphocytic infiltration was variable; however, Th0 and Th1 clones from HT patients caused high degree of lymphocytic infiltration compared to the control groups. These results demonstrate for the first time that T cells clones reactive to specific epitopes of TSH-R, TPO, or Tg can generate antibody-mediated and/or cell-mediated responses in the xenografted thyroid tissue microenvironment. Such effects depend on clonal specificity, HLA class II restriction, and cytokine profile of the clone. Th0 clones reactive to TSH-R stimulate both total IgG production and TSAb in SCID mice engrafted with thyroid tissue from GD patients. Th0 and Th1 clones specific for TPO and Tg also function as helper T cells, stimulating total IgG synthesis and autoantibodies against TPO and Tg. Th1 clones may also cause tissue destruction in GD and HT.

TI  - Functional anatomy of the thoracic outlet: evaluation with spiral CT.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the anatomic characteristics of the thoracic outlet before and after dynamically induced modifications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two volunteers (24 women; 28 men; mean age, 42 years) with no clinical or radiographic indications of thoracic outlet syndrome underwent spiral computed tomography (CT) of the apexes at full inspiration with the arms alongside the body and then with the dominant arm in hyperabduction, with a contralateral rotation of the head. RESULTS: After elevation of the dominant arm, (a) no statistically significant difference was found in median value of the costosubclavian and costoclavicular distances; (b) the median distance between the posterior border of the smaller pectoral muscle and the anterosuperior chest wall was 12 mm in all subjects; (c) the subclavian artery in 18 (75%) women and in 20 (71%) men and/or the subclavian vein in three (12%) women and in three (11%) men were identified in the costoclavicular space. The median angles of rotation, retraction, and upward displacement of the clavicle were 22 degrees, 32 degrees, and 7 degrees, respectively, in women and 25 degrees, 31 degrees, and 11 degrees, respectively, in men. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is expected to be useful for determining the complex pathophysiologic processes that underlie thoracic outlet syndrome.

TI  - Variations of remodeling in response to left main atherosclerosis assessed with intravascular ultrasound in vivo.  
AB  - Histopathologic studies have demonstrated that vessels enlarge to compensate for an increase in plaque burden; this has been confirmed in vivo using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The initial studies suggested a biphasic course of lesion formation with (1) preservation of lumen dimensions up to a plaque burden of approximately 40%, and (2) luminal narrowing as plaque burden further increases. In this study, we used IVUS and angiography to assess the extent of left main (LM) atherosclerosis in 107 patients undergoing catheter-based procedures of the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary arteries. Using IVUS, atherosclerotic plaques were found in all LM arteries, but only 26 (24%) had varying degrees of luminal narrowing on the angiogram. Nevertheless, there was an inverse relation (r = -0.62, p <0.0001) between the minimal lumen area and the plaque burden (i.e., plaque + media divided by total vessel area) that was not restricted to plaque burden values >40% (or >30%), but persisted at plaque burden values of 20% to 40%. In addition, LM arteries with a plaque burden <40% had a similar total vessel area as did LM arteries with a plaque burden > or =40% (22.9 +/- 6.1 vs 21.8 +/- 4.8 mm2, p = 0.30). These data suggest that lumen dimensions may not be preserved even if plaque occupies no more than 20% to 40% of the total vessel area. Thus, there is more variation in remodeling response during earlier stages of plaque accumulation within the LM artery than is commonly suggested.

TI  - A gamma detector probe with ex vivo detection of carcinoid tumors superior to intraoperative palpation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the generally successful scintigraphic detection of endocrine tumors with [(111)In]-DTPA-D-[Phe1]-octreotide (OctreoScan, Mallinckrodt Medical, Petten, The Netherlands), its intraoperative application awaits the development of suitable gamma detectors. This study describes a novel probe (H-probe2) and its ex vivo efficacy for the detection of midgut carcinoid tumors. METHODS: The probe measures 180 mm x 24 mm, and contains a bismuth germinate crystal connected to a photomultiplicator tube, a lead shield, and a tantalum collimator with an angled, 3-mm wide opening. It was characterized in a test bench utilizing solublilized (111)In and 99mTc, and 8 fresh operative specimens containing 26 histologically verified midgut carcinoid tumors (2-40 mm) from patients exposed to OctreoScan. Measurements were made at 2.5-mm intervals over the entire specimens and presented three dimensionally. RESULTS: The test bench analysis supported efficient shielding, and a total collimation of 27 degrees for (111)In and 20 degrees for 99mTc. In addition to 18 palpable tumors, 4 of 6 surgically occult tumors (2-3 mm in dimension) could be discovered with H-probe2. Small tumors in close apposition to a large tumor could not be separated. Wellcounter examination showed that tumors detected with the H-probe2 exhibited 1.7-84.1 times higher radionuclide uptake than the surrounding normal tissue. CONCLUSION: Ex vivo analysis of H-probe2 supported detection of tumors inaccessible to surgical palpation, but its clinical efficiency awaits intraoperative evaluation.

TI  - Structural characterization of the myoglobin active site using infrared crystallography.  
AB  - We use polarized IR absorption on single crystals to determine the orientation of carbon monoxide bound at the active site of myoglobin, and conclude that the C-O bond lies approximately 7 degrees from the normal to the mean plane of the heme. This result disagrees with much larger angular displacements reported in structural models derived from X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements. The insensitivity of the IR-derived orientation to changes in pH or crystal packing contrasts with the wide variations in CO orientation among diffraction-based models and suggests that the latter are in error. The small energies required to displace the C-O bond 7 degrees from its energetically preferred upright geometry suggest that distortion of the surrounding protein, rather than the relatively undeformable Fe-C-O unit, is the main steric mechanism inhibiting CO binding to myoglobin.

TI  - The use of hyperventilation in contrast-enhanced MR of brain tumors.  
AB  - Angiographic studies have demonstrated improved visibility of glial tumors after hyperventilation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether hyperventilation would change the MR enhancement characteristics of various glial tumors. Eighteen patients were studied twice: once with standard contrast-enhanced MR imaging and again with standard imaging plus hyperventilation. After hyperventilation, six low-grade astrocytomas showed no change and three showed a small decrease in relative enhancement (<10%). The ependymomas showed a 10% to 13% increase in the degree of enhancement, but no change in the area of enhancement. All the anaplastic astrocytomas showed an increase in the degree of enhancement (mean, 38%). Three of the anaplastic astrocytomas showed new foci of enhancement that were not seen on the nonhyperventilation study. Hyperventilation appears to be an inexpensive and safe method for increasing the conspicuity of abnormal areas of the blood-brain barrier.

TI  - Analysis of the degree of QRS fusion necessary for its visual detection: importance for the recognition of transient entrainment.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed fusion is the hallmark for the demonstration of transient entrainment. However, the degree of accuracy of its recognition on the surface ECG is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ability to detect fusion in the QRS complex. METHODS AND RESULTS: While pacing the ventricles at a fixed rate, a model of ventricular fusion was created by introducing late extra stimuli at a second site. In this model, the presence and degree of fusion are known. Pacing sites were the RV apex, outflow tract, and left ventricle in various configurations. We analyzed 433 QRS complexes with different degrees of fusion (or no fusion) in 21 patients. Each QRS was "read" by three investigators blinded to intracardiac recordings but having a reference QRS with no fusion. There was a statistically significant correlation between the degree of fusion and its recognition. Fusion was detected with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 87%. Fusion was accurately detected in all configurations only when >22% of the QRS was fused. In patients with organic left ventricular disease, fusion was better recognized when the driving pacing site was the left ventricle than when it was a right ventricular site. The interobserver agreement was moderate between two pairs of observers and only fair between the remaining pair. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an accurate detection of ventricular fusion can only be accomplished when fusion occurs during a significant proportion of the QRS duration. The potential lack of recognition of minor degrees of fusion may produce underdetection of transient entrainment.

TI  - Role of asymmetric phosphate neutralization in DNA bending by PU.1.  
AB  - The PU.1 transcription factor is a member of the Ets family of DNA binding proteins. PU.1 binds to DNA via a loop-helix-loop domain and functions in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The structure of a PU.1-DNA complex was recently reported (Kodandapani, R., Pio, F., Ni, C.-Z., Piccialli, G., Klemsz, M., McKercher, S., Maki, R., and Ely, K. (1996) Nature 380, 456-460). The DNA in this complex is deformed by 8 degrees as it curves around the protein. The pattern of electrostatic contacts between PU.1, and its DNA binding site suggests that laterally asymmetric phosphate neutralization accompanies PU.1 binding. Because of our previous studies showing that such neutralization can induce bending in naked DNA, we have explored the effect of phosphate neutralization by substituting neutral methylphosphonate internucleoside linkages at relevant positions within DNA containing the PU.1 binding sequence. Consistent with the prediction that DNA will collapse toward its partially neutralized surface, DNA neutralized at seven positions to simulate PU.1 binding is observed to bend by 28 degrees . The directions of DNA curvature are slightly different in the co-crystal versus the partially neutralized duplexes. The electrostatic component of the binding energy appears more than enough to account for the DNA bending observed in the PU.1-DNA complex.

TI  - Effect(s) of the demineralization process on the osteoinductivity of demineralized bone matrix.  
AB  - The relationships between residual calcium levels and particle size of ground demineralized bone matrix and its osteoinductive potential were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays. The effects of variable residual calcium levels, variable particle sizes, and donor age and gender were studied using a tissue culture-based bioassay (in vitro) as well as an athymic mouse (in vivo) bioassay. The osteoinductive potential of the bone-derived biomaterial was assessed by measuring the degree of new bone formation (change in percent calcium content after 4 weeks of implantation) in the in vivo assay and levels of alkaline phosphatase activity associated with cultures of human periosteal cells (HPO cells) in the in vitro assay, respectively. Slightly demineralized bone matrix and overly demineralized bone matrix possessed a degree of osteoinductive potential whereas bone demineralized to levels of approximately 2% residual calcium provided for maximum osteoinductive potential in both assay systems. The osteoinductive potential of ground demineralized bone varied relative to the particle size such that DBM particles ranging from 500 to 710 microns provided for the highest level of calcium deposition (increase of 8.1 weight percent calcium) after 4 weeks of implantation in muscle pouches of an athymic mouse, whereas explanted particles less than 250 microns showed the lowest level of calcium deposition (increase of only 2.8 weight percent calcium). In the donor age and gender study, DBM from different donors were divided into 5 age groups for both female and male donor derived bone: less than 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50, and 51 to 60 year old age groups. This study indicated that DBM from female donors in the 31 to 40 years old age group and male donors in the 41 to 50 year age group possess the highest osteoinductive potential, whereas DBM derived from donor bone from both female and male donors in the 51 to 60 year age group presented the lowest osteoinductive potential. DBM derived from male and female donors did not in general show significant differences in osteoinductive potential.

TI  - T3 treatment increases mitosis, then bax expression and apoptosis in the optic lobe of the chick embryo.  
AB  - We investigated T3 effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the optic lobe of the chick embryo between embryonic days (E) 6 and 11. Injection of T3 into the yolk increased [3H]thymidine incorporation between E7 and E9. This increased mitosis was followed by altered timing and degree of apoptosis during E9-11. In T3-treated embryos a marked increase in apoptosis occurred on E10, coincident with increased levels of mRNA encoding Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein. By E11, the overall morphology and total number of cells in each layer of the optic lobe were not different in control and treated embryos. Thus, although T3 transiently increases cell number, a homeostatic mechanism enters into play re-adjusting the balance between cellular proliferation and cell death.

TI  - Asymmetric papilledema in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: prospective interocular comparison of sensory visual function.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Visual loss is the main morbidity of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The relationship between papilledema grade and visual loss is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between papilledema grade and visual loss. METHODS: Fundus photographs of 478 patients with IIH were reviewed, and their degree of papilledema was graded using Frisen's scheme. We identified 46 patients (10%) with IIH and highly asymmetric papilledema, as defined by an interocular difference of two or more grades. Nine of these patients with active asymmetry agreed to return for a series of visual tests. They underwent three visual field tests-Humphrey visual field analyzer 24-2, motion perimetry, and ring perimetry. The perimetry outcome measures were mean deviation, foveal threshold, and means for eccentric zones (3 degrees, 9 degrees, 15 degrees, and 21 degrees). The patients participated also in visual acuity, Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity, and foveal flicker fusion testing. Their relative afferent pupillary defect was graded using neutral density filters. RESULTS: The intereye comparisons showed vision to be worse in the eye with the high-grade papilledema for all outcome measures. The magnitude of the loss with the perimetry tests increased with eccentricity. The measures of central visual function, although in the normal range, were relatively depressed in the eye with high-grade papilledema. CONCLUSIONS: Visual loss in patients with asymmetric papilledema caused by IIH was most pronounced in the eye with the higher grade of papilledema. Foveal visual functions, although they remained in the normal range, were also decreased in patients with high-grade papilledema. In patients with high-grade papilledema, visual loss appeared to affect the entire visual field, and the peripheral field showed the most deficit. Our findings showed that high-grade papilledema was associated with visual dysfunction in patients with IIH.

Whereas in the early stage only soft tissue mutations (bursitis inflammation) and light calcium deposits are usually discernible, chronic gout leads to asymmetrical, diverse forms of osseous destruction, favouring smaller joints, but also affecting larger ones, which are caused by the intra-articular and extra-articular deposit of tophus material, corresponding to the progression and degree of severity of the illness.

TI  - [Radiologic findings in gout]  
AB  - Radiological gout manifestations are detectable in the early stage, but also especially in the chronic stage of gout. Whereas in the early stage only soft tissue mutations (bursitis inflammation) and light calcium deposits are usually discernible, chronic gout leads to asymmetrical, diverse forms of osseous destruction, favouring smaller joints, but also affecting larger ones, which are caused by the intra-articular and extra-articular deposit of tophus material, corresponding to the progression and degree of severity of the illness. Radiologically-detectable changes in other organs, such as the kidneys, will be addressed. The high number of, and to some extent very characteristic, osseous mutations are compared with those mutations which are very similar to the diagnoses of other syndromes affecting the joints. Specifically, problems in differentiating diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis psoriatica, chondrocalcinosis, and other diseases of the joints will receive special mention. Reference is also made to the extreme diagnostic difficulties resulting from the rare but nevertheless conceivable influence of gout on the spine or sacroiliac joints. The method of magnetic resonance imaging for gout shows a characteristic signal behaviour of the tophus material. It has been determined that, through magnetic resonance tomography, interosseous tophi can be detected earlier and in a more widespread manner than with the aid of native X-ray images, such that an increase in the use of this method is to be expected.

AB  - In this study we compared the behaviour of the non-porous on one side ePTFE Dual Mesh prosthesis and the macroporous polypropylene mesh Marlex in the repair of abdominal wall defects in rabbits. We evaluated the degree of integration with recipient tissue, biological tolerance, adhesion formation with viscera and the biomechanical resistance of the repair zone. Our results showed good biological tolerance of both prostheses and a high degree of adhesion formation in Marlex implants. In animals with Dual Mesh implants, only loose adhesions were seen. Marlex implants induced the presence of disorganized scar tissue, while the Dual Mesh prostheses were encapsulated by organized tissue. The macrophage response was similar in both decreasing with time. The resistance to traction was higher when the reparation was done with polypropylene. We concluded that the structure of the prosthesis determines its degree of integration and the resistance to traction of the repaired zone.

TI  - Rehabilitation of dogs with surgically treated cranial cruciate ligament-deficient stifles by use of electrical stimulation of muscles.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine effect of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on rate and degree of return to function of the limb and development of degenerative joint disease (DJD) after surgical creation and subsequent stabilization of the cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL)-deficient stifle. ANIMALS: 12 clinically normal adult large (19.5 to 31.5 kg) dogs. PROCEDURE: Dogs were anesthetized, and the right CrCL was severed via arthrotomy, destabilizing the stifle. After 3 weeks, the stifle was surgically stabilized. Three weeks later, 6 dogs were subjected to an EMS treatment protocol for the thigh muscles. At 5, 9, 13, and 19 weeks after stifle destabilization, treated (n = 6) and control (n = 6) dogs were evaluated for return of stifle function. Gross and histologic evaluations of the stifles were performed at 19 weeks after stifle destabilization. RESULTS: Treated dogs had significantly (P = 0.001) better lameness score than did control dogs. There was less palpable crepitation of the stifle in treated dogs (P = 0.06); treated dogs also had significantly (P = 0.01) fewer radiographic signs of bone changes. Thigh circumference was significantly (P = 0.02) larger in treated dogs. There was less gross cartilage damage (P = 0.07) in the EMS-treated dogs, but more medial meniscal damage (P = 0.058, cranial pole; P = 0.051, caudal pole). CONCLUSIONS: Improved lameness scores, larger thigh circumference, and decreased radiographically apparent bony changes observed for the treated group of dogs support the hypothesis that dogs treated by EMS after surgical stabilization of the CrCL-deficient stifle had improved limb function, with less DJD, than did dogs treated with the currently accepted clinical protocol of cage rest and slow return to normal activity. However, results of force plate evaluation did not support the hypothesis. Increased meniscal damage in dogs treated by EMS may be cause for concern.

AB  - This retrospective study analyzes the accuracy of a prediction algorithm from Quick Ceph Image. Pre- and postsurgical lateral cephalograms of 35 adult patients were computer imaged and specific landmarks digitized. Digitization error was assessed from duplicate digitizations. Sixteen measurements of the predicted and actual postsurgical hard and soft tissue landmarks were compared using Student's t test, one- and two-way analysis of variance, and a modified Bradley-Blackwood test. Results showed a good correlation between repeated digitization of all variables except soft tissue point B and E-plane. Comparison of the predicted and actual changes found that all differences were less than 1.8 mm or 3.1 degrees. Student's t test showed 10 of the 16 measurements did not differ significantly, and interclass correlation demonstrated moderate to good correlations for 13 of 16 variables. Overall the results of this study suggest that the magnitude of the differences were within clinically acceptable limits.

AB  - Difficulties associated with current intensive induction regimens for multiple myeloma and uncertainty as to how to achieve optimal peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation (PBPC) prompted this study of an oral induction regimen, Z-Dex (oral idarubicin and dexamethasone) followed by PBPC mobilisation using four different regimens. Thirty-patients received Z-Dex (median age 56 years, range 46-66 years) including 24 patients with previously untreated disease. The overall response rate was 75% with a CR rate of 16.7% and PR rate of 75.7% in patients with previously untreated disease. We compared four mobilisation regimens: low-dose (LD) cyclophosphamide, high-dose (HD) cyclophosphamide, cis-platin/VP16 and cis-platin, Ara-C and dexamethasone (DHAP). Failure to mobilise optimal numbers of PBPCs (>1.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and >20 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg) was seen in two patients who received LD cyclophosphamide, in two patients who received HD cyclophosphamide and three patients who received cis-platin/VP16. No patient failed to mobilise adequate numbers of PBPCs following DHAP. In previously untreated patients, DHAP mobilised significantly more PBPC than LD cyclophosphamide (P=0.02), HD cyclophosphamide (P=0.0015) and cis-platin/VP16 (P=0.021). This study demonstrates the efficacy of Z-Dex in inducing tumour responses in patients with multiple myeloma without limiting PBPC mobilisation in subsequent dose-intensive schedules. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that DHAP is superior to cyclophosphamide (low- and high-dose) and cis-platin/VP16 in mobilising PBPCs and demonstrated a degree of tumour control.

TI  - Changing patterns of gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin distribution in mouse epidermis and hair follicles during embryonic development.  
AB  - In the mouse embryo between embryonic days 12 (E12) and 16, regular arrays of epidermal placodes on the mystacial pad develop into whisker follicles. This system was chosen for analysis of gap junctional intercellular communication during differentiation. The patterns of communication were studied by microinjection of the tracers Lucifer yellow-CH (LY-CH) and neurobiotin (NB), while immunofluorescent staining was used to study distribution of connexins 26 and 43. Extensive communication was seen between keratinocytes in developing hair pegs or, in later-stage hair follicles, in the germinative matrix. Coupling between adjacent hair pegs via interfollicular epidermis was not observed. Coupling also became restricted as follicular cells differentiated to form outer root sheath, inner root sheath, and hair shaft. Extensive gap junctional coupling is characteristic of keratinocytes that are rapidly proliferating (as in hair pegs and germinative matrix). Follicular keratinocytes commence differentiation shortly before restriction of gap junctional coupling becomes evident. Dermal mesenchymal cells undergoing different modes of differentiation also exhibit differences in gap junctional coupling, as evidenced by poor transfer of LY-CH between cells in dermal condensations of hair follicles compared with extensive transfer elsewhere in the dermis. LY-CH and NB were not transferred between epidermal or follicular epithelium and mesenchyme, arguing against a direct role for gap junctions permeable to known second messenger molecules or nucleotides in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in this system. The distribution of connexins 26 and 43 in epidermis and hair follicles changed during differentiation but there was no correlation with changing patterns of dye transfer, indicating an unexpected degree of complexity in the relationship between gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin protein distribution during development.

TI  - The area of complete scotopic spatial summation enlarges with age.  
AB  - The maximal area of complete scotopic spatial summation (Ricco's area) was determined for 50 subjects ranging in age from 19 to 87 yr. Increment thresholds were measured for 10-ms, 520-nm circular test lights of varying diameters that were superimposed and concentric with a 10 degrees, 640-nm circular background. The test lights were imaged in Maxwellian view along the horizontal meridian, 6 degrees nasal from a foveal fixation point. The results demonstrate a statistically significant enlargement of Ricco's area with age. The average angular subtenses of Ricco's areas for the ten youngest (mean = 26 yr) and ten oldest (mean = 75 yr) observers were approximately 48 and 69 arc min, respectively. Model simulations based on a series of optical transfer functions of the eye and varying degrees of intraocular light scatter for younger and older observers show that preneural factors cannot account for these results. Therefore changes in neural mechanisms must be invoked to explain the enlargement in the size of Ricco's area under scotopic conditions.

TI  - Almost exclusive androgenic action of dehydroepiandrosterone in the rat mammary gland.  
AB  - To determine the relative role of the androgenic and/or estrogenic components of the action of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on the histomorphology and structure of the rat mammary gland, ovariectomized (OVX) female animals received DHEA administered alone or in combination with the pure antiandrogen flutamide or the pure antiestrogen EM-800 for 12 months. We have also evaluated the effect of estradiol (E2) and dihydrotestosterone constantly released from SILASTIC brand silicon implants as well as medroxyprogesterone acetate released from poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres. While 1-yr OVX resulted in a severe atrophy of the mammary gland, treatment of OVX animals with DHEA stimulated lobuloalveolar and ductal growth, as well as the secretory activity of the acinar cells, thus resulting in a lobuloalveolar type of development of the mammary gland. The addition of FLU to DHEA almost completely prevented the stimulatory effect observed with DHEA alone, whereas addition of the antiestrogen EM-800 had no significant effect on the action of DHEA on the mammary gland. At the doses used, medroxyprogesterone acetate and dihydrotestosterone also stimulated ductal and alveolar development, although to a lesser degree than that achieved with DHEA. The stimulatory effect of estradiol was mainly expressed on ductal growth with a smaller stimulatory effect on lobuloalveolar development. The above-indicated stimulatory effects on lobuloalveolar development were also reflected in significant increases of the total and parenchymal gland surface areas of the mammary gland. The present study shows that androgens induce a marked lobuloalveolar type of development of the mammary gland in the rat. Moreover, these data indicate the highly predominant or almost exclusive androgenic component in the potent stimulatory action of DHEA on the histomorphology and structure of the rat mammary gland. In fact, blockade of the potential estrogenic component of DHEA action by EM-800 did not affect the stimulatory action of DHEA on mammary gland histomorphology, whereas the antiandrogen FLU almost completely blocked the effect of DHEA.

AB  - We have reviewed the results of 30 operations performed on 23 patients with Ficat stage-III or stage-IV osteonecrosis of the femoral head in which autogenous cortical and cancellous bone grafting had been performed through a so-called trapdoor made in the femoral head. At a mean of 56 months (30 to 60) after operation 20 of 24 stage-III hips (83%) had a good or excellent result as determined by the Harris hip-scoring system. Two of six stage-IV hips (33%) had good or excellent results. Eighteen of 21 hips (86%) with a combined necrotic angle of 200 degrees had good or excellent clinical results compared with only four of nine hips (44%) with a combined necrotic angle of more than 200 degrees. Six of the eight hips which had fair or poor results were in patients who had received corticosteroids; five of these six hips had lesions with a combined necrotic angle of greater than 200 degrees or were in a late stage (stage IV). There were no perioperative complications. Our results suggest that the trapdoor procedure with autogenous cancellous and cortical bone grafting can be successful in Ficat and Arlet stage-III osteonecrosis of the hip in patients with small- to medium-sized lesions.

TI  - [Changes in ovarian activity after superovulation treatment in sheep]  
AB  - Serine proteases are involved in a number of biological processes requiring degradation of intracellular matrices in tissue growing and its rebuilding. These are situations during the growth and maturing of ovarian follicles and their conversion into corpus luteum. Trypsin activity of similar serine proteases are controlled by their inhibitors whose synthesis and secretion is regulated by endocrine, paracrine as well as autocrine mechanisms. The fertility in natural ovarian cycle is ensured by the balance between a number of factors. After superovulatory stimulations this balance is impaired to a different degree. The presented study has been aimed at the investigations of the effect of various combinations of serum gonadotropins (PMSG, Antex Leo, Denmark), choriongonadotropins (hCG, Praedyn, Leciva Praha, CR), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, Foliocotropin, Spofa, Leciva Praha, CR) and anti-PMSG (goats antiserum against PMSG, Bioveta Ivanovice, CR) administered in the oestrum period after synchronization (12 days) by Agelin vaginal sponges (20 mg of chlorosuperlutine per animal; Galena Komarov, SR) on changes of some reproduction characteristics in ovaries and levels of catecholamines in follicular fluid. Changes in the ovarian weight were statistically significant in groups after administration of combined PMSG + hCG (750 + 750 IU; p < 0.01), PMSG + hCG + anti-PMSG (750 + 750 + 5 ml; p < 0.02) doses of hormones and FSH (2 x 80 + 2 x 80 + 1 x 40 + 1 x 40 IU; p < 0.01) during 4 days. Average numbers of prominating follicles and trypsin-inhibitory activity (TIA) values of their follicular fluid (FT) were influenced by LH component of stimulating hormones what was, on the contrary, manifested as by occurrence of the category of follicles over 10 mm as by their significantly higher TIA FT (p < 0.01). In as much as mean values of TIA blood plasma which were on average 10 times lower than in FT, were changed in a different way, it is supposed that synthesis and secretion of TIA in FT is affected by local mechanisms (Gosden et al., 1988; Smokovitis et al., 1988; Monget et al., 1996). It follows from studies of the used hormonal preparations on levels of catecholamines in ovine follicular fluid that DA and NE concentrations changed in dependence on the superovulatory stimulation used. Administration of PMSG (1000 IU) resulted in significant decrease of DA levels (p < 0.01) and EPI (p < 0.05) in ovine follicular fluid. Anti-PMSG serum application partially modified the DA and EPI levels to those of the control group. After hormonal stimulation by PMSG and hCG different effect has been observed. Antisergon application after the given combination of hormones had no effect on the EPI and NE levels in ovine follicular fluid but resulted in the increase of DA content (p < 0.05). The most conspicuous effect on the catecholamine level in follicular fluid was induced by FSH after which follows a marked increase of DA (p < 0.01) and NE (p < 0.01) levels. Similar significant effect of FSH on the change of catecholamine levels and on MAO activity in reproductory organs of sheep and in regulatory regions of reproduction were recorded in our previous contributions.

TI  - Cholesterol mobilization and regression of atheroma in cholesterol-fed rabbits induced by large unilamellar vesicles.  
AB  - The antiatherogenic properties of repeated injections of egg phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 100 nm diameter were tested in an experimental model for atherosclerosis. Forty eight rabbits were divided into two diet groups fed standard rabbit chow or fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (0.5% by weight) to induce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Prior to the initiation of LUV therapy, the cholesterol diet was ceased and all animals were returned to standard rabbit chow. The treatment protocol consisted of a total of 10 bolus injections of vesicles, at a phospholipid dose of 300 mg/kg body weight or the equivalent volume of saline, with one injection given to each animal every 10 days. LUV injections brought about a large movement of cholesterol into the blood pool and resulted in a significant reduction in the cholesterol content as well as the degree of surface plaque involvement of aortic tissue in atherosclerotic animals. Most notably, the thoracic aorta of LUV-treated animals exhibited a 48% reduction in tissue cholesterol content per gram of protein compared to saline-treated controls. Histochemical analyses revealed that aortas from animals receiving the repeated injections of LUVs displayed less cholesterol deposits in lesions, and a moderate reduction in intimal-to-medial thickness. This regression of atheroma, induced by LUV therapy, was observed even though animals possessed persistent elevated plasma cholesterol levels after the cholesterol-enriched diet was ceased. These results suggest that repeated injections of LUVs, working with endogenous HDL, may be a useful therapy in the management of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Spatial orientation in humans: perception of angular whole-body displacements in two-dimensional trajectories.  
AB  - Vestibular perception of whole-body passive rotation in the horizontal plane was studied by applying two-dimensional (2D) motion to eight blindfolded healthy volunteers: pure rotations in place, corner-like trajectories and arcs of a circular trajectory were randomly applied by means of a remotely controlled robot. Angles embedded in the 2D trajectories were 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees and 180 degrees. Stimulation of semicircular canals was the same for all trajectories but was accompanied by concurrent otolith stimulation during circular motion. Subjects participated in two successive experimental sessions. In the first session they were instructed to use a pointer to reproduce the total angular displacement after the motion (REPRODUCTION); in the second session they had to keep pointing towards a remote (15 m) memorised target during the motion (TRACKING). In REPRODUCTION subjects tended to overestimate their rotation angle by 28 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD). There was no systematic effect of the trajectory. Overestimation also occurred when subjects were required to rotate in darkness by 180 degrees (by controlling a joystick). In TRACKING there was virtually no overestimation (6 +/- 17%) and the movement of the pointer matched the dynamics of angular motion. We conclude that (a) the brain can separate and memorise the angular component of complex 2D motion; however, a large inter-individual variability in estimating its amplitude exists; (b) in the range of linear accelerations used in the study, no appreciable effect of otolith-canal perceptual interaction was shown; (c) angular displacements can be dynamically transformed into matched pointing movements; (d) overestimation seems to be typical of delayed judgements of angular displacement and of self-controlled rotations in place. This could be due to the characteristics of the physiological calibration of the vestibular input.

TI  - Curli fibers are highly conserved between Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with respect to operon structure and regulation.  
AB  - Mouse-virulent Salmonella typhimurium strains SR-11 and ATCC 14028-1s express curli fibers, thin aggregative fibers, at ambient temperature on plates as judged by Western blot analysis and electron microscopy. Concomitantly with curli expression, cells develop a rough and dry colony morphology and bind the dye Congo red (called the rdar morphotype). Cloning and characterization of the two divergently transcribed operons required for curli biogenesis, csgBA(C) and csgDEFG, from S. typhimurium SR-11 revealed the same gene order and flanking genes as in Escherichia coli. The divergence of the curli region between S. typhimurium and E. coli at the nucleotide level is above average (22.4%). However, a high level of conservation at the protein level, which ranged from 86% amino acid homology for the fiber subunit CsgA to 99% homology for the lipoprotein CsgG, implies functional constraints on the gene products. Consequently, S. typhimurium genes on low-copy-number plasmids were able to complement respective E. coli mutants, although not always to wild-type levels. rpoS and ompR are required for transcriptional activation of (at least) the csgD promoter.  The high degree of conservation at the protein level and the identical regulation patterns in E. coli and S. typhimurium suggest similar roles of curli fibers in the same ecological niche in the two species.

TI  - Properties of citric acid at the glass transition.  
AB  - To better understand the properties of citric acid when used in solid dosage forms as an acid-base buffer, we initiated a study of its properties in the amorphous state. Such a state often arises during processes such as lyophilization and wet granulation. In view of inconsistencies in the literature concerning the glass transition temperature, Tg, of citric acid in the dry and hydrated states, we measured the Tg of samples formed by a melt-quench cool sequence in a DSC. We also used DSC to measure Tg', the glass transition temperature of the maximally freeze-concentrated solution. It was shown that dry citric acid has a Tg of 11 degrees C, while that containing 8.6% water (equimolar) has a value of -25 degrees C. The Tg' of a frozen solution of citric acid is -53 degrees C. Measuring Tg for the dry and hydrated samples at various scanning rates allowed measurement of the activation energy for enthalpy relaxation at Tg and enabled estimation of the degree of fragility (or the strength parameter) for both samples. It was shown that citric acid is a fairly fragile liquid expected to exhibit non-Arrhenius dynamic behavior and that the presence of residual water at a level of 8.6% causes a decrease in fragility.

TI  - Immunohistochemical demonstration of MET overexpression in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and in hepatolithiasis.  
AB  - Expression of MET, the c-met-encoded receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, has not been investigated in proliferative biliary diseases of human liver, including hepatolithiasis and cholangiocarcinoma. Comparatively, we analyzed by immunohistochemistry the expression of MET in normal adult human livers (n = 20), normal postnatal preadult livers (n = 21), fetal livers (n = 36), hepatolithiatic livers (n = 32), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (n = 26). In normal adult livers, obvious MET immunoreactivity was not found in any cell types. In fetal liver, MET was weakly expressed in primitive biliary cells (ductal plate and immature bile ducts) and immature hepatocytes during 8 to 30 gestational weeks but was essentially negative thereafter. In hepatolithiasis, a condition of risk for cholangiocarcinoma development, MET was overexpressed in proliferated biliary cells in 26 of 32 cases (81%). In this nonneoplastic proliferative biliary condition, MET immunoreactivity was observed to be most prominent in the hyperplastic septal and large bile ducts of liver, and in the proliferated peribiliary glands associated with intrahepatic large bile ducts. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, MET overexpression in neoplastic biliary epithelium was observed in 15 of 26 cases (58%) and correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation, being highest in well-differentiated tumors and relatively low in poorly differentiated tumors. These data show for the first time that overexpression of MET is a common feature of hyperplastic and neoplastic biliary epithelial cells in human liver and suggest that MET/hepatocyte growth factor may be playing an important role in human biliary hyperplasia and in cholangiocarcinogenesis in vivo.

TI  - Dynamic cursor gain and tactual feedback in the capture of cursor movements.  
AB  - Recent research involving a trackball with force feedback has demonstrated that tactile feedback can enhance the acquisition of targets in graphical user interfaces in terms of movement times and errors. The present study seeks to explore the degree to which tactual feedback over a target, in contrast to changes in the display/control gain over the target, influences target acquisition performance. Tactual feedback over a target is felt as a pulling force towards the centre of a target, with a counterforce applied when moving out of the centre. Changes in the cursor gain can be used to create a cursor-catching effect by requiring more movement effort of the control device to leave than to enter the target centre, without increasing the total amount of effort to enter and leave the target area. User movement in entering a target is thus braked by the change in cursor gain. Results of an experiment indicated that target acquisition performance was generally higher in the tactual feedback condition, followed by cursor gain feedback, in comparison with no-cursor gain feedback. User interface design issues as related to gain feedback in visual interfaces and tactual feedback over targets are considered.

TI  - Association of tumor washout rates and accumulation of technetium-99m-MIBI with expression of P-glycoprotein in lung cancer [see comments]  
AB  - In a prospective study, we correlated the washout rates of 99mTc-sestamibi (MIBI) and the degree of MIBI accumulation with the expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in tumor tissues in a total of 46 patients with lung cancer. METHODS: All patients underwent early (30 min) and delayed (3 hr) MIBI imaging and bronchoscopic biopsy before initiation of chemo- or radiotherapy. The interval between biopsy and imaging varied between 2 and 10 days. All patients had radiologically detectable tumors. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin sections using a monoclonal antibody, JSB-1, developed against the internal epitope of Pgp. Normal tissue and tumor washout rates and tumor-to-background ratios were correlated with the level of Pgp expression. RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between tumor-to-background ratios and the density of Pgp (p = 0.001), whereas there was no appreciable correlation between tumor washout rates of MIBI and the level of Pgp expression (p = 0.414). CONCLUSION: The current data strongly suggest that, although the reduced ability for the tumors to accumulate MIBI correlates well with the increased levels of Pgp expression, tumor washout rates of MIBI do not correlate with the density of Pgp in tumor tissues. Our results also warrant additional research for correlating immunohistological and imaging findings with messenger RNA levels determined by polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuing medical education is essential to cope with the accelerated evolution of medical knowledge. AIM: To assess the feasibility of a distance medical education program prepared in a written format. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety physicians, aged 25 to 29 years old and with 1 to 4 years of medical practice, working mostly in rural locations, participated in the program. The sending of 10 issues with medical topics was programmed. The topics were selected according to the results of an survey done among physicians of the region. Each issue contained an evaluation that had to be returned to the authors. RESULTS: Eighty two physicians completed the program and 59 returned the evaluations. The mean obtained score in the cognitive evaluation was 80 +/- 6 points (range 68 to 97 points) of a scale from 0 to 100. The qualitative survey revealed a high degree of approval of the issue's format, contents and evaluation system. The favorable effect on patient's management and on the detection and control of chronic diseases was emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: This distance medical education program had a good receipt and compliance among physicians and contributed to continuing medical training.

TI  - The Caenorhabditis elegans SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-2 participates in signal transduction during oogenesis and vulval development.  
AB  - Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHPs) have been identified as either positive or negative regulators of signaling events downstream of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (R-PTKs). We describe here our characterization of ptp-2, a Caenorhabditis elegans gene that encodes a 668-amino-acid SHP. We isolated a recessive ptp-2 loss-of-function allele, op194, that lacks the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain by screening for transposon-mediated deletion mutations. Homozygous ptp-2(op194) hermaphrodites exhibit a completely penetrant zygotic semisterile/maternal effect lethal phenotype, characterized by the presence of abnormally large oocytes in the zygotic semisterile animals. These phenotypes indicate that PTP-2 activity is essential for proper oogenesis. Gain-of-function let-60 ras alleles rescued the defects associated with ptp-2(op194), suggesting that LET-60 Ras acts downstream of, or in parallel to, PTP-2 during oogenesis. Although ptp-2 function is not required for normal vulval development, ptp-2(op194) altered significantly the vulval phenotypes caused by mutations in several genes of the inductive signaling pathway. The penetrance of the multivulva phenotype caused by loss-of-function mutations in lin-15, and gain-of-function mutations in let-23 or let-60 ras, was reduced by ptp-2(op194). Moreover, ptp-2(op194) increased the penetrance of the vulvaless phenotype conferred by a weak loss-of-function sem-5 allele. Taken together, our genetic data positions PTP-2 activity downstream of LET-23 in the vulval induction signaling pathway. Although PTP-2 functions to transmit a requisite signal during oogenesis, PTP-2 function during C. elegans vulval cell differentiation appears to be directed at regulating the overall strength of the inductive signal, which may contribute to the quantitative differences in signaling required for the proper specification of the 1 degrees , 2 degrees , and 3 degrees vulval cell fates.

TI  - Profound disturbances of pre- and postsynaptic GABAB-receptor-mediated processes in region CA1 in a chronic model of temporal lobe epilepsy.  
AB  - 1. This report examines alterations in presynaptic and postsynaptic processes mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) receptors within hippocampal region CA1 in a model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Intracellular recordings were obtained in pyramidal cells from combined hippocampal/parahippocampal control slices and slices obtained > or = 1 mo after a period of self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus (SSLSE) induced by continuous hippocampal stimulation. 2. Monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were evoked by placement of the stimulating electrode in stratum pyramidale within 500 microns of the recording electrode in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. Control IPSPs exhibited early (GABAA-receptor-mediated) and late (GABAB-receptor-mediated) components. In contrast, post-SSLSE IPSPs displayed only a GABAA-receptor-mediated IPSP. Post-SSLSE IPSPs were completely eliminated by antagonists of the GABAA receptor (bicuculline methiodide and picrotoxin). In control tissue, GABAB receptor antagonists P-(3-aminopropyl)-P-diethoxymethyl-phosphinic acid (CGP 55845A), 3-N[1-(S)-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) ethyl]amino-2-(S)- hydroxypropyl-P-benzyl-phosphinic acid (CGP 35348), and 2-hydroxysaclofen eliminated the late component of the biphasic IPSP but had no discernible effect on IPSPs evoked in post-SSLSE CA1 pyramidal cells. 3. A paired pulse paradigm was employed to investigate the integrity of presynaptic GABAB-receptor-mediated inhibition of GABA release. To isolate pure GABAA-receptor-mediated responses, and thus facilitate comparison with post-SSLSE tissue, control neurons were penetrated with intracellular electrodes containing Cs2SO4/lidocaine, N-ethyl bromide (QX-314), and IPSPs were evoked employing the monosynaptic IPSP protocol. In controls, paired pulses [interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 70-1,500 ms] resulted in a diminution of the second early, GABAA-receptor-mediated chloride IPSP (IPSPA) relative to the first; maximum paired pulse depression (PPD) occurred at an IPI of 100 ms. GABAB receptor antagonists reduced PPD without affecting the amplitude of IPSPAs; the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen reduced the amplitude of both the first and second IPSPA and largely alleviated PPD. In contrast, no PPD was evident at any IPI in post-SSLSE neurons. Neither antagonists nor agonists of GABAB-receptor-mediated processes had an effect on either the degree of PPD or the amplitude of IPSPs. 4. To better approximate the pattern of CA1 pyramidal cell activation occurring during epileptiform activity. IPSPAs were evoked by trains of stimuli. In controls, mean monosynaptic IPSPA amplitude decreased by approximately 60% during a 3-Hz, 5-s train, with more than half the decline coming between the first and second IPSPs. In post-SSLSE, no significant IPSPA depression resulted from delivery of stimulus trains. Baclofen reduced the amplitude of control IPSPAs evoked during stimulus trains; both agonist and antagonists significantly lessened the degree of IPSP depression. These same agents altered neither IPSP amplitude nor the degree of use-dependent IPSP depression produced in post-SSLSE tissue during stimulus trains. 5. We conclude that a dysfunction of both presynaptic and postsynaptic GABAB-receptor-mediated processes occurs in hippocampal area CA1 in the post-SSLSE model of TLE. GABAB receptor agonists and antagonists had no effect on post-SSLSE CA1 pyramidal cell synaptic responses, whereas antagonists of the GABAA receptor completely eliminated IPSPs. Repetitive activation produced no use-dependent synaptic depression. The implications of these findings for the epileptogenic potential of post-SSLSE CA1 and the "dormant basket cell"

TI  - Characterization of the ATF/CREB site and its complex with GCN4.  
AB  - We have studied DNA minicircles containing the ATF/CREB binding site for GCN4 by using a combination of cyclization kinetics experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. Cyclization rates were determined with and without GCN4 for DNA constructs containing the ATF/CREB site separated from a phased A-tract multimer bend by a variable length phasing adaptor. The cyclization results show that GCN4 binding does not significantly change the conformation of the ATF/CREB site, which is intrinsically slightly bent toward the major groove. Monte Carlo simulations quantitate the ATF/CREB site structure as an 8 degrees bend toward the major groove in a coordinate frame near the center of the site. The ATF/CREB site is underwound by 53 degrees relative to the related AP-1 site DNA. The effect of GCN4 binding can be modeled either as a decrease in the local flexibility, corresponding to an estimated 60% increase in the persistence length for the 10-bp binding site, or possibly as a small decrease (1 degrees) in intrinsic bend angle. Our results agree with recent electrophoretic and crystallographic studies and demonstrate that cyclization and simulation can characterize subtle changes in DNA structure and flexibility.

TI  - Effect of vasospasm on heme oxygenases in a rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in glia throughout the rat brain without affecting heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2). However, the relationship between cerebral vasospasm and the expression of heme oxygenases after SAH is thus far unknown. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the effect of vasospasm on the expression of heme oxygenases in a rat model of SAH. METHODS: Endothelin, hemolysate, hemolysate saturated with carbon monoxide (CO-hemolysate), and saline were injected into the cisterna magna of adult rats. Angiography was repeated before each injection and 15 and 60 minutes and 24 hours after each injection. Immunocytochemistry for HO-1, HO-2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed 24 hours after the injection. RESULTS: A significant vasospasm occurred in the basilar artery after the injection of endothelin, hemolysate, and CO-hemolysate.  The degree of vasospasm was most prominent 15 minutes after each injection. There was no significant difference in the degree of vasospasm among injections. The HO-1 was induced exclusively in the glial cells throughout the brain after injection of hemolysate and CO-hemolysate; however, it was not induced by endothelin and saline. In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the HO-1-positive cells were also stained for GFAP, suggesting astrocytic glial cells. On the other hand, HO-2 immunoreactivity was abundant in neurons and was not affected by endothelin, hemolysate, CO-hemolysate, or saline. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that heme per se, rather than ischemia induced by vasospasm, plays a pivotal role in the expression of HO-1 in this rat model.

TI  - Evaluation of quantitative buffy coat analysis in the detection of canine Dirofilaria immitis infection: a model to determine its effectiveness in the diagnosis of human filariasis.  
AB  - Quantitative buffy coat (QBC) analysis has been reported to have a high degree of methodical sensitivity in the detection of human filariasis. This study was conducted to evaluate its usefulness in the diagnosis of filariasis using a Dirofilaria immitis/dog model. By necropsy of 244 stray dogs, 40.6% of the animals were found to harbor 1-58 worms of D. immitis (mean 6.5 +/- 8.4 worms/infected dog). The QBC analysis and thick blood smear (TBS) method detected microfilaremia in 31.6% and 21.3% of these dogs, respectively. The results of these two methods were highly correlated with the presence of bisexual worms in the dogs. The QBC analysis was more sensitive (55% versus 39%) and efficient (79% versus 72%) than the conventional TBS method. However, accurate speciation of the microfilariae was impossible using the QBC analysis. Although this technique is more sensitive, simpler, and less time-consuming and does not require as much skill or experience in comparison with the conventional TBS method, the failure in speciation of the parasites may limit its usefulness.

TI  - Trapezius transfer for shoulder paralysis. 6 patients with brachial plexus injuries followed for 1 year.  
AB  - We transferred the trapezius with its bone insertion to the proximal humerus in 6 patients for treatment of a paralytic shoulder secondary to traumatic lesions of the brachial plexus. After 1 year, the shoulder abduction was improved from average 13 degrees (0 degrees-30 degrees) preoperatively to 76 degrees (50 degrees-100 degrees) postoperatively, and the shoulder flexion from 18 degrees (0 degrees-40 degrees) to 78 degrees (45 degrees-110 degrees) postoperatively. All the patients were satisfied with the outcome. We consider that transfer of the trapezius in a paralytic shoulder after brachial plexus injury gives a better outcome than shoulder fusion.

TI  - Chromosomal polymorphism and adaptation to specific industrial environments of Saccharomyces strains.  
AB  - Several industrial Saccharomyces strains, including bakers', wine, brewers' and distillers' yeasts, have been characterized with regards to their DNA content, chromosomal polymorphism and homologies with the DNA of laboratory strains. Measurement of the DNA contents of cells suggested that most of the industrial yeasts were aneuploids. Polymorphisms in the electrophoretic chromosomal pattern were so large that each strain could be individually identified. However, no specific changes relating to a particular group were observed. Hybridization using different probes from laboratory strains was very strong in all cases, indicating that all industrial strains possess a high degree of DNA homology with laboratory yeasts. Probes URA3, CUP1, LEU2, TRP1, GAL4 or ADC1 demonstrated the presence of one or two bands, two especially in bakers' strains. Also, results indicate that all hybridized genes are located on the same chromosomes both in laboratory and industrial strains. Translocation from chromosome VIII to XVI seems to have occurred in a distillers' strain, judging by the location of the CUP1 probe. Finally, when the SUC2 probe is used, results indicate a very widespread presence of the SUC genes in only bakers' and molasses alcohol distillers' strains. This clearly suggests that amplification of SUC genes is an adaptive mechanism conferring better fitness upon the strains in their specific industrial conditions. The widespread presence of Ty1 and Ty2 elements as well as Y' subtelomeric sequences could account for the inter- and intrachromosomal changes detected.

TI  - Survival analysis with uncertain endpoints.  
AB  - In some survival analysis applications, the endpoint of interest has a degree of uncertainty associated with it. These events are typically classified by the investigator or by an endpoint committee as true or false according to some decision rule, and the analysis proceeds using only the true endpoints. This procedure has two drawbacks: The cut point for the decision rule is somewhat arbitrary, and the information contained in the level of certainty is lost. This paper introduces a modification of the Cox regression model that allows all potential endpoints to be included in the analysis along with the level of certainty of each. Simulation results show this procedure to considerably increase the power of the standard procedure in a wide range of situations.

TI  - Multifocal topographic visual evoked potential: improving objective detection of local visual field defects.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships between the pattern stimulation of different parts of the visual field (up to 25 degrees of eccentricity), the electrode position, and the cortical response to improve objective detection of local visual field defects. METHODS: The human visual evoked potential (VEP) was assessed using multifocal pseudorandomly alternated pattern stimuli that were cortically scaled in size. Monopolar and bipolar electrode positions were used. The visual field was investigated up to 26 degrees of eccentricity. Twelve normal subjects and seven subjects with visual field defects of different nature were studied. RESULTS: Although the monopolar response is heavily biased toward the lower hemifield, bipolar leads overlying the active occipital cortex (straddling the inion) demonstrate good signals from all areas of the visual field tested. The amplitude is almost equal for the averaged upper and lower hemifields, but the polarity is opposite, causing partial cancellation of the full-field VEP.  The degree of cancellation depends mainly on latency differences between the vertical hemifields. The bipolar VEP corresponded well with Humphrey visual field defects, and it showed a loss of signal in the scotoma area. CONCLUSIONS: The multifocal VEP demonstrates good correspondence with the topography of the visual field. Recording with occipital bipolar electrode placement is superior to standard monopolar recording. To avoid a full-field cancellation effect, a separate evaluation of upper and lower hemifields should be used for the best assessment of retinocortical pathways. This technique represents a significant step toward the possible application of the multifocal VEP to objective detection of local defects in the visual field.

TI  - Changes in carpal tunnel pressures following endoscopic carpal tunnel release: a cadaveric study.  
AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to determine the amount of tissue that must be sectioned to adequately decompress the median nerve during an endoscopic carpal tunnel release procedure. In 6 fresh cadaver forearms, 2 balloons were inserted into the carpal tunnel. The first balloon was filled with saline solution to cause an initial carpal intracanal pressure of 50 mmHg. Pressure measurements were recorded, using the second balloon, at various increments of the flexor retinaculum division at 3 wrist positions (neutral, 35 degrees ; flexion, 35 degrees extension). At all increments of sectioning, carpal tunnel pressures in the neutral wrist position were consistently lowest and the values in 35 degrees extension were greatest. At each wrist flexion/extension angle, the pressure statistically decreased during incremental division of the flexor retinaculum. Incomplete release of the transverse carpal ligament resulted in incomplete decompression in the canal. Sectioning the overlying aponeurosis caused a further significant decrease in intracanal pressure.

TI  - Effectiveness of ultrasonography in diagnosis of maxillary sinus disease: a prospective comparison with radiographic and sinusoscopic examinations.  
AB  - AIM: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in comparison to radiographic and sinusoscopic techniques of maxillary sinuses examinations in acute and chronic sinus inflammations. METHODS: Ninety diseased sinuses in 50 patients (32 male and 18 female) were examined radiographically, ultrasonographically, and sinusoscopically. Ultrasonography was performed with Sinuscan 102 Sinusprint with 3.0 MHz transducer frequency, with A-mode curve display and Bulk-display. Radiography was performed in occipitonasofrontal and occipitonasomental projection, and sinusoscopy by local anesthesia using an optic instrument under 0 degrees, 30 degrees, and 70 degrees. Statistical assessment of ultrasonography sensitivity and specificity in relation to radiographic and sinusoscopic techniques was carried out. The data were compared using McNemar's test for paired data. RESULTS: Negative ultrasonographic agreed with negative radiographic findings in 18 of 20 sinuses. When ultrasonographic findings revealed mucosal thickening, complete filling, polyp or cyst, the agreements with radiographic findings were 24/30, 21/25, and 11/15, respectively. Negative ultrasonography agreed with negative sinusoscopic findings in 17/20 sinuses. When ultrasonographic findings revealed mucosal thickening, complete filling, polyp or cyst of the maxillary sinuses, the agreements with sinusoscopic findings were 26/30, 23/25, and 13/15, respectively. In comparison to radiological findings, the sensitivity of ultrasonography was 0.93 and specificity 0.60, and in comparison to sinusoscopic examination, sensitivity of ultrasonography was 0.93 and specificity 0.74. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can be used as a diagnostic method in the early diagnosis of sinus diseases. Compared to radiographic and sinusoscopic findings, it shows a high agreement in negative and positive findings, i.e., a high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Urinary glycosylated, free and total pyridinoline and free and total deoxypyridinoline in diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Published data on bone metabolism in diabetes mellitus are conflicting. We have measured pyridinium crosslinks, biochemical markers of bone resorption, in order to evaluate bone resorption in diabetes mellitus. We also wished to investigate whether, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, pyridinoline is glycosylated to a greater extent in patients with diabetes mellitus. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This cross sectional study included 142 patients (64 males, 78 females) with insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM and NIDDM). These patients were compared to a healthy control group of 99 individuals (39 males and 60 females). MEASUREMENTS: Pyridinium crosslinks, glycosylated, free and total pyridinoline (gPYD, fPYD, tPYD) and free and total deoxypridinoline (fDPD, tDPD) were measured in a spot urine sample by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Urinary creatinine, albumin and glucose were also measured. RESULTS: In the diabetic group, values of urinary gPYD and tDYD were significantly lower than in controls. gPYD excretion was lowest in patients with severe glycosuria. Free pyridinium crosslinks, both fPYD and fDPD, were excreted to a significantly lower extent. The molar ratio of tPYD to tDPD was significantly increased in diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased excretion of tDPD suggests low bone resorption in IDDM and NIDDM. Pyridinoline is not glycosylated to a greater extent in diabetes mellitus and tends to be decreased in proportion to the degree of glycosuria. Excretion of gPYD, fPYD and fDPD is depressed in severe glycosuria. Diminshed degradation to the final products, fPYD and fDPD, might represent increased resistance to enzymatic activity or diminished enzymatic activity. The increased molar ratio tPYD/tDPD in urine suggests an increased ratio in bone collagen in diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Micromanipulation and cloning studies on buffalo oocytes and embryos using nucleus transfer.  
AB  - An investigation for testing the viability of production of cloned buffalo embryos through nucleus transfer has been made. Matured buffalo oocytes, after zona cutting to an extent of 60 degrees near polar body, were enucleated using a new approach. Instead of aspirating the cytoplasm contents in a pipette, the half of cytoplasm of oocyte was pushed out, thereby also taking away the nuclear material of the oocyte, leaving the demi-oocyte with the zona pellucida enucleated. The absence of fluorescence confirmed the success of the enucleating process. For enucleating, the oocytes which had intact plasma membrane were eligible for bisectioning. There was no significant difference in oocytes having intact membrane among grade I (33.9%) and grade II (31.4%) oocytes, whereas lower percentage of grade III oocytes had a very low percentage having intact plasma membranes (8.5%). The hours of maturation for 32, 37 and 42 did not influence the per cent oocytes which had intact membranes. All the bisected or demi-oocytes tested with fluorescence screening yielded successful enucleation in 88.2% demi-oocytes. The temporal effect of three maturation hours of 32, 37, and 42 hr; two electrical pulse numbers of 2 and 3 pulses and two magnitudes of electric pulses of 15 and 20 V were studied for their effect on the percentage of successful fusion of demi-oocyte blastomere complexes and the rate of complexes undergoing cleavages. The time period for which the oocytes were subjected to the process of maturation significantly affected the per cent fusions and per cent cleavage of the demi-oocyte blastomere complexes and 32 hr maturation yielded less fusions (38.5%) compared to maturation for 37 and 42 h (53.2 and 57.8%, respectively). The treatment of either 2 or 3 electrical pulse numbers resulted in significantly different fusion (45.6 and 54.1%) as well as cleavage rates (18.2 and 26.1%) of demi-oocyte-blastomere complexes electrofused. The treatment of two levels of magnitude of 15 and 20 V of an electric current resulted in similar per cent fusion (48.0 and 51.6%) and cleavage rates (21.0 and 23.2%). Fortified TCM with either 10 or 20% FBS for culturing freshly electrofused complexes for 1 hr did not differ significantly with respect to per cent complexes fused and cleaved, giving a fusion rate of 46.2 and 53.8% and cleavage rate of 21.2 and 23.2% for 10% and 20% FBS, respectively. Production of cloned embryos through the process of nuclear transfer has been accomplished. The successful cleavages of the nuclear transferred oocytes demonstrated the viability of enucleation procedures of the oocytes and technology implementation of electrofusion in buffalo oocytes.

TI  - Risk for hand eczema in employees with past or present atopic dermatitis.  
AB  - Persons with atopic dermatitis run a considerable risk of developing hand eczema when exposed to occupational agents that are a burden to the skin. This also pertains to those with a history of skin atopy in childhood. This review presents estimates of the risk of developing hand eczema and examines the evidence for an effect modification by skin atopy on exposure. Skin atopy at least doubles the effects of irritant exposure and, thus, doubles the risk in occupations where hand eczema is a common problem. On the basis of this evidence, guidelines for occupational counseling can be given. Further development of a scale indicating the degree of atopic skin diathesis should facilitate the targeting of this counseling toward specific high-risk groups.

TI  - Sublethal damage repair times for a late-responding tissue relevant to brachytherapy (and external-beam radiotherapy): implications for new brachytherapy protocols.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Data were analyzed from recent experiments with the end point of late rectal obstruction in rats, involving acute and various protracted radiation exposures. Because the end point is of direct relevance both for brachytherapy as well as external beam radiotherapy, the goal was to estimate the linear-quadratic (LQ) parameters alpha/beta and T1/2, which are of importance for designing improved protraction/fractionation schemes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data were fit to the LQ model, both in its standard form and in a form in which two different components of sublethal damage repair-fast and slow-are assumed. The design of the experiments was such that both slow and reasonably fast sublethal damage repair components should be separately estimated, if they were contributing to a significant degree. RESULTS: LQ parameter estimates were alpha/beta = 4.6 Gy [4.0, 5.5] and T1/2 = 70.2 min [59.1, 91.4]. Despite the experimental design facilitating detection of a rapid component of repair, no statistically robust evidence for a very fast repair component was found. CONCLUSIONS: The long estimated repair time for a late-responding normal-tissue end point with direct relevance to brachytherapy suggests a variety of possible brachytherapy protocols that may be more efficacious than continuous low dose rate irradiation. Just as a difference in alpha/beta ratios between early- and late-responding tissues are a central tenet in radiotherapy, so corresponding differences in T1/2 values have the potential to be exploited, particularly for brachytherapy.

TI  - Expression of growth factors, growth-inhibiting factors, and their receptors in invasive breast cancer. II: Correlations with proliferation and angiogenesis.  
AB  - Growth factors may play an important role in tumour growth and angiogenesis by their influence on tumour cell proliferation or their effect on neovascularization. The aim of the present study was to determine which of the growth factors, growth-inhibiting factors, and their receptors investigated in a previous study are correlated with proliferation and angiogenesis in invasive breast cancer, with emphasis on the impact of possible autocrine and paracrine loops. Five growth factors and their receptors: platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-AA) and PDGF alpha receptor (PDGF alpha R), PDGF-BB and PDGF beta receptor (PDGF beta R), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) and its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR; two growth-inhibiting factors: transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1) and TGF beta 2 and their receptor couple TGF beta R-I and TGF beta R-II; and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were stained in 45 cases of invasive breast cancer by standard immunohistochemistry on frozen sections. Staining in tumour cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells was scored as negative or positive. Proliferation was determined by assessment of the mitotic activity index (MAI) and the degree of angiogenesis was measure by counting the number of microvessels (microvessel density: MVD) in the most vascularized area of the tumour. bFGF and EGFR showed positive correlations with the MAI, while TGF beta 2 showed a negative correlation. Expression of bFGF, TGF alpha, TGF beta 2, and EGFR correlated positively with the MVD. Co-expression of the TGF alpha/EGFR growth factor/receptor combination showed a stronger correlation with the MAI and the MVD than EGFR or TGF alpha alone, and the TGF beta 2/TGF beta R-I/TGE beta R-II combination showed a positive correlation with the MVD. In conclusion, the expression of several growth factors, growth factor receptors and growth-inhibiting factors showed correlations with the rate of proliferation and the degree of angiogenesis in invasive breast cancer. Some growth factor/receptor combinations showed stronger correlations with proliferation and angiogenesis than the growth factor or receptor alone, pointing to the importance of possible auto- and paracrine loops for stimulation of proliferation and angiogenesis by growth factors and their receptors.

TI  - Louis Willems (1822-1907) and the immunization against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. An evaluation.  
AB  - Louis Willems's name is intimately linked with the history of prophylactic immunization in the nineteenth century. When he obtained his medical degree in 1849 contagious bovine pleuropneumonia or lung sickness was raging among the cattle population in most European countries. As the son of a cattle fattener Willems was confronted directly with the problem in his father's stables and decided to study the disease and to search for a remedy to combat it. The disease is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides and subspecies mycoides, but in the middle of the nineteenth century during the battle between the miasmatists and the contagionists, many had doubts about its contagiousness. Willems defended from the start the contagiousness of the disease and noticed that animals who had survived an infection did not contract it a second time. He demonstrated that inoculation of the serous fluid from the lungs or from the pleural cavity of affected animals into healthy cattle led to pronounced local reactions. When these inoculated animals later on came into contact with diseased cattle they were shown to be immune. In his first trials he inoculated at the base of the tail or around the nostrils but this led to very severe reactions and frequently to death. He then started inoculating at the tip of the tail with much better results. Most animals showed a more or less pronounced reaction at the inoculation site and about seven percent lost their tail partially or completely through necrosis, but the mortality remained very limited. The local reactions were caused by the etiological agent itself. The lesions in the connective tissue of the tail showed much resemblance to those in the interlobular septa of the lungs and contained strong accumulations of serous fluid. The tip of the tail was obviously a good choice; this was confirmed later by many authors and the procedure is still being used today in areas where the disease is still prevalent. Inoculation at other sites of the body such as the neck or the dewlap, led to very severe reactions often followed by death. Willems also demonstrated that local inoculation at the tip of the tail not only immunized the animals against infection via the respiratory tract resulting from contact with diseased animals, but also against a second inoculation in the tail, in the neck or elsewhere. Material harvested from the inoculation site in the tail (so-called secondary "virus") could also be used as inoculum. Animals who showed no reaction to the first inoculation received a second one after a few weeks. Immunization as a result of inoculation was proved repeatedly experimentally as well in Willem's lifetime, by himself and by his contemporaries, as later in more recent trials. Failures were usually attributable to inoculation of already infected animals or to the use of badly stored or purulent inocula. Inoculation during the incubation period did not provide protection. Willems' concepts about the mechanisms of immunity were understandably vague and ill-defined. He considered pleuropneumonia as an affection of the whole body with process in the lung in case of natural infection; following inoculation this process took place somewhere else and one created as it were a typical lung infection at another site of the body. Through the introduction of the "virus" a "dynamisation" of the whole body took place by which the blood and other organs became insensitive to reinfection. This explained why the inoculation protected not only the inoculation site, but the whole organism; Willems thought that the infection did not spread from inoculated to non-inoculated animals; this opinion was supported by some other workers in the field but opposed by others. The publication of his results created enormous interest in his country and abroad. In several countries commissions were created, trials were initiated a

TI  - Cross-linked growth hormone dimers have enhanced biological activity.  
AB  - In this study we have investigated the effect on the bioactivity of pituitary-derived human growth hormone (hGH) and recombinant bovine (b) GH after the addition of various concentrations of the water soluble cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC; 6.25-100 mg/ml). The biological activity of resulting cross-linked reactions were determined by its ability to promote incorporation of 35SO4(2-) into costal cartilage of hypopituitary Snell dwarf mice in vivo. Administration of EDC-treated hGH solutions resulted in a significant enhancement of hormone activity in vivo compared with non-cross-linked samples. A similar significant enhancement of bGH activity in vivo was also observed when solutions containing recombinant bGH were cross-linked using EDC. For both hGH and bGH the degree of enhancement appears to be dose-dependent for the concentration of EDC (6.25-100 mg/ml for hGH; 6.25-50 mg/ml for bGH) present in the cross-linking reactions. SDS-PAGE analysis of EDC cross-linked solutions containing hGH and bGH spiked with 125I-hGH and 125I-bGH respectively revealed that dimeric GH was the primary cross-linked component. Increasing the concentration of EDC in cross-linking reactions resulted in increased formation of dimeric hGH and bGH. There was a significant correlation between the amount of GH dimer present and the increase in biological activity, suggesting that GH dimers were responsible for the enhanced biological activity. This was confirmed by the enhanced biological activity of a purified preparation of EDC cross-linked dimeric hGH. In conclusion, covalently cross-linked GH dimers reported here have enhanced bioactivity in vivo. However, since naturally occurring GH dimers are known to have reduced biological activity, this work suggests that the structure of EDC cross-linked GH dimers differs fundamentally from that of native dimeric hGH.

TI  - Fatigue in ambulatory AIDS patients.  
AB  - Although preliminary reports indicate that fatigue is a common symptom of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, little empirical research has focused on its prevalence or characteristics among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We assessed the frequency of fatigue and its medical and psychological correlates, in a cross-sectional survey of ambulatory AIDS patients. Ambulatory patients with AIDS who participated in a study of quality life (N = 427) were classified into fatigue/no fatigue groups based on their responses to fatigue items on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and the AIDS physical symptom checklist. Self-report inventories were also administered to assess psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and overall quality of life. Medical information was elicited through clinical interview and review of medical chart. Fifty-four percent of the patients endorsed both of the fatigue items from the MSAS and the AIDS physical symptom checklists, and were classified as having fatigue. Women were significantly more likely to report fatigue than men (chi square = 5.28, df = 1, P < 0.03), and patients reporting homosexual contact as their transmission risk factor were significantly less likely to report fatigue than were patients reporting injection drug use or heterosexual contact (chi square = 5.13, df = 2, P < 0.03). The presence of fatigue was significantly associated with the number of current AIDS-related physical symptoms [t(425) = 8.00, P < 0.0001], current treatment for HIV-related medical disorders (chi square = 12.51, df = 1, P < 0.0001), anemia [t(174) = -2.35, P < 0.02], and pain (chi square = 36.36, df = 1 P < 0.0001). Patients with fatigue also had significantly poorer physical functioning ability [Karnofsky: t(422) = -6.27, P < 0.0001], as well as greater degree of overall psychological distress and lower quality of life [F(5,418) = 23.79, P < 0.0001], as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Functional Living Inventory for Cancer (modified for AIDS), and the MSAS Psychological Distress Subscale. Fatigue is a common symptom in ambulatory AIDS patients and is associated with significant physical and psychological morbidity.

TI  - [Hydroxyethyl starch--an interim report]  
AB  - Since the beginning of this century, a few biopolymers have been used as basic materials for volume substitution. Aside from gelatin and dextran, modified starch (hydroxyethyl starch, HES) is currently the first-choice means. Due to special manufacturing processes, different hydroxyethyl starches are now available. They have several different characteristics and produce different clinical effects. These clinical properties depend on the average molecular weight and the distribution of molecular weight as well as on the degree and pattern of substitution. The duration of volume effect, one of the most important parameters for the effectiveness of a volume substitute, depends to a large degree on the substitution. Elimination of HES from serum is delayed by a high degree of substitution and a high C2/C6 ratio of the substitution pattern. The molecular parameters of HES also influence other effects, such as cumulation in various organs and hemostasis. Critical reading of current HES literature shows that many questions still have to be answered. At the same time ways and means of optimizing differential volume substitution therapy and hemodilution therapy are emerging.

TI  - Relation between left ventricular function and oxidative stress in patients undergoing bypass surgery [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is related to the degree of myocardial oxidative stress during bypass surgery in man. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care centre. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: 31 patients (LVEF range was 20% to 68%) undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery with blood cardioplegic reperfusion were studied. Arterial and coronary sinus blood was collected before aortic cross clamping (T0) and at 0 (T1), 15 (T2), and 30 (T3) minutes after unclamping. Transmural left ventricular biopsies were also obtained from 15 patients at T0 and at T1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glutathione and adenine nucleotides were measured in myocardial biopsies, while coronary sinus-artery differences for glutathione, nucleotides, and products of lipid peroxidation were calculated from blood specimens. Creatine kinase (myocardial band; CK-MB) was measured in plasma at four and 12 hours after operation. RESULTS: Myocardial glutathione and adenine nucleotides were correlated (p < 0.02) with preoperative LVEF both at T0 (r = 0.909 and 0.672) and T1 (r = 0.603 and 0.605). Oxidised glutathione released from the heart during reperfusion was inversely correlated with LVEF (r = -0.448, -0.466, and -0461 at T1, T2, and T3, p < 0.01), while reduced glutathione (r = 0.519 and 0.640 at T1 and T2) and glutathione redox ratio (r = 0.647, 0.714, 0.645, and 0.702 at T0, T1, T2, and T3) showed a direct correlation (p < 0.01). Lipid peroxidation at T1 was negatively related to LVEF (r = -0.492). CK-MB was also negatively related to LVEF (r = -0.440 at 4 h and -0.462 at 12 h). CONCLUSIONS: The capacity to counterbalance oxidative burst following ischaemia and reperfusion appears to be related to the functional ability of the heart.

AB  - PURPOSE: A colleague requested PRK. The last time the patient was seen, no spectacles or contact lenses were worn. However, subjective refraction was -7.00 -5.50 x 165 degrees. The original Nidek nomogram would have suggested setting the laser at the actual refraction. Our algorithm adjustments suggested a 40% extra correction of cylinder would be required. The laser was therefore set to -3.50 -8.00 x 165 degrees aiming for a -1.00 -2.00 x 165 degrees outcome to allow for possible retreatment. METHODS: A 165 micron depth ablation was performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At 6 weeks after surgery, visual acuity was 0.63 unaided with a refraction of +1.50 -1.75 x 170 degrees on pred forte.

TI  - Immunoreactivity of porcine heart dihydrolipoamide acetyl- and succinyl-transferases (PDC-E2, OGDC-E2) with primary biliary cirrhosis sera: characterization of the autoantigenic region and effects of enzymatic delipoylation and relipoylation.  
AB  - Analysis of the primary structure of the lipoyl domain of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (PDC-E2) component of the porcine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reveals a high degree of homology with M2 antigen and human PDC-E2. The porcine PDC-E2 and the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (OGDC-E2) component of the porcine 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) were identified as mitochondrial autoantigen with sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Immunodominant regions (autoepitopes) on the porcine-PDC-E2 component have been mapped to two regions around Lys-46 (outer lipoyl domain) and Lys-173 (inner lipoyl domain), which contained covalently bound lipoic acid prosthetic group. When these lipoyl domains were cleaved at Asp-45 or Asp-172 with endoproteinase Asp-N, the autoantigenicities of the two domains completely disappeared; this suggested the requirement of Asp-45 or Asp-172 residues for the immunoreaction with PBC sera. In addition, a single 14-amino acid epitope peptide histidine-substituted at Asp-172 did not exhibit competitive inhibition of autoantigen binding. Fragmentation of lipoyl domain of the porcine PDC-E2 by limited proteolysis and BrCN-cleavage after alkylation resulted in rapid loss of autoantigenicity. Enzymatic delipoylation and relipoylation of the complexed and free PDC-E2 and OGDC-E2 components did not influence immunoreactivity with PBC sera.

TI  - Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II is a generalized defect of de novo GDP-fucose biosynthesis. Endothelial cell fucosylation is not required for neutrophil rolling on human nonlymphoid endothelium.  
AB  - Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LAD II) is a recently described syndrome and the two patients with this defect lack fucosylated glycoconjugates. These glycoconjugates include the selectin ligand, sialyl LewisX, and various fucosylated blood group antigens. To date, the molecular anomaly in these patients has not been identified. We localized the defect in LAD II to the de novo pathway of GDP-fucose biosynthesis, by inducing cell-surface expression of fucosylated glycoconjugates after exposure of lymphoblastoid cell lines from the LAD II patients to exogenous fucose. This defect is not restricted to hematopoietic cells, since similar findings were elicited in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and fibroblasts derived from an affected abortus. We have used these LAD II endothelial cells to examine the consequence of fucosylation of endothelial cells on the rolling of normal neutrophils in an in vitro assay. Neutrophil rolling on LPS-treated normal and LAD II HUVEC was inhibited by an E-selectin monoclonal antibody at both high and low shear rates. LAD II HUVEC lacking fucosylated glycoproteins supported leukocyte rolling to a similar degree as normal HUVEC or LAD II cells that were fucose-fed. At low shear rates, an L-selectin antibody inhibited neutrophil rolling to a similar degree whether the LAD II cells had been fucose-fed or not. These findings suggest that fucosylation of nonlymphoid endothelial cells does not play a major role in neutrophil rolling and that fucose is not a critical moiety on the L-selectin ligand(s) on endothelial cells of the systemic vasculature.

TI  - Lacustrine sockeye salmon return straight to their natal area from open water using both visual and olfactory cues.  
AB  - Mechanisms of the amazing ability of salmon to migrate a long distance from open water to natal streams for spawning are still unknown. Lacustrine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Lake Toya offers an excellent model system for studying the orientation mechanism in open water, because mature fish return to the natal area with a high degree of accuracy. First we examined the percentage of fish returning to the natal area after they were released 7 km south of the natal area. Forty percent of control male mature fish and 25% of the fish blinded by injection of a mixture of carbon toner and corn oil into the eyeball were captured in the natal area within 5 days. Forty-four percent of fish with brass rings (control) and 31% of fish with NdFe magnetic rings which interfere with the magnetic cue were captured in the natal area within 3 days. These experiments suggested that, although the number of blinded fish captured in the natal area was less than that of the controls, the difference was not statistically significant. In the fish captured in the natal area within 3 or 5 days, fish which found the natal area using their olfactory cue after random swimming for a long time and returned to that area may be included. Hence we tracked fish telemetrically using an ultrasonic tracking system, and found that mature males released at a long distance (3.6 or 6.8 km) from the natal area swam straight to the vicinity of the natal area. Interference of the magnetic cue by the attachment of a magnetic ring did not affect their direct return. Blockage of the visual cue caused them to move randomly. These data suggest that lacustrine sockeye salmon return straight to the vicinity of the natal area using their visual cue and finally reach the exact homing point using their olfactory cue.

TI  - The effects of focal and diffuse brain damage on strategy application: evidence from focal lesions, traumatic brain injury and normal aging.  
AB  - A new test of strategy application was designed to be relatively free of the constraints that limit the standard neuropsychological assessment of supervisory abilities. The validity of the test was assessed in 3 samples of participants with varying degrees of supervisory deficits and frontal systems dysfunction: focal frontal lesions, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and normal aging. Inefficient strategy application varied systematically across the 3 groups and was not due to extraneous factors such as forgetting the test instructions. Previous case studies have emphasized strategy application deficits in the face of normal neuropsychological test performance. In this study, it was shown that strategically impaired participants from a consecutive series can include those both with and without deficient neuropsychological test performance. When neuropsychological impairment was present, it was greatest on executive functioning tasks. Among participants with nonstrategic performance, there was evidence for a dissociation of knowledge from action. This finding was not specific to focal frontal lesions. A number of supervisory processes contributing to strategy application were identified. Exploratory analyses indicated differential effects of lesion location on these processes, especially inferior medial frontal and right hemisphere lesions. Overall, the results supported the use of unstructured tasks in the assessment of supervisory abilities.

TI  - Analysis of vascularity of human neurofibromas.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A common misperception is that the vascularity of a tumor can be determined by its gross appearance. Neurofibromas are grossly white in appearance. The degree of vascularity of neurofibromas has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of neovascularization of neurofibromas. METHODS: Neurofibromas from patients with neurofibromatosis-1 or spontaneous neurofibromas were stained with antibodies against von Willebrand factor (factor VIII-related antigen) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RESULTS: Neurofibromas, both spontaneous and congenital, exhibit a high degree of vascularity. In addition, perivascular cells in neurofibromas stain with antibodies to VEGF, an angiogenic factor. CONCLUSION: Neurofibromas, despite their gross appearance, are highly vascular. Their vascularity may be mediated, in part, through the angiogenic factor VEGF.

TI  - Anaemia in malaria control: a practical approach.  
AB  - Mortality from malarial anaemia and malarial infection in those who are already anaemic yet have some degree of compensation is now beginning to receive the attention it deserves. It is of particular concern in Africa and especially in young children and pregnant women. The asymptomatic parasitaemia remaining after poor response to full antimalarial treatment may lead to life-threatening anaemia; as drug-resistant strains of the malarial parasite proliferate this is becoming increasingly important. It is now possible to estimate haemoglobin levels, simply, cheaply, easily and safely, using a haemoglobin colour scale which is being developed by the World Health Organization. The potential and practical value of this scale in malaria-control programmes was demonstrated in a small, preliminary trial in 1995. Estimation of anaemia should become an additional parameter in the traditional malariometric survey. Haemoglobin concentrations should also be taken into consideration in the management of malaria patients at the primary-care level, particularly in deciding whether a patient should be referred to an appropriate treatment centre. The accurate prediction of clinical outcome of malaria and anaemia, and indication of the appropriate action (determined by a case-based reasoning device) should be possible in the near future.

TI  - An image registration scheme applied to verification of radiation therapy.  
AB  - The introduction of modern conformal radiation therapy techniques requires high geometric precision in treatment delivery which must be verified. For that purpose we have developed an automated system based on registration of portal and simulation (or planning) image pairs. The image registration is performed on anatomical features which are automatically extracted from the portal image. The portal image is then registered with a planning or simulation radiographic image which represents the geometric prescription for the treatment, using an optimized version of the chamfer matching algorithm. Subsequently, the magnitude of the radiation field displacement during treatment is measured by registering the prescribed and treated field boundaries. Algorithms based on chamfer matching and polygon matching have been used for the field boundary registration. Performance of the entire scheme was evaluated on a series of 15 portal images of a pelvic phantom representing various known degrees of the radiation field displacement. The measurements of the radiation field displacements performed by the automated system proved very reliable and after correction for systematic bias agreed to within 1.5 mm or 1 degree with the displacements applied. Second test series involved comparisons between the automated registrations and those performed manually/visually by an experienced human observer, on 31 portal images acquired during treatments of 18 pelvic patients. These tests showed close agreement (in 80% of cases discrepancies were smaller than 1.5 mm or 1.5 degrees) between the automated scheme and the human observer. It is concluded that the developed scheme would be suitable for online geometric verification of radiation therapy treatments.

TI  - High-speed, three-dimensional kinematic analysis of the normal wrist.  
AB  - Carpal kinematics during a wrist flexion/extension motion using high-speed videodata acquisition was investigated. A cadaver forearm was stabilized, allowing unconstrained excursion of the wrist for passive range of motion (ROM). The extensor and flexor pairs of the wrist were looped together and a 1-lb weight was attached to each pair, simulating synergistic muscle tension. Capitate/radius and third metacarpal/radius angles were calculated to determine which measurement would be best for determining global wrist angle. The average difference in capitate/radius and third metacarpal/radius angles at each respective flexion/extension wrist angle for all wrists was 1.1 degrees +/- 1.6 degrees (the maximum difference was 4 degrees). Hence, the capitate-third metacarpal joint can be considered rigid. Capitate/lunate motion as described by capitate-radius Euler angles ranged from -16.9 to 23.5 with total capitate/lunate motion of 40.5 (35%) in the 114 degrees total global wrist ROM measured. Radius/lunate motion as described by lunate-radius angle ranged from -8.2 to 48.4 with total radius/lunate motion of 56.5 (49%) in the 114 degrees total global wrist ROM measured. During global wrist motion, the radiolunate joint contributes more motion in flexion than the capitolunate joint and the capitolunate joint contributes more motion in extension than the radiolunate joint. The instantaneous screw axes (ISAs) were calculated for each third metacarpal position with respect to the radius. The average distance difference between ISAs for the 4 wrists tested was -1.23 +/- 14.97 pixels. The maximum distance was 56.51 pixels and the minimum was -24.09 pixels. This new combination of motion analysis and 3-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography images affords a high-speed, dynamic analysis of kinematics. It shows that during wrist flexion/extension, normal carpal kinematics does not have an ISA fixed in or limited to the capitate. In addition, the ISA data provide evidence that translational motion is a real and measurable component of normal carpal motion. These findings alter the understanding of carpal kinematics obtained from the results of previous studies which suggested that the center of rotation was fixed in the capitate.

TI  - Correlation between the drinkability of beer and gastric emptying.  
AB  - A subjective evaluation of beer drinkability and the degree of stomach fullness were found to correlate with the relaxed cross-sectional area of the pylorus antrum measured by real-time ultrasonography. Five kinds of beer with a different malt/adjuncts ratio and degree of attenuation were used. Each beer was given to 9 healthy volunteers at the rate of 3 ml/kg/15 min, and they each recorded the degree of stomach fullness, desire to drink and tastiness every 30 min. With increasing volume drunk, the degree of tastiness and desire to drink were lowered, and the degree of stomach fullness raised. The relaxed cross-sectional area of the pylorus antrum measured by an ultrasonic image analyzer every 30 min was highly correlated with the degree of stomach fullness, tastiness of the beer, and desire to drink (p = 0.0021, < 0.0001, 0.001). The beer giving the lowest degree of stomach fullness was appraised to be tasty and highly drinkable. These findings suggest that the rate of gastric emptying is one of the factors determining the drinkability of beer, and that measurement of the relaxed cross-sectional area of the pylorus antrum is useful to evaluate stomach fullness during beer drinking.

AB  - The original reason for using the German "Habilitation" degree to mean that a candidade had qualified and could conduct research and teach at a university is no longer really valid, as this is being threatened by its importance to further careers. Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed. In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system. They differed dramatically. Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval. Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty. Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points. A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002). Even if scoring systems are ambiguous and unfair, our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the Habilitation degree. Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.

This structure, which connects the head of the virus with the tail and plays a central role in prohead assembly and DNA packaging and translocation, is formed by 12 subunits of the p10 protein and has a molecular weight of 430 kDa. The connector structure was proteolysed with endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus V8, which removes 13 and 18 amino acids from the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the p10 protein, respectively. Two crystal forms were grown from drops containing an alcohol solution and paraffin oil.

TI  - Evaluation of X-ray beam angulation for successful twin canal identification in mandibular incisors.  
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the most effective horizontal beam angulation for the diagnosis of twin canals in mandibular incisors. Two hundred extracted mandibular incisor teeth, in groups of four, were aligned in the form of a lower dental arch and radiographed using a beam alignment device at 10 degrees intervals between 0 degree and 50 degrees from both right and left sides. Five observers with varying degrees of experience were asked to assess the number of canals in each of the four teeth from these radiographs. A further radiograph of each individual tooth was taken at 90 degrees through the mesio-distal plane to identify the number of twin canals present. A random sample of 10% of the radiographs were viewed for a second time 3 months later to assess intra-observer variation. The 20 degrees right and 30 degrees left horizontal beam angulations showed significantly more accurate diagnosis of twin canals than the ortho-radial view (0 degree) by all five observers. Analysis of the inter-observer results suggests that the experienced viewers were no better but more consistent at identifying twin canals in mandibular incisors.

TI  - Objective roentgenologic measurements of the influence of ankle braces on pathologic joint mobility. A comparison of 9 braces.  
AB  - The stabilizing effect of external support (taping and nine different ankle braces) was tested in a total of 220 functionally unstable ankles. A standard surface EMG controlled stress Roentgen test protocol was used, measuring talar tilt (TT) without support and with tape bandage or brace. Different levels of TT restraining by external support could be identified. Tape bandage and two braces had a highly significant influence on the talar tilt. The mean TT without support was decreased by using from 13.4 degrees to 4.9 degrees, by using one brace to 4.8 degrees and by using another brace to 5.9 degrees. These two braces are effective for protection during functional treatment. A classification into three grades of effectiveness is proposed. It is concluded that the stabilizing influence offered by bandages and braces should be measured before using the external support as a treatment device for acute ankle sprain and as a reliable protection against sprain injuries in daily living and sports.

TI  - Feeding ecology of the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) in northern Belize.  
AB  - We studied the feeding ecology of the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) from March 1994 to April 1995 in the Community Baboon Sanctuary in northern Belize, Central America. Activity and diet composition were recorded using continuous focal animal sampling. Diet composition was compared with the relative abundance of plant parts eaten by the howlers within the study site. The study animals spent an average of 24.4% of their time feeding, 61.9% resting, and approximately 9.8% traveling. In contrast to previously published reports on A. pigra, we found the diet composition to be similar to that of other Alouatta species (conforming to the folivore/frugivore profile), with 41% of feeding time spent eating fruit, 45% foliage, and 11% flowers. This contrast may indicate a wide degree of dietary flexibility that allows A. pigra to inhabit a variety of habitat types. We suggest that a high level of resource abundance throughout the year makes the Community Baboon Sanctuary excellent habitat for Alouatta pigra.

TI  - Is antihypertensive treatment the same for NIDDM and IDDM patients?  
AB  - The prevalence of abnormally elevated albumin excretion rate (> 30 mg/24 h) is approximately 40% in insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients. Diabetes has become the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in the US, Japan and Europe. Approximately 90% of the direct and indirect cost of caring for diabetic patients are spent on the complications of diabetes. Identification of patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy is possible by screening for microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h). Elevated urinary albumin excretion rate indicates a substantially increased mortality risk in diabetic patients. Randomised controlled trials in normotensive IDDM and NIDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria indicate that ACE inhibitors diminish urinary albumin excretion rate, postpone it and may even prevent progression to clinical overt nephropathy. These findings indicate that screening and intervention programs are likely to have life saving effects and lead to considerable economic savings. Systemic blood pressure elevation to a hypertensive level is an early and frequent phenomenon in diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, nocturnal blood pressure elevation (non-dippers) occurs more frequently in patients with nephropathy. Systemic blood pressure elevation and to a lesser degree albuminuria accelerate the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Effective blood pressure reduction with non-ACE-inhibitors and/or ACE-inhibitors frequently in combination with diuretics: (a) reduces albuminuria; (b) delays the progression of nephropathy; (c) postpones renal insufficiency; and (d) improves survival in IDDM and NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy. A specific renal protective effect of ACE-inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy has been demonstrated in IDDM patients with moderately reduced kidney function (s-creatinine > 133 mumol/l) while the data conflict with NIDDM patients. Antihypertensive treatment for diabetic nephropathy simultaneously extends life and saves money. Finally, reduced risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events have been demonstrated when diabetic patients with isolated systolic hypertension are treated with blood pressure lowering agents. Absolute risk reduction with active treatment compared to placebo was twice as great for the diabetic versus non-diabetic patients (101/1000 versus 51/1000 randomised participants at the 5-year follow-up), reflecting the higher risk of diabetic patients. In conclusion, early detection and aggressive treatment of arterial hypertension with ACE-inhibitors, long acting calcium antagonist and low dose diuretics as first line drugs are highly warranted in diabetic patients with or without diabetic renal disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify changes in the serum, nerve, and urinary levels of 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) in rats on coadministration with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetone (AC), and toluene (TO). METHOD: 2,5-HD alone or combined with MEK, AC, and TO was injected subcutaneously into a total of 306 male Wistar rats. The rats were divided as follows into 7 groups: (1) 2.6 mmol/kg 2,5-HD alone (HD) and (2) 2.6 mmol/ kg 2,5-HD combined with 2.6 mmol/kg MEK (HD + MEK), (3) with 2.6 mmol/kg AC (HD + AC), (4) with 2.6 mmol/kg TO (HD + TO), (5) with 13.0 mmol/kg MEK (HD + 5MEK), (6) with 13.0 mmol/kg AC (HD + 5AC), and (7) with 13.0 mmol/kg TO (HD + 5TO). 2,5-HD concentrations in the serum, sciatic nerve, and urine of rats were determined within 16 h of the injections and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. RESULTS: It was observed that (1) the 2,5-HD concentration and AUC value (area under concentration versus time curve) determined in the serum and nerve increased significantly in the cotreated groups as compared with the HD group; (2) the effect MEK had in elevating the 2,5-HD concentration and AUC in the serum and nerve was stronger than that of AC, and the effect AC had was stronger than that of TO; (3) a. dose increase from 2.6 to 13.0 mmol/kg for MEK and AC induced further increases in the 2,5-HD concentration and AUC determined in the serum and nerve; (4) elimination constants recorded for 2,5-HD (Ke) from the serum and nerve decreased in all the cotreated groups, and the degree of the decrease correlated inversely with the elevation in 2,5-HD concentration and AUC in the serum and nerve; and (5) urinary 2,5-HD concentrations measured in the 13.0-mmol/kg cotreated groups increased in parallel with the elevation in serum 2,5-HD concentrations. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of 2,5-HD with MEK, AC, or TO can increase the concentration and AUC of 2,5-HD in serum and the sciatic nerve, and these increases can be further enhanced by an increase in the concomitant doses of MEK and AC.

All compounds were tested on bovine brain mitochondria preparation containing flavin-monoamine oxidases and on purified bovine serum amine oxidases, taken as a model of trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone-copper-containing amine oxidases. The 1,3,5-triphenyl-4,5-dihydro-(1H)-pyrazole derivatives showed a good inhibitory activity and belonged to the third generation of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and bovine serum amine oxidase inhibitors which have the advantage of acting through a reversible mode.

TI  - Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder: an open study of 40 cases treated by joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection and immediate physical therapy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection then by high-intensity physical therapy and use of an abduction splint in an open study of 40 patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. METHODS: Patients were evaluated on D0, D5 (i.e., before discharge) and D30 for pain severity assessed using a four-point scale (0-3) and for passive ranges of abduction, internal rotation and external rotation of the shoulder. RESULTS: Mean pain severity improved significantly from 2.18 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) on D0 to 1.74 +/- 0.5 on D5 (P: 0.01) and 0.92 +/- 0.5 on D30 (P: 0.02). Passive range of abduction increased significantly from 44.8 degrees +/- 1.54 degrees on D0 to 68 degrees +/- 15 degrees on D5 (P: 0.05), whereas the difference between D5 and D30 (71 degrees +/- 13 degrees) was not significant (P: 0.8). Similarly, passive range of external rotation increased significantly from 4.3 degrees +/- 0.6 degree on D0 to 13.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degree on D5 (P = 0.04) and showed a nonsignificant increase from D5 to D30 (17 degrees +/- 13 degrees, P: 0.2). CONCLUSION: Joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection then by high-intensity physical therapy significantly improved pain and passive range of motion within the first five days, and these gains were sustained after one month.

AB  - Twenty-one adult dry-bone sacral specimens were used to quantitatively determine the location of the sacral pedicle, foramina, and ala on the lateral radiographic view of the sacrum. The anterior and posterior sacral foramina from S1 to S3, the midlines of the anterior sacrum and cephalad border of the S1 vertebral body, and the lateral limit of the lateral sacral mass were outlined with wires. A lateral radiograph was taken, and measurements were made directly from the radiograph. The average sacral pedicle height for both male and female specimens was approximately 20 mm for S1, 12 mm for S2, and 7 mm for S3. The sacral foramina height averaged approximately 13 mm for S1 and S2, and 10 mm for S3. The average ala and S1 body-ala angles were 88 degrees and 35 degrees. The distance from the ala tip to the anterior aspect of the sacrum averaged 12 mm, and the average anterior height of the S1 vertebral body above the ala was 11 mm. These measurements, in conjunction with inlet and outlet radiographs, may aid in the recognition of the vital structures of the sacrum on the lateral radiographic view and enhance the safety of dorsal sacral screw placement.

TI  - The replicative impairment of Vif- mutants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 correlates with an overall defect in viral DNA synthesis.  
AB  - The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the infectivity of virions produced by non-permissive cells. The primary replicative defect of Vif particles involves either synthesis or stability of viral DNA, but the mechanism of this defect is unknown. Here, we report the results of a detailed analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis by isogenic Vif- mutants produced by different chronically infected H9 clones, which exhibit different degrees of impairment in their replicative capacity. We found that the degree of impairment of DNA synthesis by the mutant particles always correlated with the degree of their loss of infectivity. This impairment appears to be global, with a defect increasing along with synthesis of longer viral DNA species. We conclude that the primary replicative defect of Vif- virus involves the capacity of the reverse transcription complex of HIV-1 to efficiently elongate viral DNA, resulting in an inability to produce full-length viral DNA genomes.

TI  - [Neutralizing capacity of ++antiophidic sera against the venom of Bothrops moojeni (lance-headed viper)]  
AB  - In the production of current therapeutic antisera used in Argentina for Bothrops snakebite, the Bothrops moojeni venom is not used as immunogen, since this snake is not considered a serious public health problem. Accidents caused by this species have not been reported in this country even though Bothrops moojeni is not unfrequent in some regions of Misiones.  Despite the high degree of immunological cross reactivity found among the Crotalinae venoms and, in this particular case, among the venoms from the Bothrops Genus, there exists a significant intraspecific variation in venom composition, particularly in specimens arising from different geographic regions. In this study, the antivenoms prepared at the Instituto Nacional de Produccion de Biologicos A.N.L.I.S. Dr. Carlos G. Malbran have been tested for their immunochemical cross reactivity and neutralizing ability of enzymatic and toxic activities of venom from Argentinian specimens of Bothrops moojeni from Misiones. Immunological cross-reactivity was tested by double-immunoprecipitation, immunoelectrophoresis, Western-blot and ELISA. Neutralizing ability of antivenoms against proteolytic, indirect hemolytic activity, procoagulant activity, he-morrhagic activity and necrotizing activity. The Lethal Dose 50 was 1.5 mg/kg body weight; this value is located in the range to those obtained with the venom from Brazilian specimens. It was observed that all the antivenoms exhibited a strong immunochemical cross reactivity and that they were able to neutralize in different degree both, enzymatic and toxic activities of B. moojeni venom. From these results, it can be assumed that the antivenom tested could be employed successfully in cases of B. moojeni snakebites.

TI  - Inheritance of static and dynamic arm strength and some of its determinants.  
AB  - Maximal static, eccentric and concentric torques and arm components estimated by anthropometry and measured by computed tomography were evaluated in 25 male monozygotic twins and 16 dizygotic twins (22.4 +/- 3.7 years). The importance of genetic and environmental factors in the observed variation in these measurements was estimated by genetic model-fitting techniques. In this sample of young adult male twins, genetic factors were significant in most of the strength measurements, arm muscle components and muscle activation variables. The contribution of genetic factors in strength measures depended on the angle, contraction type and to some extent on contraction velocity. For isometric strength, angle-specificity in genetic and environmental variation could be attributed to the degree of variability in muscle activation and performance discomfort at each specific angle, with the highest unique environmental impact at extreme angles. The high genetic contribution at 170 degrees, but not at 50 degrees, possibly expressed different contributions of genetic factors in the muscle-length factor and moment arm in torques at both angles. The importance of genetic factors in eccentric arm flexor strength (62-82%) was larger than for concentric flexion (29-65%), as the pattern of genetic determination followed the torque-velocity curve. Genetic variations in contractile and elastic components, contributing differently to eccentric and concentric torques, together with velocity-dependent actin-myosin binding factors, could account for the observed differences. The broad heritability was very high for all anthropometric and arm cross-sectional area measurements (> 85%) and common environmental factors were only significant for anthropometrically estimated mid-arm muscle tissue are (48%). Heritability estimates of different arm muscularity measurements were comparable.

TI  - Dental and skeletal changes after intraoral molar distalization with sectional jig assembly.  
AB  - The present study was conducted on 10 subjects to evaluate dental and skeletal changes after intraoral molar distalization. The maxillary molars were distalized with a sectional jig assembly. Sentalloy open coil springs were used to exert 150 gm of force for a period of 12 weeks. A modified Nance appliance was the main source of anchorage. The pre- and postdistalization records included dental study casts, clinical photographs, and cephalograms. A total of 665 readings recorded from lateral cephalograms and dental casts were subjected to statistical analysis. The mean distal movement of the first molar was 2.78 mm, which was highly significant (o < 0.001). It moved distally at the rate of 0.86 mm/month. There was clinically some distal tipping (3.50 degrees) and distopalatal rotation (2.40 degrees). These changes were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The second molars accompanied the first molars and moved distally by nearly the same amount. There was 1.00 mm increase in the overjet and 2.60 degrees mesial tip of second premolar. The changes in the facial skeleton and dentition bases were minimal and statistically not significant. However, there was clockwise rotation of the mandible of 1.30 degrees that was statistically significant. This was the result of molar extrusion (1.60 mm).

AB  - The effects of tissue damage associated with invasive pO2 measurements on radiation sensitivity were investigated using a xenografted squamous cell carcinoma model. For the tumour cure experiments, single dose irradiations were given following different regimens of polarographic pO2 measurements associated with different degrees of mechanical tissue damage. With a dose of 32 Gy, 57% of animals were cured. Following 3 tracks of needle measurements, 73% of tumours were locally controlled, and 75% were cured after 8 needle tracks. The polarographic measurements gave virtually identical oxygenation data for recurrent or cured tumours (both median pO2 1.0 mmHg), respectively. There was thus no evidence of decreased radiosensitivity associated with tissue damage after invasive pO2 measurements. The pre-therapeutic oxygenation status gave no evidence for a prediction of radiation response on an individual basis.

The mean visual field defect was calculated separately for the central 26 degrees x 34 degrees covered by the PERG stimulus (MDc) and the more peripheral area (MDp) surrounding the stimulus. Deeper field loss was correlated with a reduced pattern electroretinogram amplitude (p < 0.01 for both MDp and MDc), indicating that the pattern electroretinogram deteriorates as glaucoma advances. If the analysis was confined to those 18 eyes (16 patients) that had no field defect within the area covered by the PERG stimulus (normal MDc but abnormal MDp), 13 of these had an abnormal PERG amplitude (p < 0.001). The results suggest that the PERG can reveal impairment of ganglion cell function that is not detected by conventional perimetry.

TI  - Cytokine evaluation in throat infections.  
AB  - Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes. In throat infections, intracellular inflammatory cytokines have been detected from the sites of inflammation. The present study aimed to evaluate serum cytokine levels of patients with throat infections and correlate them to the inflammatory parameters and type of inflammation. Significantly higher inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin [IL]-6 > 7 pg/mL, IL-1 > 1 beta pg/mL, tumor necrosis factor alpha > 1 pg/mL) were detected in most of the patients as opposed to healthy controls. Clinical parameters of infection (fever > 38 degrees C, leukocytosis > 11,000 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, polymorphonuclear neutrophils > 75%) were significantly correlated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines: mainly IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and to a lesser degree with IL-1 beta. No correlation, however, was found between the type of inflammation and cytokine levels. The present study indicates a role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of throat infections and the need for an anti-inflammatory and anticytokine therapeutic approach.

AB  - The primary objective of the present study was to compare the effect of a neoprene sleeve on knee joint position sense during a sitting open kinetic chain test and a supine closed kinetic chain test. Young (24 +/- 2 years old), healthy subjects (18 men and 18 women) performed knee joint angle replication tests during open kinetic chain knee extension (sitting) and closed kinetic chain leg press (supine with an axial load of 15% body weight) before and after application of a neoprene sleeve over the dominant knee. The improvement in ability to replicate joint angles after application of the sleeve (sleeve effect) was significantly less during the supine closed kinetic chain test (0.3 degree +/- 1.4 degrees) than during the sitting open kinetic chain test (1.2 degrees +/- 1.1 degrees). The sleeve effect was inversely related to subjects' performance without the sleeve during both the sitting open kinetic chain and supine closed kinetic chain tests, suggesting that some people may derive greater benefit from the sleeve than others. Although the sleeve effects were small, particularly during the supine closed kinetic chain test, 72% of subjects felt that the sleeve improved their overall test performance. Future research is needed to establish the functional relevance of the small sleeve effects observed and to identify the characteristics of people who might derive greatest benefit from sleeve use.

TI  - The effect of temperature on the elastic responses to longitudinal torsion of rectangular nickel titanium archwires.  
AB  - To investigate responses to longitudinal torsion and the effect of temperature on the torsional stiffness of superelastic nickel titanium archwires, eight batches of rectangular wires were tested at 18, 27, 37, and 40 degrees C ambient temperature. The wires were twisted 25 degrees and studied in deactivation. The resulting torque-twist diagrams show that only half the wires had discernible deactivation plateaus at body temperature. The plateaus were generally narrow (1 to 3 degrees) and started at 20 to 23 degrees of torsional twist. The clinical significance of these deactivation plateaus is debatable. Only one wire had a well-defined plateau that was fairly wide (6 degrees) and started at a lower level of twist (17 degrees). The wires without plateaus when deactivated from 25 degrees of twist were retested at body temperature. All exhibited deactivation plateaus subsequent to activating twists of 45 and 60 degrees, and the plateaus became more distinct as the degree of prior activation increased. This indicates that the stress imparted on the alloys by 25 degrees of activating twist is insufficient to induce martensitic transformation at body temperature. As prescriptions advocate bracket pretorque of less than 25 degrees for a maxillary central incisor, the clinical relevance of alloys requiring large activations before they demonstrate deactivation plateaus is questionable. Half the wires tested were markedly influenced by ambient temperature changes; the other half were relatively insensitive to temperature. Responsiveness to thermal stimuli seemed closely related to superelastic tendency.

TI  - Radiofrequency modification of the atrioventricular node in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation: comparison between anterior and posterior approaches.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We compared, in a prospective and randomized fashion with a cross-over design, the anterior and posterior approaches to radiofrequency (RF) modification of the AV node in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive first an anterior (group I) or posterior (group II) approach for RF modification of AV nodal conduction. Patients who did not fill the endpoint ventricular rate (< 90 beats/min) were crossed over to the alternative approach. After the anterior approach in group I patients, mean ventricular rate was significantly lower than in group II patients after the posterior approach (79.6 +/- 18.8 beats/min vs 110.8 +/- 16.2 beats/min, P < 0.001). In group I, 14 (82%) of 17 patients fulfilled the endpoint, 1 (6%) had complete AV block, and 2 (12%) were crossed over to the posterior approach fulfilling the endpoint. In group II, 4 (25%) of 16 patients fulfilled the endpoint. No transient or permanent high-degree AV block was observed. Among the 12 patients who were crossed over to the anterior approach, 8 fulfilled the endpoint, whereas 4 had permanent high-degree AV block. RF ablation carried out only in the anterior region was safer than a stepwise approach (6% vs 33% incidence of AV block), even though the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Posterior AV nodal modification is less effective but safer than anterior AV nodal modification. However, to reduce the incidence of AV block, the anterior approach is preferable to a stepwise approach from the posterior to the anterior zone.

TI  - Differential effect of 2-aminoethyl-isothiourea, an inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, on microvascular blood flow and organ injury in models of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion and endotoxemia.  
AB  - The vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the regulation of systemic blood pressure and local organ blood flow. Inhibitors of the constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells (eNOS), e.g., Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), aggravated liver injury in a variety of models. On the other hand, inhibitors of the inducible NOS (iNOS), e.g., 2-aminoethyl-isothiourea (AET), were found to be beneficial during endotoxemia. The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of AET compared with L-NAME on liver microvascular blood flow and injury in more complex models with multiple insults, i.e., ischemia (20 min)-reperfusion (8 h) in combination with .5 mg/kg endotoxin (IRE). Male Fisher rats were treated with 10 mg/kg AET or L-NAME and subjected to IRE. At 8 h, liver injury (plasma ALT: 1320+/-164 U/L) was significantly increased in AET-treated (5,018+/-1,379 U/L) and L-NAME-treated groups (2,429+/-228 U/L). Each inhibitor attenuated microvascular blood flow (assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry) to a similar degree. In striking contrast, AET completely reversed the endotoxin-induced impairment of the microvascular blood flow and significantly protected against an endotoxin-induced liver injury (plasma ALT: 3,007+/-268 U/L (ET); 460+/-39 U/L (ET+AET)). Infusion of endothelin-1 reduced microvascular blood flow by 50-60% and caused liver injury. Our data demonstrated that an inhibitor of eNOS (L-NAME) has a consistent detrimental effect on liver injury during ischemia-reperfusion and endotoxemia mainly because it can cause additional ischemia by reducing the microvascular blood flow. However, selective inhibitors of iNOS (AET) can impair hepatic blood flow and aggravate the injury or improve blood flow and attenuate organ injury depending on the experimental model. These results suggest that iNOS inhibitors may not be universally beneficial and should be tested in a variety of experimental models of sepsis/endotoxemia before used in clinical settings.

TI  - Administration of antenatal glucocorticoids prevents pulmonary artery structural changes in nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia in rats.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal administration of dexamethasone has any effect on pulmonary vasculature in nitrofen-induced experimental congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in a rat model. METHODS: A CDH model was induced in pregnant rats after administration of 100 mg nitrofen on day 9.5 of gestation. Antenatal dexamethasone, 0.25 mg/kg was given intraperitoneally on day 18.5 and 19.5 of gestation. The fetuses were divided into three groups: group I (n = 10), normal controls; group II (n = 10), nitrofen-induced CDH; group III (n = 10), nitrofen-induced CDH with maternal antenatal dexamethasone treatment. The fetuses were killed by cesarean section at term. Victorian blue van Gieson staining and immunostaining with antialpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA) were performed on lung tissue. The degree of adventitial thickness and area, and medial thickness and area were measured in pulmonary arteries by image analyzer and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in adventitial thickness and area in group II compared with group I and III (P < .01). There was also a significant increase in medial thickness in group II compared with group I and III (P < .01). The degree of adventitial thickness and area and degree of medial thickness and area were similar in controls and maternal dexamethasone-treated CDH group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that antenatal maternal dexamethasone treatment prevents pulmonary artery structural changes in nitrofen-induced CDH in rats.

TI  - Combinatorial chemistry in insects: a library of defensive macrocyclic polyamines [see comments]  
AB  - The pupal defensive secretion of the coccinellid beetle Epilachna borealis is composed principally of a combinatorial library of macrocyclic polyamines. These compounds constitute a previously unrecognized family of natural products, characterized by extremely large-ring lactonic structures derived from a small set of (2-hydroxyethylamino)alkanoic acids. The combinatorial assembly of these simple building blocks generates a high degree of structural diversity, which is further increased by slow, spontaneous intramolecular rearrangement of the macrocycles.

TI  - The mechanism for the effect of selenium supplementation on immunity.  
AB  - Lipid peroxide (LPO) in lymphocytes from mice was evaluated by measuring substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The product resulting from the reaction of TBA with lymphocytes was extracted with n-butyl and fluorescence intensity was determined.  The degree of lipid peroxidation, expressed as fluorescence intensity f547, was assessed for stimulation of lymphocytes with concanavalin A (Con A), and was related to lymphocyte proliferation in response to Con A if Se was administered. The lymphocyte proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, expressed as cpm. The effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD), added to cell culture on lymphocyte proliferation was also evaluated. It was found that LPO in lymphocytes before Con A stimulation was significantly less than that after stimulation (p < 0.001), and that SOD promoted lymphocyte proliferation dose dependently. The addition of Na2Seo3 to lymphocyte culture or supplementation in drinking water to mice decreased the produced LPO in lymphocyte in response to Con A. In the presence of Se, there is an inverse correlation between the levels of LPO in lymphocyte and the stimulated proliferation (r = -0.8902, r = -0.9439). In conclusion, active oxygen species scavenging was proposed as one of the mechanisms for Se to promote immunity.
