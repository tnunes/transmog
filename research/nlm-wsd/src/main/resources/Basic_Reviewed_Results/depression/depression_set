TI  - First night effect in depression: new data and a new approach.  
AB  - Polysomnography was performed in 20 depressed patients and 8 normal controls for 2 consecutive nights. A subset of patients had 3 consecutive nights. Patients were assigned to groups according to the presence (group I) or absence (group II) of a first night effect (REM sleep latency on the first night in the laboratory was at least 30 min longer than on the second night). The groups were equivalent with regard to gender distribution, age, and severity of depression. In group I, REM sleep latency on nights 2 and 3 was significantly shorter than in group II. REM sleep percentage on the second night in group I was increased compared to the first night. A shift of REM sleep to the first cycle was prominent on the first night only in patients with a first night effect. On average, delta sleep was preserved in group I compared to group II. We suggest that the first night effect reflects a physiological system with greater capacity to respond adaptively and to preserve homeostasis when confronted with environmental stressors.

TI  - REM sleep disinhibition at sleep onset: a comparison between narcolepsy and depression.  
AB  - Shortened REM latency and increased REM density are frequently observed in both narcolepsy and depression, suggesting a common mechanism of REM sleep disinhibition in these disorders. We compared night sleep recordings of 24 depressive and 24 narcoleptic patients. The amount of REM sleep and REM density did not differ between the patient groups; however, REM latency distributions differed significantly. Whereas in narcoleptic patients REM episodes started either immediately at sleep onset or following at least 60 min of non-REM sleep, in depressives two thirds of REM latencies were in the range from 1 to 60 min. In narcoleptic patients, short as compared to long REM latencies were associated with longer total sleep time, greater sleep efficiency, reduced amounts of wakefulness, and increased amounts of slow-wave sleep.  In depressive subjects the reverse pattern was seen. We conclude that a common mechanism of REM sleep disinhibition in narcolepsy and depression is very unlikely.

TI  - Screening for depression in low-vision elderly.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in older low-vision patients, and to compare GDS scores with the diagnosis of major depression in statistical models examining the interrelationships of vision, depression and disability. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Community-residing older persons attending the low-vision clinic of Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, USA. MEASUREMENTS: Geriatric Depression Scale, DSM-III-R Checklist for Depression, Community Disability Scale and Snellen Visual Acuity. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the GDS (GDS = 11) were 63% and 77%, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the GDS's ability to discriminate patients with and without major depression was no better than chance. Although the GDS was limited as a screen for major depression, it was useful in statistical models examining the interrelationships of vision, depression and disability. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are common among elderly patients with impaired vision attending a low-vision clinic. Although the GDS is unable to discriminate patients with and without major depression in this population, it is valuable as a continuous measure of depressive symptomatology to examine the interrelationships of vision, depression and disability.

TI  - Application of a first-pass effect model to characterize the pharmacokinetic disposition of venlafaxine after oral administration to human subjects.  
AB  - Venlafaxine (VEN), a drug used in the treatment of depression, undergoes significant first-pass metabolism after oral dosing to O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), a metabolite with comparable therapeutic activity to that of parent drug. The pharmacokinetic disposition of VEN was characterized using a "first-pass" model that incorporates a presystemic compartment (liver) to account for the first-pass metabolism of VEN to ODV. A series of differential equations were simultaneously fitted to plasma concentrations of parent and metabolite. A good fit of the model to observed data was demonstrated, generating estimates for the following parameters: ka (1.31 +/- 0.009 hr-1), VVEN (252 +/- 87.6 liters), CLint (65.8 +/- 39.7 liters/hr), RL (liver:plasma partition coefficient, 29.6 +/- 18. 3), VODV (181 +/- 84.1 liters), and CLODV (23.5 +/- 12.5 liters/hr). Parameter estimates correlated closely with those obtained through noncompartmental methods. These results indicate that the time-course disposition of a compound undergoing first-pass hepatic metabolism after oral dosing can be successfully modeled.

TI  - Hallucinosis in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hallucinosis is a complication of the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease commonly thought to afflict older, chronically medicated, cognitively impaired patients. However, patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of short duration experiencing hallucinosis on relatively low doses of dopaminergic medication have been found. The aim, therefore, was to investigate the homogeneity of a population of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and hallucinosis. METHODS: The clinical, demographic, and cognitive correlates of hallucinosis were investigated in a sample of 129 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: There were two subgroups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease experiencing hallucinosis. In patients with a disease duration of five years or less, hallucinosis was associated with rapid progression of the motor component of the disease but not cognitive impairment. In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of longer than five years duration, hallucinosis was associated with postural instability, global cognitive impairment, and lack of depressive affect. In all patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, hallucinosis was more prevalent when they were treated with a direct acting dopamine receptor agonist. Hallucinosis was not associated with age at onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease or dosage of dopaminergic medication. CONCLUSION: Hallucinosis in idiopathic Parkinson's disease is heterogeneous, falling into two groups. The difference in the pathophysiological basis of hallucinosis in these two groups of patients is discussed.

TI  - Comparison of rats selectively bred for high and low ethanol intake in a forced-swim-test model of depression: effects of desipramine.  
AB  - This investigation examined if there is a relationship between selective breeding for high or low alcohol intake and immobility in a force-swim-test (i.e., "behavioral despair") model of depression. Time spent immobile in a water-filled cylinder was measured in the alcohol-preferring (P and nonpreferring (NP) lines of rats, and in the high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) lines. Each rat was tested for 2 10-min trials administered 24 h apart, and pretreatment with saline or desipramine (10.0 or 20.0 mg desipramine/kg b.wt. i.p.) also was evaluated. Drug was administered immediately after Trial 1 and again 1 h before Trial 2. When tested without pretreatment in Trial 1 or with saline pretreatment in Trial 2, NP rats spent significantly more time immobile than did P rats, but no comparable line differences were found when HAD and LAD rats were tested. Desipramine pretreatment reduced the time spent immobile in rats of the 2 alcohol-nonpreferring lines (i.e., the NP and LAD rats), but had no significant effect in rats of the 2 alcohol-preferring lines (the P and HAD rats). These findings do not support the hypothesis that there is a functional relationship between high alcohol drinking and susceptibility to "behavioral despair" as measured by the forced-swim test. The results with desipramine suggest that selection for high alcohol intake may be associated with insensitivity to desipramine.

TI  - Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and depression in a middle-aged Finnish population.  
AB  - A hypothesis of a psychosocial origin of depression in diabetic persons (mainly patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) was tested. The population consisted of all the 1008 persons born in 1935 and living in a Finnish city (Oulu) on 1 October 1990. Data were collected in two phases. A screening for NIDDM and a collection of back ground data were carried out in the first phase. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed in the second phase in order to detect those with previously undiagnosed NIDDM, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). Participants who scored 45 raw sum points or more were considered as suffering from depression. All those who were aware of their diabetes before the second phase were considered as previously diagnosed diabetics. Depression (raw sum score 45 points or more on the ZSDS) was associated with previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus, while it was not associated with undiagnosed diabetes. The sum scores on the ZSDS did not differ significantly from each other in the groups classified according to diabetic status. This finding was explained by the sum score of the ZSDS among the previously diagnosed diabetics, which had a skewed distribution towards higher sum scores. Among the previously diagnosed diabetic patients, all those who were depressed were on sick leave or retired, while the corresponding proportion for non-depressed patients was 52% (P = 0.009). The number of diagnosed diseases was higher among the former than the latter group (P = 0.025). Severe depressive symptoms were not associated with a more serious metabolic disease, but they tended to be associated with a great number of diagnosed diseases and with being on sick leave or retired. The results showed that the impact of diabetes mellitus itself on depression was not strong. Depression was not connected to elevated fasting blood glucose levels, but instead to a great number of diagnosed diseases and unfavourable social factors, such as being on sick leave or retired, which suggests a psychosocial origin of depression in NIDDM patients.

TI  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase variant and schizophrenia/depression.  
AB  - Patients with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency often show psychiatric manifestations. Since a common variant of the MTHFR gene, T677(Ala), responsible for the thermolabile MTHFR with less than 50% specific MTHFR activity, has been reported, we examined whether the T677 allele is associated with psychiatric disorders in an unrelated Japanese population consisting of 297 schizophrenics, 32 patients with major depression, 40 patients with bipolar disorder, and 419 controls. The genotype homozygous for the T677 allele was significantly frequently observed in schizophrenics with an odds ratio of 1.9 (P = 0.0006), and in patients with major depression with an odds ratio of 2.8 (P = 0.005). Our data suggest associations of the MTHFR gene variant with schizophrenia and depression in the Japanese.

TI  - 'Vascular depression' hypothesis [see comments]  
AB  - We propose that cerebrovascular disease may predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate some geriatric depressive syndromes. The "vascular depression" hypothesis is supported by the comorbidity of depression, vascular disease, and vascular risk factors and the association of ischemic lesions to distinctive behavioral symptoms. Disruption of prefrontal systems or their modulating pathways by single lesions or by an accumulation of lesions exceeding a threshold are hypothesized to be central mechanisms in vascular depression. The vascular depression concept can generate studies of clinical and heuristic value. Drugs used for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease may be shown to reduce the risk for vascular depression or improve its outcomes. The choice of antidepressants in vascular depression may depend on their effect on neurologic recovery from ischemic lesions. Research can clarify the pathways to vascular depression by focusing on the site of the lesion, the resultant brain dysfunction, the presentation of depression and time of onset, and the contribution of nonbiological factors.

TI  - Natural history of Diagnostic Interview Schedule/DSM-IV major depression. The Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area follow-up [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural history can be characterized by incidence, recurrence, and duration of episodes. Research on the incidence of major depression is rare; studies of recurrence and duration are limited to clinical samples. METHODS: The Baltimore, Md, site of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program followed up its 1981 baseline cohort of 3481 respondents with an additional assessment in 1993 to 1996. Interviews were obtained from 1920 respondents (73% of the survivors). The Diagnostic Interview Schedule and the same survey procedures as in 1981 were used, augmented with a Life Chart Interview for dating the onset and duration of syndromes. RESULTS: There were 71 new cases of Diagnostic interview Schedule/DSM-IV major depression and 23,698 person-years of exposure, generating an estimated incidence of 3.0 per 1000 per year. Incidence peaked while subjects were in their 30s, with a smaller peak when they were in their 50s. Prodromal symptoms often occurred many years before the full criteria for diagnosis were met. Women were at higher risk for becoming new cases but had neither higher risk for recurrence nor longer episodes than men. Episodes of depression lasted for 12 weeks. The duration of an episode, and time to an episode-free year, was longer in the first episode than in recurrent episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence estimated in this study is consistent with that found in the few other similar studies performed. The bimodality of onset suggests the value of further exploring the heterogeneity of depression via its natural history. Reported differences in prevalence between men and women seem to be due to differences in incidence, not chronicity.

TI  - Factor structure of symptoms in functional psychoses.  
AB  - Global ratings from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms were subjected to principal-component analysis (PCA) in 80 schizophrenia patients, 76 patients with schizophreniform disorder, 80 patients with schizoaffective and mood disorders, and 78 patients with delusional, brief reactive, and atypical psychoses. The resulting factors were correlated with depressive, manic, and catatonic syndromes, and subjected to a multivariate analysis of variance across DSM-III-R diagnoses. PCAs revealed that psychosis, disorganization, and negative factors were also present in each of the nonschizophrenic groups. The disorganization factor tended to be related to the manic syndrome, and the negative factor to depressive and catatonic syndromes. Overall, the three factors had little diagnostic relevance in functional psychoses, although the negative factor was relatively more characteristic of schizophrenia. The data suggest that positive, negative, and disorganization factors are not specific to schizophrenia; this is consistent with a dimensional view of psychopathology in functional psychoses.

TI  - Hypericin and pseudohypericin: pharmacokinetics and effects on photosensitivity in humans.  
AB  - Extracts of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) are used in treatment of depression. They contain various substances with the naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin as characteristic ingredients. These compounds were shown to cause phototoxicity in cell culture and in animals. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with monitoring of hypericin and pseudohypericin plasma concentration was performed to evaluate the increase in dermal photosensitivity in humans after application of high dose hypericum extracts. The study was divided into a single dose and a multiple dose part. In the single dose period, each of 13 volunteers received in a double blind fourfold complete crossover design, either placebo, or 900, 1800 or 3600 mg of a standardized hypericum extract (LI 160) containing zero, 2.81, 5.62 and 11.25 mg of total hypericin (total hypericin is the sum of hypericin and pseudohypericin). Maximum total hypericin plasma concentrations were observed about 4 h after dosage and were 0, 0.028, 0.061 and 0.159 mg/L, respectively. Before and 4 h after drug intake, the subjects were exposed at small areas of their back to increasing doses of solar simulated irradiation (SSI, with combined ultraviolet A, UV-A, and UV-B light) and another part was exposed to selective UV-A light irradiation. Minimal erythema dose was determined 5, 20 and 68 h after irradiation. Comparison of SSI sensitivity without and with hypericum extract did not show and difference and there was no dose-related trend in light sensitivity. Sensitivity to selective UV-A light was increased only after the highest dose from a minimal tanning dose of 10.8 J/ cm2 (mean) after placebo to 8.7 J/cm2 after 3600 mg extract with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.03 by one sided paired t-test). There was no correlation between total hypericin plasma concentrations and photosensitivity. In the multiple dose part, 50 volunteers received 600 mg hypericum extract t.i.d. with a daily dose of 5.6 mg of total hypericin. Comparison of UV light sensitivity before dosing with day 15 of treatment showed a slightly increased SSI sensitivity expressed by decrease of the MED from 0.17 to 0.16 J/cm2 (p = 0.005 by Wilcoxon test), and similarly, sensitivity to UV-A light increased (the mean tanning dose decreased from 9.9 to 7.8 J/cm2, p < 0.0001). This increase in cutaneous light sensitivity could be compensated by reducing irradiation time by 21%. Doses used in this study were higher than typical doses in current commercial preparations. In spite of these high doses in the double blind single dose part, frequency of side effects was equal to placebo medication and UV light sensitivity was not or only marginally increased. The study does not, however, exclude phototoxic reactions with doses above 11.25 mg of total hypericin and plasma levels above 100 micrograms/L. Furthermore, phototoxicity may be different after application of pure hypericin, since some constituents in the plant extract may exhibit protective effects.

AB  - We report on adverse drug reactions to statins recorded internationally and in Norway. The use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has increased with a factor of 30 in Norway over the period 1989-96. Recently published clinical trials conclude that statins are safe; adverse drug reactions being infrequent and non-serious. The reactions observed are mostly increased hepatic enzymes and myopathy. Data from the Norwegian spontaneous reporting system, and from WHO's international database covering the period of 1988-95, includes reports of adverse drug reactions relating to other organ systems, such as the nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, skin and cardiovascular organs. Psychiatric disorders represent 15% of the reactions to statins in the Norwegian database. Reactions include aggression, nervousness, depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders and impotence. The pharmacological mechanisms are not elucidated, but may be an effect of falling serum cholesterol.

TI  - Relation of lesion location to verbal and nonverbal mood measures in stroke patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relation between poststroke depression and lesion location, avoiding previous methodological shortcomings. In particular, we intended to determine whether patients with left frontal lesions showed the highest depression scores. METHODS: Patients in the study, categorized on the basis of lesion location, included 149 stroke patients with lesions located in the anterior, central, or posterior regions of the right or left hemisphere. Verbal and nonverbal mood measures as well as the Hamilton Depression Scale Overall Score were the dependent measures of our investigation. Furthermore, the number of patients who could not be assessed or could be evaluated only with the nonverbal mood measure due to the presence of severe language disorders was recorded. RESULTS: No significant relation was observed between depressed mood and lesion location. Approximately one quarter of the left brain-damaged patients were partially or totally excluded from the study because of severe language disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data appeared to show that when methodological pitfalls and selection bias are carefully controlled, left frontal lesions are not a major determinant of poststroke depression.

AB  - The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) is a short self-rating scale composed of 20 items, designed to detect depressive symptomatology. It has demonstrated its sensibility in psychiatric patients and general population. The CES-D was administered to 99 patients, 33 men and 66 women with mean age of 44.14 years. The patients had been diagnosed of: Major Depressive Disorder (74%), Bipolar Disorder (10%), Adaptive Disorder with depressive mood (10%) and other mood disorders (6%) according to DSM-IIIR criteria. In order to study the validity and reliability of the CES-D, we administered the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and analogical scales to all the patients. In the reliability analysis we obtain 0.9 alpha. The factor analysis show 4 factors who explain the 58.8% of the variance: "depresses Affect/Somatic", "Positive Affect", "Irritability/Hopelessness", "Interpersonal/Social". The scale shows a 0.95 sensibility and 0.91 specificity to depressive symptomatology detection (according to scores equal or over 9 on HRSD) taking as cutoff scores equal or over 16 on CES-D. Our results show that the CES-D is a sensitive and specify tool for depressive symptomatology detection in psychiatric population. The CES-D is easy to be completed and evaluated, therefore may be useful in epidemiologic studies in general populations.

TI  - Race, foster care, and the politics of abandonment in New York City [see comments]  
AB  - Following the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the sectarian system of foster care services in New York City practiced open discrimination. African-American children were generally segregated in a small number of overcrowded and understaffed all-Black institutions. As the African-American migration to the city accelerated in the years following the outbreak of World War II, a small group of psychologists, jurists, philanthropists, and social workers began a systematic challenge to this system. This paper explores the role of racism in shaping New York's foster care system and the experience of African-American children who were forced to depend on services originally organized to serve Whites. It also looks at the ways race affected the way children were typed--as mentally ill, delinquent, or even criminal--in response to the structural realities of a system that sorted children into separate types of institutions according to race. The paper also provides the background for understanding the landmark challenge to segregation of children in sectarian and public institutions represented by Wilder v Sugarman.

TI  - Dementia associated with dorsal midbrain lesion.  
AB  - Although the dorsal midbrain has been implicated in cognitive processes in animals, its role in humans is unclear. We report the neuropsychological and postmortem neuropathological findings of a 52-yr-old university professor who developed a profound dementia in association with a focal dorsal midbrain lesion. The patient's disorder appeared to result from a tuberculous granuloma based on the clinical course and autopsy results. Neuropsychologically, he exhibited a generalized impairment across most of the cognitive domains assessed. His deficits were not explained by impaired arousal, specific sensory or motor defects, depression, or hydrocephalus. Although there are inherent limitations to a single-case investigation, our observations are consistent with animal studies that have demonstrated that focal dorsal midbrain lesions may result in cognitive impairment. We propose that the dorsal midbrain is involved in cognitive processing via modulation of thalamocortical networks.

TI  - Differences in psychosocial and health correlates of major and minor depression in medically ill older adults.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in correlates of different levels of depression in medically ill hospitalized older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive series of 542 patients aged 60 or older admitted to the medical inpatient services of Duke Hospital underwent a structured psychiatric evaluation administered by a psychiatrist. MEASUREMENT: A wide range of demographic, social, psychiatric, and physical health data were collected, and associations with major and minor depression were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with patients without depression, those with major depression were more likely to have a history of prior episodes of depression, higher dysfunctional attitude scores, greater overall severity of medical illness, cognitive impairment, and symptoms of pain or other somatic complaints. Specific medical diagnosis was less important a predictor of major depression than overall severity of medical illness. Compared with patients without depression, those with minor depression were more likely to report non-health-related stressors during the year before hospital admission, have a diagnosis of immune system disorder, and have greater severity of medical illness. When major and minor depression were compared directly, on the other hand, no significant differences were observed except for history of depression, and that relationship was weak and present only when the etiologic approach to diagnosis was used. CONCLUSION: During hospital admission, certain psychosocial, psychiatric, and physical health characteristics of older medical patients place them at high risk for different levels of depression. Patients with major and minor depression resemble each other more than they do patients without depression. These findings may help clinicians better understand the causes of different types of depression in this setting and lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Stress-restress: effects on ACTH and fast feedback.  
AB  - Glucocorticoid secretion is tightly regulated by negative feedback. Glucocorticoid feedback has been found to be altered in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While hyposensitive glucocorticoid feedback has been found in depression, hypersensitive or enhanced negative feedback was described in PTSD. Enhanced negative feedback, can be seen as a sensitization of the inhibitory elements of HPA axis, and stress-restress or time dependent sensitization (TDS) model, has been suggested as an animal model for PTSD. We have studied the effects of this model on the HPA axis to determine whether it will produce increased sensitivity to negative feedback as found in PTSD patients. Adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were exposed to a single session of prolonged stress (restraint followed by a forced swim and exposure to ether vapors) and briefly restressed 7 days later. The effects of single prolonged stress on plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses (0, 5, and 30 min) and on glucocorticoid fast feedback (cortisol vs. saline pretreatment) were assessed in two studies. Animals exposed to single prolonged stress showed enhanced negative feedback in comparison to naive animals (F = 4.6371, df = 3, p = .0107), but there was no difference in ACTH or corticosterone responses during the restress. Pretreatment with cortisol, in the first stress session, did not prevent the development of the enhanced fast feedback when restressed. This can be seen as a sensitization of the inhibitory elements of HPA axis, suggesting that stress-restress paradigm might serve as a good animal model for HPA abnormalities found in PTSD patients.

TI  - Depression in multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: An association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and depression has been recognized for several decades and has attracted considerable attention in research. However, there are considerable gaps in the current state of knowledge. In this review, the literature concerned with: (1) the burden of depression in MS; (2) the etiology of depression in MS, and (3) the treatment of depression in MS are critically examined. METHOD: The literature review utilized Medline (1966-1996), and was supplemented by citations extracted from the papers originally uncovered. RESULTS: Numerous studies have identified elevated depressive symptom scores in MS patients relative to nonclinical and (some) clinical control groups. Furthermore, studies of depressive disorders have clearly documented elevated prevalence rates in MS samples. The literature does not identify any specific pattern of neurological involvement as being consistently associated with depressive symptoms or disorders. Psychosocial risk factors contribute to the etiology of depression in MS, but the relative importance of various risk factors is yet to be determined. A single randomized controlled clinical trial, and additional anecdotal evidence, suggests that antidepressant pharmacotherapy is effective for depressive disorders in MS. CONCLUSIONS: Future epidemiological studies should not restrict their evaluation of risk factors to those specific factors that are closely related to the disease process. In particular, future researchers should resist the temptation to focus too exclusively on neuropathology. Biological, psychological and social risk factors are all potentially important. Additional empirical efforts to refine the various treatment approaches would be a welcome addition to this literature.

TI  - Differential effects of nitrous oxide and propofol on myogenic transcranial motor evoked responses during sufentanil anaesthesia [see comments]  
AB  - We have compared the effects of 50% nitrous oxide and propofol, each administered concurrently with sufentanil, on the amplitudes and latencies of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) response to transcranial electrical stimulation. Using a crossover design, 12 patients undergoing spinal surgery were exposed to both 50% nitrous oxide and propofol, the latter in a bolus-infusion regimen. Six patients received nitrous oxide first and six received propofol first. CMAP were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle in response to both single and paired transcranial electrical stimuli. With single pulse stimulation, median CMAP amplitude was significantly greater during administration of nitrous oxide than propofol (nitrous oxide 335 (10th-90th percentiles 35-849) microV; propofol 36 (0-251) microV) (P < 0.01). With paired stimulation, there was no significant difference in CMAP amplitude during the two regimens (nitrous oxide 1031 (296-1939) microV; propofol 655 (0-1867) microV). The results indicate that propofol caused more depression of transcranial electrical motor evoked responses than 50% nitrous oxide but that the difference was probably clinically unimportant when a paired stimulation paradigm was used.

TI  - Clinical predictors of declines in physical functioning in persons with AIDS: results of a longitudinal study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed in an attempt to determine clinical correlates of declines in physical functioning in people with AIDS. DESIGN: An 8-month longitudinal cohort study was performed at three sites in Boston, Massachusetts: a private academic group practice, an AIDS clinic at a public teaching hospital, and a staff-model health maintenance organization. Intermediate activities of daily living (IADLs), 10 symptoms and symptom complexes, mental health, and weight loss were assessed by interview in 201 persons with AIDS. Clinical diagnoses, comorbidities, laboratory results, and use of selected medications were assessed by chart review. RESULTS: Participants were young (mean age, 36 years), 92% were male, 35% were nonwhite, and 27% had a history of injection drug use. The mean 8-month decrement in physical functioning was 9.6 points on a 100-point scale, and mean weight loss was 2.3 kg. After adjusting for baseline functioning, age, sex, race, and educational level, independent predictors of the 8-month IADL score included worsening fatigue (p = .0002), worsening neurologic symptoms (p = .001), weight loss (p = .0001), Candida esophagitis (p = .020), hypertension (p = .0005), depression (p = .004), and gastrointestinal (GI) disease (p = .018, model R2 = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Two symptom complexes (fatigue and neurologic symptoms), three comorbidities (hypertension, depression, and GI disease), and weight loss were significant independent predictors of 8-month IADL scores after statistically controlling for baseline IADL score and sociodemographic variables. These clinical factors are potential targets for interventions designed to improve physical functioning.

TI  - Attentional biases for negative information in induced and naturally occurring dysphoria.  
AB  - Two studies investigated the relationship between attentional biases for negative information and dysphoria--both induced (Study 1) and naturally occurring (Study 2). In a modified dot probe task a series of word pairs was presented, and Ss responded to probes that replaced one of the words in each pair. The stimuli included depression-related, anxiety-related and neutral words. To examine the time course of the attentional biases, there were three exposure durations of the word pairs: 14 ms (+ 186 ms mask); 500 ms and 1000 ms. In Study 1, the depressed mood induction procedure was associated with greater vigilance for depression-related words at 500 ms, with a similar trend at 1000 ms. In Study 2, measures of depressed mood and vulnerability correlated positively with vigilance for negative words in the 1000 ms condition. There was no evidence from either study that depressed mood was associated with a pre-conscious bias for negative words (i.e. in the 14 ms masked exposure condition). However, this pre-conscious bias was associated with high trait anxiety in Study 2, consistent with previous research. The results are discussed in relation to theoretical and empirical work on cognitive biases in clinical and non-clinical anxiety and depression.

TI  - Predictors of reported condom use in central Harlem youth as conceptualized by the health belief model.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the relationship of reported condom use to specific sociodemographics, psychosocial variables, and perceptions of and motivations for condom use as conceptualized by the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This study performed a cross-sectional survey of 557 adolescents enrolled in a hospital-based pregnancy prevention program in an urban community hospital (Harlem Hospital). Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the combined relationship of the significant psychosocial variables to consistent condom use. RESULTS: Males were less likely than females to report teen-parent conflict and depression and more likely to report support for birth control, participation in community activities, and favorable attitudes toward delaying parenthood. Consistent with the Health Belief Model adjusting for age, the strongest predictors of consistent condom use were partner preference for condoms, perceived benefit of avoidance of pregnancy, male gender, and support for birth control (usually by a parent). CONCLUSIONS: The data on this urban, predominantly African-American sample of adolescents suggest the importance of the influences on specific motivations to use protection--that is, the wish to avoid pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and sexually transmitted diseases, although the mechanisms are still unclear. In addition, gender and the modifying effects of parental and partner support of the use of protection strongly influence the reported use of condoms by adolescents. These factors (in addition to psychosocial factors such as depression) may be important in planning interventions to increase condom use by sexually active teens.

TI  - Triiodothyronine, a regulator of osteoblastic differentiation: depression of histone H4, attenuation of c-fos/c-jun, and induction of osteocalcin expression.  
AB  - Thyroid hormones influence growth and differentiation of bone cells. In vivo and in vitro data indicate their importance for development and maintenance of the skeleton. Triiodothyronine (T3) inhibits proliferation and accelerates differentiation of osteoblasts. We studied the regulatory effect of T3 on markers of proliferation as well as on specific markers of the osteoblastic phenotype in cultured MC3T3-E1 cells at different time points. In parallel to the inhibitory effect on proliferation, T3 down-regulated histone H4 mRNA expression. Early genes (c-fos/c-jun) are highly expressed in proliferating cells and are down-regulated when the cells switch to differentiation. When MC3T3-E1 cells are cultured under serum-free conditions, basal c-fos/c-jun expressions are nearly undetectable. Under these conditions, c-fos/c-jun mRNAs can be stimulated by EGF, the effect of which is attenuated to about 46% by T3. In addition, T3 stimulated the expression at the mRNA and protein level of osteocalcin, a marker of mature osteoblasts and alkaline phosphatase activity. All these effects were more pronounced when cells were cultured for more than 6 days. These data indicate that T3 acts as a differentiation factor in osteoblasts by influencing the expression of cell cycle-regulated, of cell growth-regulated, and of phenotypic genes.

TI  - Major depression in a population of demented and nondemented older people: prevalence and correlates.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the differences between variables associated with depression and symptoms of depression in demented and nondemented persons. DESIGN: A survey design was used. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1101 older persons registered in a district of Stockholm, Sweden, participated in the study. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were given physical and psychiatric examinations by physicians, and informants interviews and medical records were assessed. Dementia was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) criteria and major depression according to DSM-IV. The variables studied were age, gender, martial status, institutionalization, Mini-Mental State Exam score, disability in daily life, physical disorders with symptoms affecting daily life, and a previous history of depression (early and late). RESULTS: 27.8% of the patients in the study sample were demented according to DSM-III-R. Major depression was diagnosed in 3.9% of the nondemented and in 11.8% of the demented subjects. Some of the depressive symptoms, such as lack of energy, thinking/concentration difficulties, loss of interest, and psychomotor disturbance, were found more commonly in demented than in nondemented persons. Increased disability was associated with major depression both in demented and nondemented persons. CONCLUSION: In this study, the prevalence of depression was higher in demented than in nondemented persons. Among the factors that were studied, increased disability was associated with depression both in demented and nondemented persons. No differences were found regarding the other studied variables.

TI  - The cerebral and cardiovascular effects of cisatracurium and atracurium in neurosurgical patients.  
AB  - Drugs for neurosurgical patients should not increase intracranial pressure (ICP) or change cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow. This double-blind, cross-over study compares the effects of a single (3 x effective dose producing 95% twitch depression) intravenous bolus dose of cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg with atracurium 0.75 mg/kg on mean red blood cell flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (CBFV; transcranial Doppler), ICP (intraventricular or intraparenchymal monitor), mean arterial pressure (MAP), CPP (MAP-ICP), and heart rate (HR) every minute during a 15-min study period. Included in the study were 14 sedated and ventilated adult neurosurgical patients. After the cisatracurium bolus, ICP, CPP, CBFV, MAP, and HR did not change, and no histamine related events were observed. After the atracurium bolus, ICP, CPP, CBFV, and MAP decreased. The lowest values of ICP (-16% of baseline), CPP (-5%), CBFV (-8%), and MAP (-7%) were recorded 2-4 min after the atracurium bolus injection. After this transient decrease, MAP and CPP returned to baseline, whereas CBFV and ICP transiently exceeded baseline values. The highest values of CBFV (5%) and ICP (17%) were recorded 9-12 min after the atracurium bolus injection. Five patients showed a typical histamine response after atracurium, with a decrease in MAP and flushing. Excluding these five patients eliminated statistical significance in ICP, CPP, CBFV, and MAP differences. In conclusion, cisatracurium demonstrated fewer cerebral and cardiovascular hemodynamic side effects in sedated adult neurosurgical patients. Implications: This double-blind study in sedated and mechanically ventilated adult neurosurgical patients demonstrates that an intravenous bolus dose of the neuromuscular blocker cisatracurium results in less cerebral (intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity) and cardiovascular (blood pressure) hemodynamic side effects, compared with an equipotent dose of atracurium.

TI  - Depression and dementia in relation to apolipoprotein E polymorphism in a population sample age 75+.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to define the co-occurrence of depression and dementia in relation to apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism. Physicians extensively examined 806 persons aged 78 years and over. DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells, and APOE genotype was determined using a microsequencing method on microtiter plates. The prevalence of dementia was 22.8% and was found to increase with the number of epsilon 4 alleles present. Depression was found in 11.4% of the demented subjects compared to 3.5% of the nondemented subjects. The overrepresentation of depression in demented subjects was found for each of the common genotypes. Depression was not strongly associated with APOE polymorphism. In spite of the association between dementia and APOE polymorphism, as well as dementia and depression, there was no association between APOE polymorphism and depression.

TI  - Preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the prospective life-chart methodology (LCM-p).  
AB  - This article describes the use of the NIMH prospective life-charting methodology (NIMH LCM-p) in the context of a formal double-blind, clinical trial and provides preliminary evidence of its reliability and validity. Subjects included in this report were 30 outpatients with bipolar I and II disorder who completed the first 2 years of a long-term maintenance study: 1 year on carbamazepine or lithium and a crossover to the other in the second year. The LCM-p follows the same types of guidelines and principles utilized in the previously described retrospective life-chart process, allowing for continuity of illness assessment prior and subsequent to study entry. In the LCM-p, daily ratings of severity of mood symptoms based on the degree of associated functional incapacity, provide a more detailed topography of manic and depressive fluctuations. Inter-rater reliability was examined by comparing the severity of daily LCM-p ratings assigned by two raters. In order to assess the validity, we correlated the LCM-p ratings with well-standardized scales, including Hamilton and Beck Depression Ratings, Young Mania Ratings and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). The Kappa scores for inter-rater reliability demonstrated significant and satisfactory strength of agreement with no fall off over 14 days prior to the rating interview. Strong correlations were found: (1) between the LCM-p average severity for depression rating and the mean Hamilton Depression Rating (r = 0.86, p < .001), and the Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.73, p < .001); 2) between the LCM-p average severity for mania rating and the Young Mania Rating Scale (r = 0.61, p < .001); and (3) between the LCM-p average severity and the GAS (r = -0.81, p < .001). These preliminary data suggest the reliability and validity of the NIMH-LCM-p in assessing manic and depressive episode severity. It also provides a useful continuous daily measure of affective illness-related symptom fluctuations that allows for detailed prospective assessment of frequency and pattern of illness, treatment response, and continuity with retrospective life chart assessments.

TI  - Utilization patterns of tricyclic antidepressants in a multidisciplinary pain clinic: a survey.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) have been shown to provide analgesia for a variety of neuropathic and headache pain syndromes regardless of the presence of depression. There is a high incidence of depression in patients with chronic pain, thereby making tricyclic antidepressants particularly suitable for chronic pain patients. We wanted to study patterns of use of tricyclic antidepressants in our Pain Management Center (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA, U.S.A.) primarily to answer four questions: (1) What percentage of all patients were treated with tricyclic antidepressants? (2) How many patients were treated with each antidepressant, and what was the dose range used for individual antidepressants? (3) Were tricyclic antidepressants beneficial for chronic pain, and was that response dependent on a particular dose? (4) Did patients receive an adequate TCA trial, and what factors led to the discontinuation of a TCA trial? METHODS: A total of 1,145 pain clinic patient charts were reviewed in alphabetical sequence. A total of 282 patients were identified as being treated with tricyclic antidepressants. Data were obtained from these 282 charts regarding the patient's age, diagnosis, tricyclic antidepressant use and dose, other pain treatments, response to treatment, and side effects. The existing diagnosis of depression was documented if possible. Tricyclic antidepressant doses were defined as low doses when the equivalent of 50 mg or less of amitriptyline was used, and as full doses when the equivalent of at least 150 mg of amitriptyline was used. Response to treatment was noted as mild, moderate, or marked improvement. Patients reporting mild improvement were considered nonresponders. RESULTS: Of 1,145 patients, 282 were treated with tricyclic antidepressants. A total of 205 (73%) of the patients were treated with low doses and only 34 (12%) with full doses. The remaining 43 (15%) received intermediate doses. Amitriptyline was the most commonly used drug (58%). Amitriptyline and doxepin appeared to be more effective than other tricyclic antidepressants. The rate of response to our treatment among the 31 patients with a coexisting diagnosis of depression was similar to the patients without documented depression. In patients with tricyclic antidepressants as the only treatment, there was only a trend toward greater response with full dose. In terms of side effects causing dose limitation or discontinuation of the drug, clomipramine, amitriptyline, and doxepin appeared to be worse than imipramine, desipramine, and nortriptyline. CONCLUSION: Tricyclic antidepressants were used in 25% of patients referred to a multidisciplinary pain center and were commonly used in low to intermediate doses, even in situations in which there were neither side effects nor optimal clinical response.

TI  - Short-term afferent axotomy increases both strength and depression at Ia-motoneuron synapses in Rat.  
AB  - Synaptic efficacy at the rat Ia-motoneuron synapse has been reported to increase in vivo, within 3 d of sectioning a single muscle nerve (). We provide an indirect test of the hypothesis that this increase is caused by altered probability of transmitter release of axotomized afferents. Experiments consisted of in vivo recording of maximal composite group I EPSPs evoked in intact rat medial gastrocnemius (MG) motoneurons by stimulation of the lateral gastrocnemius-soleus nerve (LG-S). We compared the maximal LG-S EPSP amplitude and the response to high-frequency stimulation (modulation) recorded in untreated rats, with the same measures recorded in rats that had the LG-S nerve axotomized 3 d before data collection. In confirmation of previous work, the mean amplitude of LG-S EPSPs evoked by stimulation of axotomized afferents was significantly larger than that measured in untreated rats (3.9 +/- 0. 34 and 2.3 +/- 0.19 mV, respectively). The increase in EPSP amplitude was accompanied by significantly greater negative modulation (depression) of EPSP amplitude during high-frequency stimulation (-39 +/- 4% and -53 +/- 4%, untreated and treated, respectively). Modulation would not be expected to change if the increase in EPSP amplitude was attributable solely to a greater number of afferent connections (). Therefore, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial axotomy-induced increase in synaptic efficacy occurs because of an increase in the probability of transmitter release. Furthermore, these results suggest that the probability of transmitter release at this synapse is regulated by either afferent activity and/or trophic communication with the target muscle.

TI  - Two-year outcome of psychotic depression in late life.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether elderly patients with psychotic depression differed in long-term outcome from patients with nonpsychotic depression. METHOD: The study group consisted of 19 patients with psychotic major depression who had responded to ECT (N = 15), nortriptyline and perphenazine (N = 2), or nortriptyline, perphenazine, and adjunctive lithium (N = 2) and 68 nonpsychotic depressed patients who had responded to either nortriptyline alone (N = 61) or nortriptyline and lithium (N = 7). All patients were maintained on regimens of full-dose nortriptyline. When prescribed for the index episode, adjunctive lithium was also maintained, but perphenazine was withdrawn 16 weeks after response. Patients were followed on a monthly basis for 2 years or until relapse or recurrence, whichever occurred first. RESULTS: Patients with psychotic depression had a substantially higher frequency of relapse or recurrence of depression and a shorter time to these events than nonpsychotic depressed patients. At index assessment, patients with psychosis were more severely depressed and had had more prior episodes of depression, but these factors did not account for the difference in outcome between the two groups. Furthermore, before entering the study, none of the psychotic patients had received adequate treatment for the index episode of depression, and so their poor outcome could not be attributed to prior treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Even when they achieved remission and were maintained on a regimen of full-dose antidepressant medication, older patients with psychotic depression were at greater risk of relapse or recurrence than were their nonpsychotic counterparts. In particular, continuation/maintenance treatment with tricyclic monotherapy following response to ECT had limited efficacy in this group of patients. These findings raise important questions about the optimal treatment of psychotic depression in late life.

TI  - Corticosterone and serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus: functional implications of central corticosteroid receptor diversity.  
AB  - The activity of the hippocampus is modulated by a serotonergic projection from the midbrain. Corticosteroids regulate the activity of this raphe-hippocampal system in various ways. These effects are differentially mediated via two types of central corticosteroid receptor types, the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the lower affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Under physiological fluctuations of corticosteroid concentrations, predominantly MR-mediated effects suppress the activity of the raphe-hippocampal system, notably serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor-related activity: 5-HT1A receptors are down-regulated, and the cellular response to 5-HT1A receptor activation is attenuated. Transiently increased concentrations of corticosteroids, as induced by stress, result in combined occupation of both MR and GR, and allow increased activity of the raphe-hippocampal system. Stimulatory actions of corticosteroids involving GR occupation include increased responsiveness of hippocampal neurons to 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, attenuated autoinhibition of 5-HT, and a permissive effect on stress-induced increases in 5-HT release. Under (pathological) conditions of chronically elevated corticosteroid concentrations, however, serotonergic neurotransmission is impaired. Human depression is an important example of a condition of combined hypercorticism and an apparent hypoactivity of serotonergic transmission. Deficiency of brain GR function may be genetically determined or acquired by stress. It is proposed that the balance of MR/GR activation can be altered by chronic (stress-related) changes of corticosteroid concentrations, in combination with glucocorticoid feedback resistance. Such an imbalance would lead to a relative dominance of MR-mediated suppressive effects on the activity of the raphe-hippocampal system, which may be a biologically relevant aspect of depression.

TI  - Intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors are associated with sleep disturbances in bereavement-related depression.  
AB  - Cognitive arousal has been associated with disrupted sleep in individuals with insomnia and may be one mechanism underlying sleep disturbances in depression. We evaluated the relationship of sleep to bereavement-related intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors in 40 men and women with major depression consequent to bereavement. Mean subject age was 65 years, 25% of the same was male, and median time since loss was 7.4 months. Levels of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors were similar to samples seeking treatment for stress response syndromes, including post-traumatic stress disorder. After controlling for the effects of age, time since loss, and depression severity, greater frequency of bereavement-related intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors was associated with longer sleep latency and lower delta sleep ratio (P values < .01). Intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors were not strongly related to gender, time since loss, depression severity, or subjective sleep quality. These results suggest that intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors affect sleep in bereavement-related depression and may therefore be related to the clinical course of depression.

TI  - 'Potency': the validation of information from a self-administered questionnaire using objective measurements of night-time erections and test-retest reliability.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity and reliability of a questionnaire assessing 'physiological potency'. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 89 patients with prostate cancer and 43 men without; the latter were attending a consultation clinic because of problems with erection. All men answered three questions assessing erectile rigidity during sexual activity, morning and spontaneous erections. In the questionnaire, 'potency' was defined as erectile rigidity 'sufficient for intercourse most of the time' or better. 'Potency' in one or more of the three aspects of erection was defined as 'physiological potency'. The patients with prostate cancer answered the questionnaire twice with a 3-week interval. The men attending the consultation clinic underwent two nights of erectile monitoring (using the RigiScan device) and the minimum criterion for RigiScan potency was defined as 55% rigidity at both tip and base. RESULTS: The test-retest assessment showed 93% conformity in the questionnaire diagnosis of 'physiological potency/impotence' between the tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire assessment compared with the RigiScan method were 40% and 100%, respectively, when the question assessing sexually stimulated erectile rigidity was used alone. Using 'physiological potency', the sensitivity increased to about 60% without jeopardizing the specificity, and when men reporting depression were excluded from the analysis, the sensitivity increased to about 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was satisfactory. Using questions in a self-administered questionnaire, 'physiological impotence' can be diagnosed with complete and 'physiological potency' with 60-80% sensitivity. The sensitivity of the self-assessment for 'potency' depended on the number of questions asked and the proportion of men reporting depression.

TI  - Extended outpatient rehabilitation: its influence on symptom frequency, fatigue, and functional status for persons with progressive multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of an extended outpatient rehabilitation program on symptom frequency, fatigue, and functional status for persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Nonequivalent pretest/posttest control-group design, with posttest 1 year after initial assessment. Multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance were used to control for symptom severity at the initial assessment and comorbid factors including depression, cognitive function, and social interaction. Effect sizes (ES) provided a descriptive measure of the change in outcomes. SETTING: Outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation clinic. PATIENTS: Forty-six patients with definite chronic progressive MS; 20 received treatment and 26 were in a nontreatment comparison group ("waiting list"). INTERVENTION: Rehabilitation services for 5 hours, 1 day per week, over 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The MS-Related Symptom Checklist composite score, fatigue frequency, and selected items from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago Functional Assessment Scale. RESULTS: Receiving treatment was a significant predictor of reduced symptom frequency (partial r2 = .26) at the 1-year follow-up. The ES adjusted for baseline values indicated substantial reductions in symptom frequency for the treatment group (EStreatment = .27 vs ESwaitlist = -.32). Fatigue was significantly reduced at the time of follow-up for the treatment group compared with the waiting list group (EStreatment = .46 vs ESwaitlist = -.20). There were no statistically significant differences among groups regarding functional status, but there appeared to be less loss of functional status in the treatment group compared with the waiting list group (EStreatment = -.07 vs ESwaitlist = -.70). CONCLUSIONS: An extended outpatient rehabilitation program for persons with definite progressive MS appears to effectively reduce fatigue and the severity of other symptoms associated with MS.

TI  - Frontal lobe hypometabolism and depression in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - Depression is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinicoanatomic studies in focal brain injuries and functional imaging studies both in primary depression and in depression secondary to neurologic diseases have demonstrated involvement of the frontal lobe. Frontal involvement has not been established in the depression of AD. We studied the correlation between focal brain metabolic abnormalities and depression in AD. In 53 patients with probable AD of minimal to moderate disability, we assessed the severity of depression using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and correlated the depression score with regional cerebral glucose metabolism determined by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and PET. Depression was present in 19 patients (36%). The depression score correlated significantly with normalized glucose metabolic rates in the bilateral superior frontal and left anterior cingulate cortices. These results indicated an association between depression and decreased activity in the frontal lobe in AD and support frontal involvement, especially in the left side, in depression, irrespective of disease etiology.

TI  - Personality, depression, and premorbid lifestyle in twin pairs discordant for Parkinson's disease.  
AB  - Present personality traits (Freiburg personality inventory, FPI-R), depression (von Zerssen's depression scale), and self assessed state of health were evaluated in 15 twin pairs (six monozygotic and nine dizygotic; mean age 62.5 years) discordant for idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in 17 unrelated healthy control subjects. The twins had additional questionnaire based interviews on premorbid lifestyle. For disability, twins with Parkinson's disease scored lower on FPI-R than controls in "achievement orientation" and "extraversion", higher in "inhibitedness", "somatic complaints", and "emotionality". They scored higher for depression and for state of health than unaffected twins and controls. For zygosity, monozygotic twins scored lower than dizygotic twins in "achievement orientation", "aggressiveness", and "strain". Monozygotic twins had less "achievement orientation" and "extraversion" and more "somatic complaints" than controls. Monozygotic twins had a lower within pair difference than dizygotic twins in "social orientation". During premorbid times the affected twin with later Parkinson's disease was estimated to have been "less often the leader" in the twin pair. Although small in sample size, this twin study indicates a genetic impact for some personality features beyond the Parkinson's disease motor syndrome.

TI  - The effect of gender and age at onset of depression on mortality.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression has a marked negative impact on geriatric patient mortality and morbidity. The risk factors and exact reasons for these effects are not well understood. METHOD: Seeking to better define the factors, we retrospectively analyzed the effects of gender and age at onset of affective disorder in a naturalistic study of 192 geriatric patients consecutively admitted to a large midwestern tertiary care center between 1980 and 1987 for the treatment of unipolar depression. RESULTS: After controlling for age at index admission, patients with an onset of depression before age 40 suffered significantly (p < .05) less mortality in follow-up than those with onset after age 40. When effects of gender are examined, the effects of age at onset are most profound in women, with a threefold increase in the rate of death in the cohort with age at onset of depression after 70 years when compared to those with onset before age 40. CONCLUSION: These results and those of others suggest that depressed elderly women with no previous history of affective disorder are at a markedly increased risk compared with elderly women with a history of affective illness for morbidity and mortality and that a significant proportion of elderly depressed patients are admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a depression that is secondary to serious medical illness.

TI  - The effect of propranolol intoxication on QTc interval in a canine model.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of propranolol intoxication on the QT and QTc intervals in a canine model. Lead II surface electrocardiograms were retrospectively evaluated from a previous study performed in this laboratory. Thirteen pentobarbital-anesthetized and instrumented animals, after a 30-min baseline period, were given 10 mg/kg dl-propranolol i.v. over 10 min. The electrocardiogram was printed continuously. Average heart rate and QT interval were measured and QTc was calculated at baseline and again 1 min after propranolol infusion was complete. Data for hemodynamic parameters have been previously reported demonstrating significant cardiovascular depression in all animals and one death with the administration of propranol. The QT interval was significantly prolonged by propranolol administration from baseline at 0.257 +/- 0.039 to 0.295 +/- 0.035 s. There was no significant difference in the QTc between baseline (0.371 +/- 0.026 s) and postpropranolol (0.366 +/- 0.021 s) measurements. In this canine model of propranolol intoxication, QT interval prolongation appears to be the result of associated bradycardia. Cardiovascular depression does not appear to include a significant direct effect on ventricular repolarization, as judged by the QTc interval.

TI  - Major depression: behavioral parameters of depression and recovery.  
AB  - This paper reports on an ethological study of 11 depressed hospitalized subjects. Major depression and recovery are described in terms of general behavioral traits, i.e., behavior parameters. The hypothesis, that the primary behavioral feature of major depression is a reduction of social interaction and that secondary features are reduced self occupation and body mobility (posture flexibility) is tested. The behavioral patterns of depression and recovery are described and elucidated by 12 defined behavioral parameters, eight of which show significant changes between the first and the last hospital week. Findings from six of the parameters are consistent with the hypothesis and demonstrate social inhibition during depression; interactions between depression and nonverbal behavior are particularly striking. Findings also confirm that, during depression, self occupation and body mobility are reduced to a less significant degree than social inhibition. Possible relationships between findings and agitated forms of major depression are discussed. A final section examines findings in an evolutionary context and emphasizes their clinical implications.

TI  - Urinary free cortisol excretion in chronic fatigue syndrome, major depression and in healthy volunteers.  
AB  - Urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was compared in 21 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), in 10 melancholic depressives and in 15 healthy controls. Patients with depression had UFC values which were significantly higher than healthy comparison subjects, whereas UFC excretion of CFS patients was significantly lower than the comparison group. These findings are in keeping with currently held hypotheses of hyperactivity and hypoactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depression and chronic fatigue syndrome respectively. Five of the 21 CFS patients had a co-morbid depressive illness. This sub-group retained the profile of UFC excretion of those with CFS alone, suggesting a different pathophysiological basis for depressive symptoms in CFS.

TI  - The epidemiology of affective disorders in the elderly: a review.  
AB  - It has been suggested that elderly people are predisposed to depression by age-related structural and biochemical changes that may increase their vulnerability to depression and by the fact that risk factors such as bereavement and other psychological losses, somatic diseases and institutionalization become more common with increasing age. The elderly also have a disproportionately high rate of suicide. Whether the prevalence of depression increases or decreases with age is, however, debatable. There may be a peak in the prevalence during the years before retirement, a low prevalence during the first 10-15 years thereafter, and an increase after the age of 75 years. Among the consequences of depression are social deprivation, loneliness, poor quality of life, increased use of health and home-care services, cognitive decline, impairments in activities of daily living, chronicity, suicide and increased non-suicide mortality. However, most studies report that few depressives in the community are treated with antidepressants. During recent years new antidepressants have been introduced, which are better tolerated by the elderly. At the same time, the prescription of anti-depressants has increased in the community. It remains to be seen whether these changes have led to a higher rate of treatment of depression in the elderly.

TI  - Life events, difficulties and depression among women in an urban setting in Zimbabwe.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous paper (Abas & Broadhead, 1997) reported that among 172 women randomly selected from a Zimbabwean township 30.8% had a depressive or anxiety disorder during the previous year. Compared with London, the higher annual prevalence of disorders in Harare could mostly be accounted for by an excess of onset cases in the study year (annual incidence of depression 18%). This paper reports on the role of life events and difficulties in the aetiology of depression among these women. METHOD: Randomly selected women (N = 172) from a township in Harare were interviewed with a Zimbabwean modification of the Bedford College Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS). RESULTS: Events and difficulties proved critical in provoking the onset of depression in Harare. Far more events occurring in Harare were severe or disruptive. Furthermore, a proportion of the Harare severe events were more threatening than have been described in London. As in London, certain types of severe event were particularly depressogenic, i.e. those involving the woman's humiliation, her entrapment in an ongoing difficult situation, or bereavement. However, more severe events in Harare involved these specific dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a common mechanism for the development of depression, as defined by international criteria, between Zimbabwe and London. The high frequency of severe events, and their especially adverse qualities, offer an explanation for the high incidence of depression in Harare.

TI  - Predicting depression in women: the role of past and present vulnerability.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study, covering just over a 1-year period, sought to confirm an earlier finding that around 40% of women who experience a severe life event in the presence of two ongoing psychosocial vulnerability factors, (negative close relationships and low self-esteem) will develop a major depressive episode. Distal risk factors were examined to see if they improved prediction. METHODS: A population sample of 105 mainly working-class mothers with vulnerability and without depression were interviewed three times over a 14-month period to date the occurrence of severe life events and onset of major depression. Degree of vulnerability was assessed at first contact together with distal risk in terms of childhood neglect/abuse and any earlier episodes of depression. RESULTS: Thirty-seven per cent of these vulnerable women became depressed in the study period. The majority experienced a severe life event, and of these, 48% had onsets. Contrary to expectation, risk was only a little less among those with just one of the two vulnerability factors. Two-thirds of women with an onset had been depressed in previous years. Although this was associated with increased risk, the effect was greatest for those who had experienced an episode before age 20. A relationship between childhood neglect/abuse and onset was entirely accounted for by such early depression. CONCLUSION: An aetiological model of depression outlined in earlier research was confined with a new factor of teenage depression shown to increase risk of onset.

TI  - The structure of depression among elderly institution residents: affective and somatic correlates of physical frailty.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Confounding of depression with somatic illness and anxiety, a problem in any age group, may be especially troublesome in frail older persons. This paper examined this problem in a factor analytic study of the structure of depressive symptomatology, identifying affective and somatic symptom clusters and relating those clusters to health and functional variables cross-sectionally and prospectively over a 1-year interval. METHODS: The factor structure of a DSM-IV symptom checklist was examined among 1,245 elderly long-term care residents. Regression analyses examined the association of resulting factors with cognition, functional disability, self- and physician-rated health, and pain at baseline and a year later. One-year mortality was also examined. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed three unique symptom clusters: depressed mood, somatic symptoms, and psychic anxiety. Depressed mood and somatic symptoms were associated cross-sectionally with all functional health variables, but psychic anxiety was associated only with pain. Longitudinally, depressed mood was the only independent predictor of decline in cognition, functional ability, physician-rated health, and mortality; the last effect, however, did not withstand control for baseline health and functioning. Somatic symptoms at baseline predicted decrement in self-rated health a year later. Effects varied as a function of cognitive status. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that concerns about the confounding role of somatic symptoms in the association of depression with physical health are unfounded. Although somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with health and functional status cross-sectionally, depressed mood was by far the stronger predictor of health declines over time.

TI  - Social phobia: an update.  
AB  - The literature on social phobia is reviewed in this article. Social phobia has undergone considerable diagnostic evolution to reach its present form in DSM-IV. Its differential diagnosis includes panic disorder with agoraphobia, avoidant personality disorder, depression, and "shyness." Cross-cultural issues are important to consider because the disorder may manifest differently in different cultures and social settings. It is common, with a lifetime prevalence of 13.3% in the United States according to recent epidemiological studies. Underrecognition of social phobia remains an issue of concern. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, including other anxiety disorders, depression, alcohol abuse, and personality disorders, frequently occurs. Current conceptualizations of the etiology of social phobia reflect psychodynamic theories and evidence from family and genetic studies, neurobiological research, and neuroimaging. Drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and beta3-adrenergic blockers have proven to be efficacious, as has cognitive-behavioral treatment, including group approaches.

AB  - Ethylene glycol poisoning is an important toxicological problem in medical practice because early diagnosis and treatment can prevent considerable morbidity and mortality. When ingested in the form of antifreeze or other automotive products, ethylene glycol results in central nervous system depression, cardiopulmonary compromise, and renal insufficiency. Metabolism of ethylene glycol to organic acids is required for metabolic derangement and organ damage. Laboratory features of ethylene glycol poisoning include increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolal gap, calcium oxalate crystalluria, and detectable ethylene glycol in serum. This Case Conference integrates discussion of the toxicokinetic and analytical variables that affect the laboratory diagnosis of ethylene glycol intoxication.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of depression in late life.  
AB  - Major depression and dysthymia are common and often disabling disorders in late life. Several features of late-life depression, such as its frequent association with general medical conditions, polypharmacy, cognitive disturbances, and adverse life events, make accurate diagnosis a substantial clinical challenge. Yet, prompt diagnosis is an important component of implementing appropriate treatment strategies. An ideal treatment program integrates patient and family education, focused psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. Because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes associated with aging, lower doses of medication and more gradual dose increases than are required in younger adults are needed in the treatment of elderly depressed patients. In addition, medications should be selected that have minimal antihistaminic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic effects, minimal cardiovascular risk, and minimal drug-drug interactions. Since depression in late life tends to be at least as chronic and/or recurrent as depression earlier in life, treatment for acute depressive episodes should last at least 6-8 months, and long-term maintenance treatment should be considered in selected individuals.

TI  - Psychosocial antecedents of depressive symptoms: an evaluation using daily experiences methodology.  
AB  - College students provided ratings regarding the intensity of depressive symptoms every day for 45 consecutive days. Participants also made daily ratings of the degree to which they experienced 3 psychosocial processes that have been theoretically linked to depression: dependency, negative cognitions, and interpersonal stress. Concomitant time-series analyses revealed significant temporal covariation of each psychosocial variable, with depressive symptoms for virtually all participants. Across-time analyses also revealed that elevations in interpersonal stress and feelings of dependency preceded, by 1 day, the onset of periods of intense depression, and that elevations in all 3 psychosocial variables were apparent 1 to 2 days after such episodes had ended. The findings suggest that a "daily experiences methodology" may be useful in identifying short-term antecedents and residuals of symptomatic states.

AB  - This study compared depressive and anxious symptoms in chronic medically ill individuals and depressed psychiatric inpatients using conceptually based standardized measures of cognitions and symptoms. Seventy-five hospitalized medical patients, 52 depressed psychiatric inpatients, and 25 normal controls were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987), the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, Hamilton Rating Scales of Anxiety and Depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales, Beck Depression Inventory, Cognitions Checklist, and Hopelessness Scale. Analysis revealed that depression in medical patients was best distinguished by symptoms of anhedonia, low positive affect, and physiological hyperarousal, whereas syndromal depression in psychiatric inpatients was specifically characterized by negative cognition symptoms. Implications are discussed for assessing depression in medically ill populations.

TI  - [Contribution of soft tissue trauma and/or bone fracture to immune suppression after hemorrhagic shock in the animal experiment]  
AB  - Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised. Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting. To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35 +/- 5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice. All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.  More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage. The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i.e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function. Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity. This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage. The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.

AB  - Of 15 patients with fibromyalgia who were first evaluated for the presence of Axis I psychiatric diagnoses by use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, 11 completed an open 8-week trial with the novel antidepressant venlafaxine. Six (55%) of 11 completers experienced a > or = 50% reduction of fibromyalgia symptoms. The presence of lifetime psychiatric disorders, particularly depressive and anxiety disorders, predicted a positive response to venlafaxine. These findings suggest that it is important to assess for comorbid psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia and that venlafaxine may be helpful to some of these patients.

The use of pharmacological agents that interfere with the nitric oxide pathway, such as L-arginine (precursor of nitric oxide), D-arginine (non-precursor of nitric oxide) N(omega_-nitro-L-arginine and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase), and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (nitric oxide scavenger), demonstrated that nitric oxide modulated this depression phenomenon by exerting a dual effect on the nicotinic activation, i.e. facilitation or inhibition.

TI  - Nerve-induced release of nitric oxide exerts dual effects on nicotinic transmission within the coeliac ganglion in the rabbit.  
AB  - The involvement of nitric oxide in the modulation of nicotinic activation was investigated in vitro in isolated rabbit coeliac ganglion. The electrical activity of the ganglionic neurons was recorded using intracellular recording techniques. When a train of pulses of supramaximum intensity was applied to the splanchnic nerves, gradual depression of fast nicotinic activation occurred: the pulses do not systematically elicit action potentials, but very often elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials only. This phenomenon appeared between 15 and 20 Hz and increased with the frequency of stimulation. It was not related to any change in the membrane potential of the ganglionic neurons. For a given frequency, the depression appeared progressively and it was particularly strong at the end of the train. The use of pharmacological agents that interfere with the nitric oxide pathway, such as L-arginine (precursor of nitric oxide), D-arginine (non-precursor of nitric oxide) N(omega_-nitro-L-arginine and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase), and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (nitric oxide scavenger), demonstrated that nitric oxide modulated this depression phenomenon by exerting a dual effect on the nicotinic activation, i.e. facilitation or inhibition. Agents interfering with the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate pathway, such as oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (selective inhibitor of the nitric oxide-activated soluble guanylate cyclase) and zaprinast (selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterases involved in the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate pathway) demonstrated that only the facilitatory effect of nitric oxide on the nicotinic activation was mediated through the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate pathway. The mechanism sustaining the inhibitory effect remains to be determined. By modulating the nicotinic activation, nitric oxide plays a role in the integrative properties of the prevertebral ganglia. This opens new perspectives with regard to the control of visceral functions by the prevertebral level of regulation.

TI  - Late-life suicide and depression in the primary care setting.  
AB  -  Late-life depression and suicidal behavior in the primary care setting is a significant public health concern. The prevalence of depression in this population is substantial, yet rates of detection and treatment are far from adequate. Untreated depression has significant consequences with regard to morbidity and mortality. Although suicide is a relatively low-base-rate behavior, a substantial proportion of late-life suicides have contact with their primary care provider prior to their death; thus this offers an avenue for suicide prevention. There is a growing knowledge base concerning what constitutes barriers to the recognition and treatment of late-life depression as well as what constitutes useful screening tools and treatments for the depressed elderly. Important new findings with regard to the functional effects of subsyndromal depression, possible subtypes of late-life depression, the clinical utility of SSRIs and psychotherapeutic interventions, and innovative and collaborative models of care hold promise for advancing the science and practice of treating late-life depression.

TI  -  Depression, developmental level and disclosure in sexually abused children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between sexual abuse disclosure, developmental level and psychopathology in children. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of case records, using chi-square and t-tests for statistical significance. SETTING: Child and Adolescent Unit, Midlands Hospital, Pietermaritzburg. SUBJECTS: One hundred children consecutively admitted for all types of mental health problems. OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic evaluations were made using the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd edition, revised). RESULTS: Forty of the 100 children had been sexually abused, but 14 (35%) of the abused children did not disclose their abuse until after admission. The post-admission disclosure group had a significantly higher mean age (13.71 years) than the pre-admission disclosure group (10.96 years). Also, significantly more post-admission disclosure children received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder than their pre-admission disclosure counterparts. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the issue of sexual abuse disclosure and its relationship to depression and developmental level. Internal psychological and developmental mechanisms appear to influence the disclosure/non-disclosure of sexual abuse.

TI  - Treatment of depression in elderly patients: recent advances.  
AB  - Although sometimes difficult to diagnose because of concurrent stressors, medical illness, or dementia, depression in elderly patients responds readily to appropriate therapy. When untreated, this disorder may result in increased morbidity and mortality or suicide. Effective therapeutic options for late-life depression, as in younger patients, include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Short-term, highly focused forms of psychotherapy are helpful for elderly patients who are reluctant or unable to tolerate antidepressant medication. Because of their favorable adverse effect profiles and safety in cases of overdose, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have, in most cases, replaced tricyclic antidepressants as first-line therapy when antidepressants are indicated. Psychostimulants may be helpful for medically ill elderly patients with depressive symptoms. Finally, electroconvulsive therapy offers a safe and effective alternative for patients refractory to or unable to tolerate antidepressant medication.

TI  - The effects of depression and abnormal illness behaviour on outcome following rehabilitation from stroke.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative effects of depression and abnormal illness behaviour (AIB) on long-term rehabilitation outcome following stroke. DESIGN: A longitudinal design, with assessments on admission to and discharge from rehabilitation, and six and twelve months after discharge. SETTING: The study was undertaken in the rehabilitation unit at Repatriation General Hospital, in Adelaide, South Australia. SUBJECTS: Ninety-four twelve-month stroke survivors who had undergone an inpatient rehabilitation programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AIB was assessed using the Illness Behaviour Questionnaire, and depression with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. The General Health Questionnaire and a visual analogue mood scale were also used. Functional outcome was assessed with the competence and performance assessments of the Australian ADL Index, and lifestyle activities with the Frenchay Activities Index. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of outcome controlled for age and stroke severity. AIB was a better predictor of functional competence and performance than either age or stroke severity, at rehabilitation discharge and both six and twelve months later.  Depression was not related to functional competence and performance at any assessment, but was strongly predictive of an inactive lifestyle at both six and twelve months. By contrast, lifestyle activities were not related to AIB. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and AIB appear to have quite distinct effects on outcome. AIB emerged as a key determinant of long-term functional disability, while depression was associated with poorer social functioning. The early recognition and treatment of AIB and depression is important for the ultimate social and functional outcomes of stroke rehabilitation patients.

TI  - [Prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome in 4 family practices in Leiden]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in general practice. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: General practice and primary health care centres in Leyden region, the Netherlands. METHOD: RNUH-LEO is a computerized database which contains the anonymous patient information of one general practice (with two practitioners) and four primary health care centres. The fourteen participating general practitioners were asked what International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) code they used to indicate a patient with chronic fatigue or with CFS. With these codes and with the code for depression patients were selected from the database. It then was determined whether these patients met the criteria of CFS by Holmes et al. RESULTS: The general practitioners used 10 codes. Including the code for depression a total of 601 patients were preselected from a total of 23,000 patients in the database. Based on the information from the patients' records in the database, 42 of the preselected patients were selected who might fulfill the Holmes' criteria of CFS. According to the patients' own general practitioner, 25 of the 42 patients would fulfil the Holmes' criteria. The men:women ratio was 1:5. The prevalence of CFS in the population surveyed was estimated to be at least 1.1 per 1,000 patients.

TI  - The impact of depression on the outcome of addictions treatment.  
AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence and presentation of depression among patients with substance use disorders, and to explore the relationship between depression and the outcome of addictions treatment. Seventy-five patients were consecutively recruited upon entering addictions treatment, and were assessed by clinical and semi-structured interviews, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Global Assessment Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. At intake, 22.4% of patients had primary depressive disorders, 8.4% had substance-induced depressions, and 5.6% had mixed features of primary and substance-induced depressions. Female and alcoholic patients were more likely to suffer from both primary and substance-induced depressions. At 3 months, 93.3% of patients were reinterviewed. Depressed patients had longer duration of abstinence and greater decreases in symptomatology. Patients with substance-induced depression achieved almost complete discontinuation of primary substance use.  Depression had a significant impact on addictions treatment outcome, but many important predictors of outcome have not yet been identified.

TI  - Family structure and depressive symptoms in men preceding and following the birth of a child. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood Study Team.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence and etiology of pre- and postpartum depressive symptoms in women in a variety of family forms have been well documented, but relatively little research has been conducted on the adjustment of their male partners. The authors' goals in this study were 1) to estimate rates of depression during the pregnancy and 8 weeks following the birth of a child in a large representative community sample of fathers in different family structures and 2) to explore the role of stressful life events, social and emotional support, the quality of the partner relationship, and socioeconomic circumstances. METHOD: This study describes the relations of family setting and other correlates to men's depressive symptoms during the pregnancies (18 weeks gestation, on average) and 8 weeks after the births of children for 7,018 partners of female participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood. RESULTS: Men living in stepfamilies had-significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms before and after the birth than did men in more traditional families. The effect of stepfamily status on depression was mediated by education, life events, social support, social network, and level of aggression in the partnership. CONCLUSIONS: There are similarities in the patterns and correlates of depression after the birth of a child for men and women. These findings point to the importance of family and partnership ecology in the adjustment of men before and after the birth of a child.

TI  - An evaluation of practice nurses working with general practitioners to treat people with depression [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of depression constitutes a significant component of a general practitioner's workload. A pilot study has suggested that the practice nurse may have an important contribution to make in the care of patients with depression. AIM: To evaluate an extended role for practice nurses in improving the outcome of depression through two specially-designed interviews running in parallel. METHOD: Two naturalistic, random allocation studies took place concurrently over four months. Study 1 evaluated the effectiveness of standardized psychiatric assessment by a practice nurse and feedback of information to the general practitioner (GP). Study 2 evaluated the above assessment and feedback combined with nurse-assisted follow-up care. Twenty general practices participating in the Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework took part in the study. Subjects included general practice attenders identified as depressed by their GP. The main outcome measures were a change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and in the proportion of patients fulfilling DSM-III criteria for major depression. RESULTS: A total of 577 patients were recruited; 516 [89% (95% CI = 86-92%)] were rated as depressed on the BDI and 474 [82% (95% CI = 79-85%)] met criteria for DSM-III major depression. Altogether, 524 (91%) patients completed follow-up at four months. All groups of patients showed improvement, but no difference in the rate of improvement was shown for the nurse intervention groups. BDI mean scores fell from 18.54 (95% CI = 17.53-20.06) to 11.53 (95% CI = 10.02-13.04) in Study 1, and from 21.01 (95% = CI 20.26-21.86) to 10.62 (95% CI = 9.73-11.51) in Study 2. The proportion of patients fulfilling criteria for DSM-III major depression in Study 1 fell from 80% (95% CI = 73-87%) to 30% (95% CI = 22-38%), and in Study 2 from 80% (95% CI = 76-84%) to 27% (95% CI = 23-31%). Prescription rates of antidepressant medication were higher than expected, ranging between 63% and 76% in the two studies. CONCLUSION: There was an increase in the rate of antidepressant prescription, but no additional benefit could be adduced for patients who received a nurse intervention.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of CQI teams and academic detailing: can they alter compliance with guidelines?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of clinical guidelines in isolation has generally failed to promote voluntary change in practice patterns. Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) techniques and continuous quality improvement (CQI) teams in increasing compliance with national guidelines for the primary care of hypertension and depression. METHODS: Fifteen small group practices at four Seattle primary care clinics were assigned to one of three study arms--AD alone, AD plus CQI teams, or usual care. The activity of 95 providers and 4,995 patients was monitored from August 1, 1993, through January 31, 1996. Twelve-month baseline and study periods were separated by a six-month "wash-in" period during which training sessions were held. Changes in hypertension prescribing, blood pressure control, depression recognition, use of older tricyclics, and scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale were examined. RESULTS: Clinics varied considerably in their implementation of both the AD and the CQI team interventions. Across all sites, AD was associated with change in a single process measure, a decline in the percentage of depressives prescribed first-generation tricyclics (-4.7 percentage points versus control, p = 0.04). No intervention effects were demonstrated for CQI teams across all sites for either disease condition. Within the clinic independently judged most successful at implementing both change strategies, the use of CQI teams and AD in combination did increase the percentage of hypertensives adequately controlled (17.3 percentage points versus control, p = 0.03). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The AD techniques and the CQI teams evaluated were generally ineffective in improving guideline compliance and clinical outcomes regarding the primary care of hypertension and depression.

TI  - A follow-up of enuresis from childhood to adolescence.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and treatment of enuresis in a national population-based follow-up study of children aged 8-14 years, to evaluate possible factors that enhance or hamper the attainment of continence and to examine the relationships between enuresis and psychiatric disturbance. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An initial study was carried out in 1989 as part of the Finnish Child Psychiatric National Epidemiological Study. Three types of questionnaires were used; the Rutter Scale A for completion by parents, including a question about enuresis, the Rutter scale B for completion by teachers and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), completed by the children. Parents were also asked about demographic and family issues, teachers about school achievements and children about additional psychosomatic symptoms. In a follow-up in 1995, the target population comprised all previous enuretics and their controls, matched by age, gender, class and school, in the first phase of the study. Replies were received from 315 enuretic boys and 186 girls, with the corresponding values for controls being 310 and 183. The parents were asked about the adolescents' present enuresis and for permission for a treatment trial, if needed. The adolescents completed the CDI, and a questionnaire about enuresis, previous treatments and possible willingness for a treatment trial. They also reported basic somatic data, their life events and living habits. RESULTS: In the initial study, the enuretic children had higher total and subscores as reported by parents, teachers and themselves, except for emotional items reported by the teachers. Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of these children soiled, had sleeping difficulties and difficulties in falling asleep. Enuretic boys had more frequent nightly arousal and early morning waking, while the enuretic girls had more nightmares than non-enuretic girls. At 14 years old, the parents reported that 13 adolescents were enuretic; from the children's replies, nine boys and seven girls were enuretic. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of enuresis in those previously enuretic was surprisingly low, probably because of the efficient treatment methods, conditioning and medication. There were evident connections between childhood enuresis and mental well-being.

TI  - Eclamptic plasma stimulates norepinephrine release in cultured sympathetic nerve.  
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of plasma from eclamptic and preeclamptic patients on cultured sympathetic nerve. Sympathetic neurons from 12- to 14-day-old chick embryos were cultured; the neurons were then stimulated with 50% plasma from eclamptic, preeclamptic, hypertensive, normotensive pregnant, hypertensive, and normotensive nonpregnant women (n=7). Similarly, neurons were individually incubated with mixtures of 50% corresponding plasma with 0.25% bupivacaine or bupivacaine only (n=7). Furthermore, the effects of 1%, 10%, and 50% plasma from eclamptic, preeclamptic, and normotensive pregnant patients (n=7) were also evaluated. Norepinephrine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Electron microscopic studies of nerve cells were also performed. Stimulation with plasma from eclamptic and preeclamptic women significantly increased norepinephrine concentration (P<0.0001) compared with control. The release of norepinephrine was found to be concentration-dependent. Conversely, norepinephrine secretion was significantly hampered by bupivacaine treatment (P<0.0001). Electron microscopic studies in eclamptic and preeclamptic plasma-stimulated nerve cells showed that perikarya were in close contact with each other and with nerve cell processes. After treatment with bupivacaine, nerve cells were irregular in shape and the cell membranes were demyelinated. These results suggest that eclamptic and preeclamptic plasma has an excitotoxic effect on sympathetic nerve via axoplasmic membrane depolarization, thus increasing norepinephrine secretion that is blocked by bupivacaine. A preeclamptic condition may be improved by depression of sympathetic nerve stimulation.

TI  - Suicide and antidepressants.  
AB  - Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are an integral part of various depressions. Suicide attempts are common in major depression but even more common in recurrent brief depression, and the rate is further increased when these depressions occur comorbidly. Combined depression, where recurrent brief depression and major depression coexist, is the strongest clinical predictor of suicide attempts in the literature. There have been very few controlled studies of treatments for depression in high-risk groups of suicide attempters. Psychotherapy has been found to significantly raise the suicide attempt rate compared with conventional treatment, whereas fluoxetine and mianserin were not different from placebo. The only treatment that has been found to lower the suicide attempt rate in those with a history of previous suicide attempts is low doses of flupenthixol, a neuroleptic licensed for depression in Europe. This drug had a significant advantage compared with placebo in a six-month study. There are indications from large studies that maprotiline and amitriptyline might raise the suicide attempt rate, compared with placebo or other antidepressants, independent of their inherent toxicity in overdose. Several analyses of coroners' data show that tricyclic antidepressants are associated with high and unacceptable death rates in overdose compared with SSRIs and other safer antidepressants. Toxic antidepressants should be avoided in those thought to be at particular risk.

TI  - Psychosocial adjustment among Central American immigrants with disabilities: an exploratory study.  
AB  - This is an exploratory study that investigated factors influencing the psychosocial adjustment of Central American immigrants with disabilities. The relationships between stress, and perception of disability severity and (a) depression and (b) anxiety were assessed. Furthermore, this study investigated whether social support moderated the impact of stress and severity of disability on depression and anxiety. Stress, severity of disability, and social support explained a high percentage (54%) of the variance in depression. High levels of stress, increased perceptions of severity of disability, and low social support were associated with increased depression. The interactions between support and stress and between support and disability severity did not significantly add to the original model which predicted depression. Main effects were found for stress, disability severity, and the interaction between support and disability severity. Stress and social support significantly accounted for 31% of the variance in anxiety. Increased stress and decreased social support were associated with greater levels of anxiety. The interaction between support and stress did not significantly predict anxiety. Implications of the study in terms of future research and intervention programs targeting mental health outcomes for Latino immigrants with disabilities are discussed.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus and depression in drug users.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical case studies have implicated depression as a possible side-effect of interferon treatment for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, because these studies generally did not include a pretreatment assessment of depression, it cannot be definitively stated whether depression is a side-effect of interferon treatment, a syndrome coexisting with HCV, or a common characteristic of individuals who are vulnerable to HCV infection. To gather more information about this issue, self-reported depressive symptomatology of drug users with HCV who have not received interferon treatment was compared to that of uninfected drug users. METHODS: Subjects were 309 drug users not currently in substance abuse treatment who were participating in a National Institute on Drug Abuse project. Subjects completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) instrument and provided a blood sample for HCV testing. RESULTS: Serological findings revealed that 52.4% of the subjects tested positive for HCV antibodies. Of the HCV-positive subjects, 57.2% had significant depressive symptomatology, whereas only 48.2% of the HCV-negative subjects did, for an overall rate of 52.6%. The two groups also differed on two specific dimensions of depression, with the HCV-positive group scoring lower on the Positive Affect scale and higher on the Somatic/Retarded Activity scale. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal high levels of depressive symptomatology among drug users, as well as the possibility of a coexisting depressive syndrome with HCV infection. These findings raise the possibility that depression associated with interferon treatment may, at least partially, be accounted for by preexisting depression. Further research is needed to determine the nature and origins of depression in individuals in treatment with interferon for HCV with specific focus placed on determining the dimensions of depression associated with HCV infection and interferon treatment.

TI  - Inactivation of antithrombin III in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the thrombin inhibitory capacity of antithrombin III in the inflamed human joint. METHODS: Thrombin inhibitory capacity was measured, using a kinetic spectophotometric method, in matched plasma and synovial fluid samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 22) and osteoarthritis (n = 16), together with normal control plasma samples (n = 13). In the same samples, the concentration of antithrombin III was also determined by the method of radial immunodiffusion. The combination of these measurements allowed the calculation of the specific thrombin inhibitory capacity of these samples. RESULTS: An increased concentration of antithrombin III in rheumatoid compared with osteoarthritic synovial fluid was noted (p < 0.05). However, there was a significant depression in the specific activity of antithrombin III in rheumatoid synovial fluid when compared with matched plasma samples (p < 0.001) or with osteoarthritic synovial fluid (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In rheumatoid synovial fluid the thrombin inhibitory capacity of antithrombin III is disproportionately depressed relative to the concentration of antithrombin III, indicating the inactivation of antithrombin III in the rheumatoid joint.

TI  - Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy for smokers with histories of alcohol dependence and depression.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alcohol dependence and major depression have been associated with heavy cigarette use and poor smoking-treatment outcomes. This preliminary study examined the efficacy of a mood management intervention for smoking cessation in abstinent alcoholics with a history of major depression. METHOD: Participants were 29 (15 female, 14 male) heavy smokers (mean cigs/day = 30.2), with an average of 6.8 years of continuous abstinence from alcohol and drugs, randomized to behavioral counseling (BC) (n = 16) or behavioral counseling + cognitive-behavioral mood management (CBT) (n = 13). A 2 x 5 repeated measures design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions on smoking outcome at baseline, posttreatment and at 1-, 3- and 12-month-follow-up. Self-reported smoking status was verified with biochemical (COa) and informant report. RESULTS: Verified self-report indicated that significantly more smokers in CBT quit by posttreatment (69.2%; 9 of 13) than in BC (31.3%; 5 of 16) (chi2 = 4.14, 1 df, p = .04). These abstinence rates remained unchanged at 1-month follow-up. At 3-month follow-up, differences in smoking abstinence rates were nonsignificant between CBT (46.2%; 6 of 13) and BC (25.0%; 4 of 16) conditions. However, at 12-month follow-up, significantly more participants in CBT were abstinent from smoking (46.2%; 6 of 13) than in BC (12.5%; 2 of 16) (chi2 = 4.07, 1 df, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that interventions focused on managing negative mood may benefit these high-risk, comorbid smokers.

CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to some other work, rates of dexamethasone non-suppression were very low; together with the high rates of depression, this suggests that depression in schizophrenia may have a different neuroendocrine profile from major depressive disorders.

TI  - The dexamethasone suppression test in schizophrenia.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cortisol non-suppression following the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has been found to a variable extent in schizophrenia. The aetiology is unclear but may be related to depression or negative symptoms. METHODS: The DST was administered to 64 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia. All patients were screened for DSM-IV major depression and rated on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). RESULTS: DSM-IV criteria for major depression was fulfilled by 36% of the patients and 42% of patients had a history of parasuicide. Four patients had undetectable levels of dexamethasone and were excluded from the endocrine analyses. Only one remaining patient had a cortisol level above the cut-off point (> 138 nmol/l), indicating escape from dexamethasone suppression. The post-dexamethasone cortisol level correlated significantly with HRSD and BPRS scores but not with the SANS. The SANS and HRSD scores were not correlated, but they were independently correlated with the BPRS score. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to some other work, rates of dexamethasone non-suppression were very low; together with the high rates of depression, this suggests that depression in schizophrenia may have a different neuroendocrine profile from major depressive disorders. Failure to measure dexamethasone levels can be misleading.

TI  - Self-reported mental distress under the shifting daylight in the high north.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The validity of the concept of seasonal affective disorder and the causal link to lack of daylight in winter is controversial. There is a need for investigations in large samples of the general population at different latitudes and within general research contexts to avoid selective response bias and sensitization of the population. METHODS: During a study of health effects of the air pollution from Russia in a small community at 70 degrees north, a self-administered questionnaire was filled in by 3736 inhabitants, 60.8% of the total population between 18 and 69 years. Three questions concerned depression, sleeping problems and other problems related to the two contrasting seasons with regard to daylight. RESULTS: Twenty-seven per cent reported to have some kind of problem in the dark period. Most frequently reported were sleeping problems during winter, in 19.9% of women and 11.2% of men.  Self-reported depression in winter was found in 11.1% of women and 4.8%% of men. Sleeping problems increased with age, while depression was most often reported by middle-aged people. The only other reported problem in winter was fatigue. The adjusted relative risk (RR) for winter depression in women compared to men was 2.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.9-3.2). Very few had problems in summer. CONCLUSIONS: In the high north, one-third of the women and one-fifth of the men experience problems with sleep, mood or energy related to season. The prevalence of self-reported depression was surprisingly low in winter considering the lack of daylight.

TI  - Fluoxetine in child and adolescent depression: acute and maintenance treatment.  
AB  - The objective was to present naturalistic 1-year follow-up information of 96 child and adolescent outpatients with major depressive disorder who had been randomized in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine. Subjects were children and adolescents, ages 8-18 years, who were entered in a randomized clinical trial of fluoxetine. Following the acute treatment trial, treatment was not controlled. At 6 months and 1 year, the subjects and parents were interviewed using the Kiddie Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (K-LIFE) for course of depression. Eighty-seven of the 96 subjects were followed for 1 year. Of these, 74 (85%) recovered from the depressive episode during that time (47 on fluoxetine, 22 on no medication, and 5 on other antidepressants or lithium). Twenty-nine of the subjects (39%) who recovered had a recurrence of depression during the 1-year follow-up, with 55% of these occurring within 6 months. Results of this study are similar to adult studies, with respect to response and recovery of depressive episodes. Most patients (85%) recover from the episode within 1 year, but approximately 40% have a recurrence within 12 months, which is a higher recurrence rate than in adults. Recovery was associated with younger age, lower severity of depressive symptoms, higher family functioning, and fewer comorbid diagnoses. Recurrence, which occurs both on and off medication, was difficult to predict, as there was little clinical data associated with recurrence in this population.

TI  - Some psychosocial aspects of nonlethal chondrodysplasias: II. Depression and anxiety.  
AB  - Individuals with chondrodysplasias may have disproportionate short stature and in some cases a distinctive facial appearance. These physical signs have the potential of affecting parent-child interactions and those of the dwarfed person with broader society.  Depression and anxiety are two psychological symptoms with potential for a major impact on a person's functioning within society. In this study depression and anxiety were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventories and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventories. While in general depression did not appear more likely in dwarfs than in the general population, comparison of adult patients with their unaffected sibs did raise some concern. Also, having an unaffected parent or spouse appeared to be associated with higher depression scores. Adult trait anxiety levels appeared higher, especially among women, than normally expected in the general population and when compared with their unaffected sibs.

TI  - Weight and survival depression in rodent bioassays with and without tumor decreases [published erratum appears in Toxicol Sci 1999 Mar;48(1):141-2]  
AB  - It has been suggested that the decreased tumor rates (anticarcinogenicity) commonly observed in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) rodent bioassays may be caused by compound-induced decreases in body weight or decreases in survival of treated animals. In this study, weight decrement and survival depression following chemical treatment was studied for those chemicals which induce site specific decreases in tumor rates (anticarcinogens) and those which do not (non-anticarcinogens) in a database of 312 chemicals tested in the NTP bioassay program prior to 1983. There is an evident difference in weight depression and animal survival between anticarcinogens and non-anticarcinogens but it is small relative to the variability between chemicals in the two groups. We argue that weight or survival depression cannot, in a simple way, explain the difference between anticarcinogenic and non-anticarcinogenic chemicals. In fact, there are a number of chemicals that are anticarcinogenic with no evidence of weight or survival depression and many chemicals that cause significant weight or survival decreases with no apparent anticarcinogenic effects. There is a small but statistically insignificant relationship between the degree of weight depression and the number of tumor sites found to have lower tumor rates in treated animals. These analyses suggest that biological factors other than weight and survival depression are involved in decreased tumor rates in rodent bioassays. These results, and those of the companion paper (I. Linkov et al., this issue), suggest that the anticarcinogenic responses observed in rodent cancer bioassays should be carefully considered in evaluations of the overall carcinogenic potential of chemicals.

TI  - Symptoms of depression and changes in body weight from adolescence to mid-life.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of symptoms of depression to weight changes in healthy individuals of normal weight across a follow-up of over 20 y. PARTICIPANTS AND DESIGN: College students (3885 men and 841 women) were administered a self-report depression measure in the mid-1960s. Their baseline body mass index (BMI) was calculated from their college medical records. Participants were contacted by mail in the late 1980s and asked to report their current height and weight as well as their smoking and exercise habits. Another measure of depressive symptoms was obtained from 3560 individuals at follow-up. Multiple regression models were used to relate changes in weight to depression scores while controlling for background (gender, baseline BMI and the gender by BMI interaction) and behavioral (exercise and smoking) predictors. RESULTS: The relationship between depressive symptoms and body weight change took the form of an interaction with baseline BMI (P < 0.001). Those with high baseline depression scores gained less weight than their nondepressed counterparts if they were initially lean, but more if they were initially heavy. This trend was especially strong in those with high depression scores at both baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the hypothesis that depression exaggerates pre-existing weight change tendencies. This pattern would not have been detected by an examination of main effects alone, illustrating the need to move toward more complicated interactive models in the study of psychological factors and weight.

TI  - Seasonal affective disorder: report from India (latitude 26 degrees 45'N).  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have established the entity of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and delineated the presence of atypical depressive features of carbohydrate craving, hyperphagia and hypersomnia. Most literature has emanated from research carried out in temperate climates, and only few reports are available from tropical countries, especially India. METHODS: Consecutive patients with recurrent mood disorder (who had at least 2 episodes of depression in the past) comprised the study sample. The diagnosis of mood disorder was made according to DSM-III-R criteria. The sample was divided into two groups - seasonal and non-seasonal according to the DSM-III-R criteria of seasonal pattern. The depressed patients were rated on SADD and HDRS, and manic patients on BRMRS. RESULTS: Eighteen of 93 patients fulfilled the criteria of seasonal pattern; 7 of these seasonal patients, and 25 of the non-seasonal patients were currently in depressive phase. Males dominated the sample in both the groups. The seasonal and non-seasonal groups as regards symptomatology, differed only on a few items - decreased libido on SADD, and suicidal ideation and helplessness on HDRS. Atypical vegetative features were not seen in any of the seasonal patients. CONCLUSIONS: SAD is seen at lower latitudes also, although atypical vegetative features are not a prominent part of the symptomatology. LIMITATIONS: The study sampled was obtained from a very select population, and thus does not indicate the prevalence of SAD in India. Secondly, the small sample size precludes any categorical comments of the symptomatology. Moreover, winter and summer depressives were considered as one group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Emphasising the presence of SAD in a tropical country where there is relatively less variation in daylight periods, this report forms a base for future studies. It also raises the question of the role of variations in daylight in the aetiology SAD.

TI  - [Depression in epileptic patients with and without history of suicidal attempts: preliminary report]  
AB  - Depression is a significant problem in epilepsy. Suicides occur in epileptic patients five times more often than in general population. Material included 34 epileptics with 76 suicidal attempts and 24 patients with no history of suicide. Psychical state was studied with Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In the group with suicidal attempts 65% of patients had depression (54.5% of them had major depression) and in group without suicide attempts depression was noted in 54% (23% with major depression). Patients with depression were divided into two groups: group I with suicidal attempts and group II without history of suicide. In group I more patients were alcohol abusers (50% vs 31%), more were treated because of epilepsy longer than 10 years (59% vs 46%) and more had tonic-clonic seizures (82% vs 46%). In group I, 54% of patients were on polytherapy (more than half of them with fenobarbital). In group II, 31% of epileptics were on polytherapy (no one with fenobarbital). Major depression was significantly more frequent in epileptics with suicidal attempts. The severity of depression may influence the risk of suicide. Major depression may be associated with late age of onset of epilepsy, longer treatment duration, tonic-clonic seizures, polytherapy (mainly with fenobarbital) and alcohol abuse.

TI  -  Rating depression severity in the elderly physically ill patient: reliability and factor structure of the Hamilton and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the appropriateness of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale in depressed elderly physically ill patients. DESIGN: Depression scale scores from depressed medical inpatients were assessed for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, and subjected to exploratory principal components factor analyses. SUBJECTS: 100 medical inpatients, aged 65 years and over (median age 80.5 years, range 66-99), 74 female, with Geriatric Mental State Schedule-AGECAT case level diagnoses of depression. MATERIALS: The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Coefficient alpha for the HDS was 0.46; for the MADRS 0.61. Successive deletion of HDS items to maximize alpha resulted in a six-item scale (alpha = 0.60); after deletion of five MADRS items, alpha was 0.77. Factor analysis of the HDS yielded a four-factor solution accounting for 57% of the variance, the majority due to anxiety and insomnia items; the MADRS yielded a two-factor solution explaining 60% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Coefficient alpha for both scales is well below the minimum necessary for the total score to be used to represent a single construct. The HDS appears to be an unreliable measure of depression severity in elderly people with physical illness, as the major variance in the scores is due to anxiety and insomnia. The MADRS performs better, and with modification may be an appropriate measurement of depression severity in this population.

TI  - [The pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal injury: an overview]  
AB  - Despite the enormous scientific efforts that have been made to clarify the pathophysiology of ischemic neuronal injury, the mechanism responsible for neuronal cell death after ischemia remains unclear. Neuronal injury can be roughly classified into three categories: acute ischemic injury, delayed neuronal death and neuronal injury in the penumbra. Flow disturbance known as the noreflow phenomenon and postischemic hypoperfusion is the first limiting factor for neuronal resuscitation after an ischemic insult. Extracorporeal circulation has been tried in an attempt to prevent this blood flow disturbance, but it has become apparent that this is no more effective than conventional resuscitation. Delayed neuronal death seems to be triggered by short exposure to ischemia. Although a molecular mechanism including "glutamate excitotoxicity" has been proposed to explain this phenomenon, the details are still uncertain. The interventional point underlying the protective effect of hypothermia against delayed neuronal death may be the key to understanding its pathophysiology. Neuronal death in the penumbra seems to show deterioration through a mechanism of repeated depolarization "spreading depression", although spreading depression itself has no harmful effect on neurons. The pathophysiological mechanism of spreading depression in combination with flow restriction and other relevant factors related to ischemia remains to be investigated.

TI  - Weight gain in depression remitted with antidepressants: pharmacological or recovery effect?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression remission is often associated with weight gain. It is not clear if weight gain is caused by a pharmacological effect of antidepressants, or if instead it is an effect of recovery from depression. The aim of this study was to try to clarify this point. METHODS: One hundred consecutive unipolar/bipolar remitted depressed private practice outpatients (DSM-IV diagnoses with structured interview) were interviewed with structured questions about weight changes occurring during depression and remission. Comparisons were made between remitted weight gainers and remitted nonweight gainers. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients showed weight gain when they remitted from depression, in comparison with their weight when they were depressed. No significant differences were found in age, gender, diagnoses, duration of remission, use of tricyclics, tricyclic-SSRI combination, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and mood stabilizers in remitted weight gainers versus nonweight gainers. SSRIs were significantly more used in remitted nonweight gainers. Significantly more weight loss and less weight gain when depressed were found in remitted weight gainers versus nonweight gainers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that weight gain in remitted depressed patients may not necessarily be a pharmacological effect of antidepressants, but may rather be an effect, at least in part, of recovery from depression.

TI  - Attributional style and depression in pregnant teenagers.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Study 1 evaluated whether pregnancy is a stressful life event for teenagers and is associated with depression for teenagers with a pessimistic attributional style but not for those with an optimistic attributional style. Study 2 replicated unexpected findings from study 1. Study 3 evaluated whether pregnant teenagers with a pessimistic attributional style will be more depressed after childbirth than optimistic pregnant teenagers. METHOD: In study 1, 122 pregnant and 96 nonpregnant teenagers completed questionnaires assessing depression and attributional style. In study 2, 43 pregnant teenagers and 49 nonpregnant teenagers completed the same questionnaires. In study 3, subjects from studies 1 and 2 were contacted by mail and asked to complete the same questionnaires; 63 (38%) did so. RESULTS: In studies 1 and 2, pregnant teenagers with a pessimistic attributional style were less depressed than those with an optimistic attributional style and the nonpregnant group. In study 3, pessimistic teenagers experienced a higher level of depression than nonpessimistic adolescents following childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy may serve to protect pessimistic teenagers from experiencing depression. The subsequent demands of motherhood may remove any protection from depression afforded by the pregnancy. The experience of depression being relieved by another pregnancy may be a previously unidentified risk factor for repeated pregnancies in teenagers.

TI  - An informant interview for the diagnosis of dementia and depression in older adults (IDD-GMS).  
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been no instrument developed for the differential diagnosis of psychiatric conditions using an informant. The present study describes the development and validation of an informant interview for the diagnosis of dementia and depression in older adults (IDD-GMS). The IDD-GMs, as its name indicates, is based upon the well-established Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS). METHOD: Thirty older adults with psychiatric illnesses were identified. An informant/career was interviewed using the IDD-GMS. Questions from the GMS were altered to reflect the informant nature of interview. Validity was compared to ICD-10 diagnoses. Interrater reliability was determined. RESULTS: Using a hierarchical diagnostic system, receiver operating characteristics demonstrated one optimal cutpoint for sensitivity, > 13 for dementia and > 16 for depression, and one for specificity, > 13 for dementia and > 10 for depression. CONCLUSION: The validity and reliability of the IDD-GMS falls within acceptable limits and indicates that the IDD-GMS can be used as a diagnostic instrument for dementia and depression. The IDD-GMS represents the first informant interview to achieve this.

TI  - Depressive symptoms of Alzheimer caregivers are mainly due to personal rather than patient factors [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictors of caregiver's depressive symptoms in a sample of community-dwelling Alzheimer's patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in an Alzheimer's unit specifically devoted to the care of demented patients in Brescia Province (Italy). One hundred and three dyads were consecutively recruited between July 1994 and July 1995. Caregivers were sons/daughters (65%) or husbands/wives; mean age was 54.6 +/- 13.2. Alzheimer's patients Mini Mental State Examination score was 11.3 +/- 8.3; patients were equally distributed among disease severity levels. The following variables have been collected: (a) background and context variables (caregiver's age, gender, marital status, education, relationship and cohabitation with the patient, employment status, satisfaction with household income);(b) caregiver's personal resources (health, social relationships and social interactions, formal supports use, assistance and vigilance); (d) primary stressors (patient's age and gender, cognitive status, functional status, frequency of behavioural disturbances). Caregiver's depressive symptoms represented the main outcome measure. RESULTS: Being husband or wife, low self-rated health and caregiving competence, high numbers of hours for assistance and patient's behavioural disturbances and younger age were associated caregiver's depressive symptoms. With multivariate analysis only relationship to the patient, caregiver's health and competence were independent predictors of caregiver's depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Factors related to the caregiver--relationship, health and competence--rather than to the patient constitute the main risk factors for caregiver's depressive symptomatology.

TI  - Interinformant reliability of family history information on psychiatric disorders in relatives.  
AB  - Knowledge on the reliability of family history information is essential for every family study. However, systematic analyses of interinformant reliability of family history information on individual relatives have not yet been published. Consequently, family history information on 1306 first-degree relatives and spouses of patients and of control subjects was collected from at least two other family members using questionnaires. Interinformant reliability was acceptable for dementia [Kappa = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.48-0.68], but less so for alcoholism (Kappa = 0.41, CI = 0.23-0.59), depression (Kappa = 0.26, CI = 0.14-0.38) and anxiety disorders (Kappa = 0.19, CI = 0.05-0.43). Demographic variables of subjects and informants and their familial relationship did not influence diagnostic agreement on the diagnosis of dementia. Diagnostic agreement on depression was significantly reduced when information from siblings of index subjects was compared with information from spouses of index subjects. The interinformant agreement for the diagnosis of depression was higher in younger than in older subjects (relative risk for disagreement 1.08/additional year, CI = 1.02-1.15). Siblings of index subjects seem to provide different, but not necessarily less relevant, family history information in comparison with other relatives. Researchers should be aware of the problem that depression in the elderly can be easily missed by family history. It seems more important for the diagnosis of depression than for a diagnosis of dementia to get information from multiple informants.

TI  - Comorbidity of mental and insomnia disorders in the general population.  
AB  - The co-occurrence of insomnia and mental disorders constitutes the most prevalent diagnosis pattern found in sleep disorder clinics. Yet, there remains a paucity of epidemiological information regarding comorbidity of mental disorders and sleep disorder symptomatology in the general population. The present study showed results based on a large representative French cohort (n = 5,622; 80.7% of the contacted stratified sample). A total of 997 (17.7%) individuals with insomnia complaints were identified and divided into six diagnostic categories: (1) Insomnia related to a Depressive Disorder; (2) Insomnia related to an Anxiety Disorder; (3) Depressive Disorder accompanied by insomnia symptomatology; (4) Anxiety Disorder accompanied by insomnia symptomatology; (5) Primary Insomnia; and (6) isolated insomnia symptomatology. Telephone interviews were conducted using the Sleep-Eval System. Subjects with insomnia related to a Mental Disorder have a longer history of insomnia complaints and are usually younger than those with Depressive or Anxiety Disorders accompanied by insomnia symptoms. Subjects with Insomnia related to a Depressive Disorder experienced more repercussions than any other group. A surprisingly high percentage of individuals with depressive symptomatology had sought independent medical treatment specifically for their sleep problems, which raises the unsettling possibility that many cases of depression go undetected by the general medical community. The distinct predictability of commonly undiagnosed depression leading to chronic depression speaks directly to the imperative that physicians receive additional training in this area of community mental health.

TI  - Illness behavior in the acute phase of motor disability in neurological disease and in conversion disorder: a comparative study.  
AB  - Sixty patients with a sudden onset of motor disability were assessed for illness behavior and depression. In 30 of the patients, etiology was attributed to a definite structural lesion. The remaining 30 patients were diagnosed as having conversion disorder. The Illness Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ) and the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale (HRDS) were used as instruments for assessment. The mean HRDS score was significantly higher in the conversion group, indicating a higher degree of affective disease in these patients. According to the results of the IBQ, the patients with conversion disorder showed a higher degree of irritability, disease conviction, and phobic preoccupation, and also, to a greater extent, rejected psychological explanations for their symptoms. Denial was high in both patient groups, coexisting with affective symptoms in the conversion patients but not in the neurological patients. Although valuable information could be extracted from the IBQ, it was not found to be a reliable instrument for distinguishing between psychogenic and organic causes of motor disability.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone in adults with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin systems in the pathogenesis of autism. Open-label reports suggest that the serotonin2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone may be safe and effective in reducing the interfering symptoms of patients with autism. METHODS: Thirty-one adults (age [mean+/-SD], 28.1+/-7.3 years) with autistic disorder (n=17) or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n=14) participated in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone. Patients treated with placebo subsequently received a 12-week open-label trial of risperidone. RESULTS: For persons completing the study, 8 (57%) of 14 patients treated with risperidone were categorized as responders (daily dose [mean+/-SD], 2.9+/-1.4 mg) compared with none of 16 in the placebo group (P<.002). Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive behavior (P<.001), aggression (P<.001), anxiety or nervousness (P<.02), depression (P<.03), irritability (P<.01), and the overall behavioral symptoms of autism (P<.02). Objective, measurable change in social behavior and language did not occur. Nine (60%) of 15 patients who received treatment with open-label risperidone following the double-blind placebo phase responded. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated, with no evidence of extrapyramidal effects, cardiac events, or seizures. CONCLUSION: Risperidone is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of symptoms of autism in adults.

TI  - Retrospective study on the impact of hepatitis C virus infection on kidney transplant patients over 20 years.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of chronic hepatitis is ascribable to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, whereas the clinical impact has not been understood in kidney transplant recipients. Our current study was carried out to assess the impact of HCV infection on kidney recipients over the long-term, and to investigate the effect and risk of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy for chronic active hepatitis C. METHODS: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (HCVAb) were examined prospectively and retrospectively in 280 patients, who underwent kidney transplants in the period from 1973 to 1996. The patient survival rate, the graft survival rate, the incidence of liver dysfunction and the cause of mortality among the HCV infected and noninfected groups were analyzed. IFN-alpha therapy was performed on 10 patients with chronic active hepatitis C. RESULTS: Prevalence of the hepatitis virus was quite high at 34.3% (96/280): the frequency of the HBsAg carrier was 3.2% (9/280), that of the HCVAb carrier was 28.6% (80/280) and that of the both carriers was 2.5% (7/280). The other 184 cases (65.7%) were negative for both HBsAg and HCVAb. Liver dysfunction developed at the significantly higher incidence of 55% in HCVAb carriers compared to the 9.2% of the noninfected group (P<0.01). HCVAb carriers had a poor survival rate in the second decade compared to the noninfected group: 83.7% vs. 88.91% for 10-year survival (P=0.44) and 63.9% vs. 87.9% for 20-year survival (P<0.05). The poor survival rate was a result of the mortality from liver disorder. Five patients died of such disease in the infected groups whereas no noninfected patient died in the same period (p<0.01). As the result of IFN-alpha therapy, biochemical activity normalized or improved in eight cases, whereas the HCV-RNA titer was reduced only in three patients. Only one patient maintained normal biochemical markers and undetectable levels of HCV-RNA for 2 years after treatment. The therapy was discontinued for five patients with the adverse effects of acute rejection, deterioration of diabetes, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: HCV infection has a significant impact on kidney transplant recipients over the long term and in particular affects them in the second decade. Our pilot study revealed only partial efficacy of IFN-alpha therapy for HCV-infected recipients, but with the high risk of acute rejection.

TI  - [The lipid peroxidation process in depression: the effect of trazodone]  
AB  - We investigated the lipid peroxidation in depression by determining the markers of this process: melondialdehide, total SH groups and catalase. We used blood samples from inpatients with specific psychiatric symptoms. The medication consist of hypnotic nitrazepam and antidepressant trazodone, using film-coated tablets trazolon, 50 mg once a day, three weeks. In the second part of our experiment, we studied the antioxidant properties of trazodone, using blood samples from healthy subjects. It remain to establish if the free radicals are responsible for the initiation of depression or not.
