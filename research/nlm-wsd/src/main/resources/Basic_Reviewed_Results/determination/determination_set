TI  - Respiratory patterns during sleep in Down's syndrome:importance of central apnoeas.  
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea episodes have been reported repeatedly in Down's syndrome (DS) patients as a consequence of the presence of predisposing malformations or intercurrent pathology of the upper airways. There are no data on respiratory patterns of uncomplicated Down's syndrome subjects. In order to evaluate the eventual effects of central nervous system (CNS) impairment on respiration in DS, we studied the respiratory patterns during sleep of a group of 10 DS subjects, aged 8.6-32.2 y, without relevant upper airway pathology. In order to control the possible effects of sleep structure and mental retardation on the results obtained, we compared the findings in DS with those obtained from a group formed by subjects affected by fragile X syndrome (six males and one female, aged 10.0-15.42 y) another genetically determined type of mental retardation. Sleep structure was similar in both groups; however, DS subjects showed significantly higher indices of central sleep apnoea and of oxygen desaturation than fragile X patients (P < 0.005). As far as DS individuals were considered, a significant preponderance of central, as opposed to obstructive, sleep apnoeas was found (89.4% vs. 9.4%, respectively; 1.2% were mixed) which showed a significant age-related increase. Central respiratory pauses were mostly preceded by sighs, which occurred more frequently during sleep stages 1 and REM, and were often organized in long sequences of periodic-like breathing. During REM sleep, they were less frequently preceded by sighs and by body movements than during NREM sleep. Obstructive sleep apnoeas occurred more often during REM sleep and were more rarely preceded by sighs or by body movements. Both central and obstructive apnoeas induced significant oxygen desaturation in 50-69.6%. Sleep structure was not significantly modified by apnoeas and oxygen desaturation. We hypothesize that the increase in central sleep apnoeas is related to a dysfunction of the central respiratory control at a brainstem level in DS.

TI  - Effect of elevated serum prolactin concentrations on the immunophenotype of human lymphocytes, mitogen-induced proliferation and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear cells.  
AB  - It has been suggested that the immune system is an important target tissue of prolactin (PRL). We therefore investigated several immune parameters in nine patients with chronically elevated serum prolactin concentrations. The immunophenotype of lymphocytes, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear cells were determined under high serum prolactin levels and 2 weeks after treatment with dopamine agonists. An increased CD4/CD8 ratio in the hyperprolactinaemic patients could be detected compared with healthy control subjects, which remained high after treatment and did not seem to correlate with serum prolactin concentrations. Peripheral blood B lymphocytes showed an increased expression of CD69 in the treated group but not in untreated patients compared with healthy control subjects. Interleukin 2 receptor, CD45RO, transferrin receptor or HLA-DR expression of CD4 or CD8 cells, as well as oxidative burst and phagocytic activity of granulocytes, were not affected in the patients with prolactinomas. Lymphocyte transformation response to phytohaemagglutinin in vitro was found not to be influenced by elevated prolactin levels except at the highest mitogen concentration tested. These data together with previous reports suggest that, although PRL is required for lymphocyte maturation to achieve normal immune function, elevated PRL levels do not lead to an 'overstimulation' of the immune system in men.

TI  - Evidence for association between the class I subset of the insulin gene minisatellite (IDDM2 locus) and IDDM in the Japanese population.  
AB  - Although the shortest (class I) minisatellite (i.e., variable number of tandem repeats [VNTR]) alleles in the 5' region of the insulin gene are positively associated with IDDM in Caucasians, the majority of Japanese are homozygous for class I alleles. Here, we determined the exact length, in number of repeat units (RUs), of class I alleles in Japanese subjects. The distribution of class I alleles in Japanese was trimodal, with peaks located at 32/33, 41, and 44 RUs. The shortest component (i.e., 1S [25-38 RUs]) alleles were significantly increased in the IDDM group compared with the control group (54 vs. 46%; P = 0.040). The 1S/1S genotype was significantly increased in the IDDM patients (34 vs. 20%; P = 0.005; relative risk 2.1). Furthermore, the transmission disequilibrium test of Japanese families with 1S/1M or 1S/1L heterozygous parents confirmed the association of 1S alleles; 17 alleles of 1S and 6 alleles of 1M (39-41 RUs) or 1L (42-44 RUs) were transmitted to affected offspring (P = 0.022). In addition, we found tight linkage of 1S with allele 9 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene microsatellite and allele (-) of the IGF-II gene Apa I polymorphism, but neither 9 nor (-) alleles were significantly associated with IDDM. The present study suggests that a class I subset may have a role in IDDM susceptibility in Japan. It was revealed that the difference between 1S alleles and 1M or 1L alleles is almost consistently characterized by a sequence variation generated by deletion of two copies of an ACAGGGGTCC CGGGG repeat element, implying that sequence variation of class I alleles may influence disease susceptibility.

TI  - Effect of fetal movement on the amniotic fluid index in diamniotic twin gestations.  
AB  - Fetal movement changes the size and location of amniotic fluid pockets during measurement of the amniotic fluid index. In singleton gestations, the effect of redistributing the fixed intrauterine fluid volume on the amniotic fluid index is clinically insignificant. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the index in twin pregnancies is unaffected by fetal movement. A single examiner prospectively determined the amniotic fluid index before and after three discrete episodes of movement by both fetuses of 82 diamniotic twin pregnancies referred for obstetric sonograms between 20 and 38 weeks' menstrual age. A reliable blinded examiner provided a second post-movement measurement as a control. Data were analyzed by the paired t-test. The mean change in the amniotic fluid index after fetal movement was 2.1 +/- 0.2 cm and 3.7 +/- 0.3 cm for post-movement determinations by the same and blinded examiners, respectively (p < .001). Interobserver variation was 3.5 cm. Intraobserver variation was 1.8 cm for the first examiner and 2.2 cm for the second examiner. Therefore, interobserver and intraobserver variation can account for the observed change in the amniotic fluid index following movement of both diamniotic twins.

TI  - Completion of the DNA sequence of mouse adenovirus type 1: sequence of E2B, L1, and L2 (18-51 map units).  
AB  - The DNA sequence of 9991 nt, corresponding to 18-51 map units of mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1), was determined, completing the sequence of the Larsen strain of MAV-1. The length of the complete MAV-1 genome is 30,946 nucleotides, consistent with previous experimental estimates. The 18-51 map unit region encodes early region 2B proteins necessary for adenoviral replication as well as late region L1 and L2 structural and packaging proteins. Sequence comparison in this region with human adenoviruses indicates broad similarities, including colinear preservation of all recognized open reading frames (ORFs), with highest amino acid identity occurring in the DNA polymerase and polypeptide III (penton base subunit) ORFs. Virus-associated (VA) RNA is not encoded in the region where VA RNAs are found in the human adenoviruses, between E2B and L1, nor is it encoded anywhere in the entire MAV-1 genome. The MAV-1 polypeptide III lacks the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif which is involved in an association with cell-surface integrins. Only one RGD sequence is found in an identified coding region in the entire MAV-1 genome. Similar to the porcine adenovirus, this RGD sequence is found in the C-terminus of the MAV-1 fiber protein.

The diazo-assay yielded values for total and unconjugated bilirubin which were considerably higher than those obtained by the HPLC-technique. This is probably due to unidentified diazo-positive compounds distinct from bilirubin. The direct-reacting fraction in the diazo-assay showed little or no agreement with the fraction of total ester conjugates determined by HPLC. Results indicate that the diagnostical value of bilirubin subfractioning by the diazo-method as a liver function test in cattle must be reconsidered.

TI  - Different racemization ratios in dentin from different locations within a tooth.  
AB  - It has been reported that the amount of D-aspartic acid in dentin is highly correlated with age. However, further studies are necessary to determine the details of this correlation. We quantitatively determined L- and D-aspartic acids in dentin, and from the data calculated the D/L ratio. We did not find any statistically significant difference in the D/L ratio between the same type of left and right teeth from the same jaw, and between the vestibular and lingual sides of the root dentin. However, the D/L ratio was significantly higher on the lingual side than on the labial side of the dentin. Although the D/L ratio in young subjects was comparatively high in the tooth crown and decreased toward the apex of the root, we did not always observe such a tendency in middle- to advanced-age individuals. These results indicate that the ratio of D/L aspartic acid in dentin varies between the lingual side and vestibular side of the crown dentin. Therefore, it appears that the racemization rate of aspartic acid is not uniform but differs with the region of the dentin, and may be affected by differences in factors such as temperature.

TI  - Hyperlipidemia is secondary to proteinuria and is completely normalized by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in hypertensive fawn-hooded rats.  
AB  - Two substrains of the fawn-hooded (FH) rat have been developed, one of which develops progressive hypertension and proteinuria, the FHH, and one which shows little increase in blood pressure and no renal damage, the FHL. Other hypertensive rodent models show primary metabolic disturbances before the development of renal damage, notably hypertriglyceridemia, which may also contribute to progression of renal disease. In this study we evaluated whether hyperlipidemia is a primary disturbance in FHH, or only occurs secondary to proteinuria. Lipid levels were determined before and after development of proteinuria, and compared to those found in age-matched FHL. We also determined whether reducing proteinuria with lisinopril would normalize lipid levels in aging FHH. At 4 weeks of age, proteinuria was very low (2-3 mg/day) in both FHH and FHL. While proteinuria increased steadily in aging FHH, reaching 350 +/- 62 mg/day at 40 weeks, much less increase was observed in FHL over the same period (32 +/- 5 mg/day at 40 weeks). Blood pressure was markedly higher in adult FHH than in FHL (158 +/- 2 vs. 129 +/- 2 mm Hg, p < 0.01). In 4-week-old FHL and FHH, plasma cholesterol levels were similar. Subsequently, cholesterol increased in FHH, reaching 3.4 +/- 0.9 mmol/l at 40 weeks, whereas cholesterol was barely affected by aging in FHL (2.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l at 40 weeks). At 4 weeks, triglyceride levels were lowest in FHH. Subsequently, triglycerides increased in FHH, reaching 3.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/l at 40 weeks, as compared to 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in FHL. Besides a transient increase in triglyerides in lisinopril-treated FHH at 11 weeks, increments in blood pressure, proteinuria, cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins A-I, B and E aging FHH were effectively prevented by lisinopril. These data strongly suggest that there is no primary difference in lipid metabolism between FHH and FHL and that changes in plasma lipids in FHH as compared to FHL are all secondary to proteinuria.

TI  -  [Tryptase determination in nasal washings in patients with allergic rhinitis]  
AB  - Triptase is an enzymatic protein found in the mastocytes. Although the biological role of this substance is not fully understood, significant amounts of it are found in the nasal secretions of allergic subject both when naturally exposed to the allergen and when subject to specific nasal provocation tests. The present study uses a radioimmunological method (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to assay the amount of triptase in two groups: one composed of 10 subjects suffering from allergic rhinitis and the other of 10 non allergic controls. All subjects were submitted to nasal wash with a saline solution prior to endonasal administration of an allergen extract (Poa Pratensis or Dermatophagoides Farinae). Fifteen minutes after nasal provocation the nose was once more washed out with a saline solution. All the wash liquids, both before and after stimulation, were assayed to determine the triptase content and the results for the two groups were compared. The results did not follow a normal distribution and were compared. The results did not follow a normal distribution and were processed with non parametric statistical methods. The allergic subjects showed base values, of 1.4 U/l (mean) while after allergic stimulation this jumped to 14.5 U/l (mean) (p < 0.005). On the other hand, the pre- and post-stimulation values were comparable for the non allergic group. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the basic pre-trial triptase levels in the allergic and non allergic subjects. The results indicate that assaying the triptase content in nasal wash liquid can provide a useful support in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.

AB  - A neuropeptide hormone isolated from corpora cardiaca of Melanoplus sanguinipes was purified by HPLC. The HPLC fractions were examined for adipokinetic activity with an in vivo bioassay. A single large UV absorbent peak was active in the mobilization of lipid while the other HPLC fractions showed no detectable activity. This large peak had a retention time and amino acid composition identical to synthetic Lom-AKH-I which was analyzed in a parallel manner. The primary sequence structure, pGlu-Leu-Asn-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Thr-NH2, was determined by automated gas-phase Edman degradation. The peptide was deblocked prior to sequencing using pyroglutamate aminopeptidase and the sequence was confirmed with mass spectrometry. The C-terminus of the peptide was determined to be blocked, as indicated by the lack of digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The knowledge of the primary sequence of Mes-AKH allows the use of a commercially available synthetic peptide and its antibodies for use in future research with Melanoplus sanguinipes.

TI  - The relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and body mass index.  
AB  - Obese patients have a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but a low response rate and high frequency of relapse after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UVPP). In this study we have determined the level of obstruction during sleep in 31 men with OSA, using a catheter with multiple micropressure transducers and a portable digital recorder. The proportion of apnoeic episodes with obstruction at lower levels correlated with increasing body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.05). Thus, with increasing obesity, there seems to be a shift to a lower level of obstruction. All patients with BMI > 30 and apnoea index (AI) > 5 had predominantly lower obstructions (P < 0.05). This may explain why many obese patients fail to respond, or have relapses after UVPP.

TI  - The ototoxicity of trichloroethylene: extrapolation and relevance of high-concentration, short-duration animal exposure data.  
AB  - Inhalation exposure to high concentrations of 1,1, 2-trichloroethylene (TCE) has been shown to damage hearing in the mid-frequency range in the rat. The present study directly evaluated the adequacy of high-concentration, short-term exposures to TCE for predicting the neurotoxicity produced by longer duration exposures. Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 10-12 per group) were exposed to TCE via inhalation (whole body) in 1-m3 stainless steel flow-through chambers for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week. The following exposures were used: 1 day (4000-8000 ppm), 1 week (1000-4000 ppm), 4 weeks (800-3200 ppm), and 13 weeks (800-3200 ppm). Air-only exposed animals served as controls. Auditory thresholds were determined for a 16-kHz tone 3-5 weeks after exposure using reflex modification audiometry. Results replicated previous findings of a hearing loss at 16 kHz for all exposure durations. The dB15 concentrations (concentration that increases thresholds by 15 dB) for 16-kHz thresholds were 6218, 2992, 2592, and 2160 ppm for the 1-day, 1-week, 4-week and 13-week exposures, respectively. These data demonstrate that the ototoxicity of TCE was less than that predicted by a strict concentration x time relationship. These data also demonstrate that simple models of extrapolation (i.e., C x t = k, Haber's Law) overestimate the potency of TCE when extrapolating from short-duration to longer-duration exposures. Furthermore, these data suggest that, relative to ambient or occupational exposures, the ototoxicity of TCE in the rat is a high-concentration effect.

TI  - Flow characteristics and required control algorithm of an implantable centrifugal left ventricular assist device.  
AB  - As the clinical application of LVADs has increased, attempts have been made to develop smaller, less expensive, more durable and efficient implantable devices using rotary blood pumps. Since chronic circulatory support with implantable continuous-flow LVADs will be established in the near future, we need to determine the flow characteristics through an implantable continuous-flow LVAD. This study describes the flow characteristics through an implantable centrifugal blood pump as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to obtain a simple non-invasive algorithm to control its assist flow rate adequately. A prototype of the completely seal-less and pivot bearing-supported centrifugal blood pump was implanted into two calves, bypassing from the left ventricle to the descending aorta. Device motor speed, voltage, current, flow rate, and aortic blood pressure were monitored continuously. The flow patterns revealed forward flow in ventricular systole and backward flow in diastole. As the pump speed increased, an end-diastolic notch became evident in the flow profile. Although the flow rate (Q [l/min]) and rotational speed (R [rpm]) had a linear correlation (Q = 0.0042R - 5.159; r = 0.96), this linearity was altered after the end-diastolic notch was evident. The end-diastolic notch is considered to be a sign of the sucking phenomenon of the centrifugal pump. Also, although the consumed current (I [A]) and flow rate had a linear correlation (I = 0.212Q + 0.29; r = 0.97), this linearity also changed after the end-diastolic notch was evident. Based upon the above findings, we propose a simple algorithm to maintain submaximal flow without inducing sucking. To maintain the submaximal flow rate without measuring flow rate, the sucking point is determined by monitoring consumed current according to gradual increases in voltage.

TI  - Measures of line jaggedness and their use in foods textural evaluation.  
AB  - The jaggedness of signatures, such as the force-displacement curves of brittle cereal-based foods, can be a manifestation of physical processes. Consequently, it should be regarded as an inherent property of the system rather than noise that should be discarded. Changes in the degree of jaggedness can provide useful information on the system's performance or on how it is affected by external conditions, such as exposure to moisture. Quantitative assessment of the degree of jaggedness can be done by methods that include statistical analysis, conversion of the record into a Fourier power spectrum, and determination of its apparent fractal dimension. Most can be performed with microcomputers and commercially available software. It is recommended that the jaggedness of any experimental curve or signature be determined by at least two methods or algorithms simultaneously for mutual verification. The magnitude of any single measure of jaggedness is determined by the signature's fluctuations amplitude and frequency. While the amplitude effect can be accounted for by normalization, the frequency cannot. Consequently, only curves having about the same number of points at the pertinent interval can be meaningfully compared. There is, however, a mathematical method, at this time still empirical, that allows meaningful comparison of the jaggedness of signatures obtained at different sampling rates. When several or numerous jagged signatures are recorded simultaneously, as in the case of brittle particulates compressed in bulk, the resulting combined signature is considerably smoothed. This is primarily the result of averaging caused by mutual cancellation of peaks in different directions and reducing the relative weight of any large peak. However, there are mathematical methods, some partly empirical, that enable restoration of the jaggedness of the original signatures.

TI  - Relative exercise intensity of long-distance marching (120 km in 4 days) in 153 subjects aged 69-87 years.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the relative exercise intensity (oxygen uptake during the march/maximal oxygen uptake, VO2march/VO2max) during a long-distance march in subjects or over 70 years of age. Secondly, the effect of hypertension, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases on the relative exercise intensity was evaluated. One hundred and fifty-three subjects, 97 men aged 76.7 (4.6) years and 56 women aged 72.8 (3.6) years who completed the 1993 Nijmegen day long-distance march (30 km x day(-1) on 4 consecutive days) participated in the study. Oxygen uptake (VO2) during walking at different velocities (v) was measured in a subgroup of nine men and nine women, selected randomly from the population under study. With these data, regression equations describing the relationship between VO2 and v were made. VO2march was estimated with the obtained regression equations from an average of the v(march) measured in all participants. VO2max was determined using incremental cycle ergometry in all subjects. VO2march was 13.7 (1.8) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) in men and 15.2 (1.3) ml x kg x min(-1) in women at a mean v of 5 km x h(-1) in both sexes. This corresponded to 52% of VO2max in men and 63% in women. In both sexes subjects with cardiovascular and/or pulmonary diseases walked at a slower v and thus lower VO2march compared to subjects without these diseases. Due to the lower VO2max in subjects with these diseases there was no difference in the relative exercise intensity between the groups. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that and not age on the prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and/or pulmonary that VO2max was the most important predictor of the variance in self-selected v(march). This study demonstrates that these active people aged over 70 years could maintain a high relative exercise intensity during endurance walking on 4 subsequent days. Furthermore, it shows that the relative exercise intensity of marching is within the range recommended for improving fitness and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Finally, these results demonstrate that VO2max has a more important influence on performance than does age or chronic diseases in active elderly people.

TI  - alpha 2-Macroglobulin synthesis by the human monocytic cell line THP-1 is differentiation state-dependent.  
AB  - Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is a broad spectrum proteinase inhibitor and cytokine carrier synthesized by a number of cell types including monocytes and macrophages. In this study, we report on the expression of alpha 2M by THP-1 cells. This monocytic cell line can be differentiated into a macrophage-like phenotype by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). alpha 2M was synthesized by THP-1 cells at a rate of 75 ng/10(6) cells/24 h, as determined by Western blot analysis. After treating the cells with 500 U/ml of IFN-gamma or with 100 ng/ml PMA, the synthesis rate increased to 219 ng/10(6) cells/24 h and to 179 ng/10(6) cells/24 h, respectively. The same agents also increased alpha 2M expression, as determined by Northern blot analysis. When the alpha 2M receptor antagonist, receptor associated protein (RAP), was included in the THP-1 medium, the amount of alpha 2M recovered in the conditioned medium increased. This result suggests that THP-1-secreted proteinases react with secreted alpha 2M and that the resulting complexes are catabolized by the alpha 2M receptor, which is also called low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). We conclude that alpha 2M synthesis by THP-1 cells depends on the state of cellular differentiation.

TI  - Defective thyrotropin receptor G-protein cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling mechanism in the FTC human follicular thyroid cancer cell line.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies report the effect of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) on FTC-133) and aggressively invasive (FTC-238) clones of a human follicular thyroid cancer cell line. Specifically, TSH induces fibronectin secretion by FTC-133, possibly as a result of increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), yet induces in vitro invasion through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. In normal thyrocytes, TSH activates cAMP through a stimulatory G-protein (Gs)-linked pathway. In the FTC model we studied the effect of TSH on adenylate cyclase activation. METHODS: TSH receptor (TSH-R) mRNA was studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Fibronectin transcription was analyzed by Northern blot and densitometry. cAMP levels were determined by an enzyme immunoassay. Gs alpha expression was determined by Western blot and a possible activating mutation at position 201 in Gs alpha sought by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of TSH-R mRNA in FTC-133 and FTC-238. TSH did not increase transcription of fibronectin mRNA. FTC-133 cells exhibited higher cAMP levels than did FTC-238 cells: 30.4 +/- 8.0 versus 13.0 +/- 3.5 femtomoles/10(4) cells (mean +/- SD; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). TSH did not raise cAMP levels in either clone. Gs alpha expression is equal in both cell lines and is not increased by TSH; sequencing showed no position 201 mutations in Gs alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Prototypical TSH-Gs-cAMP signal transduction is not functional in FTC-133 or FTC-238. Our findings implicate perturbation in TSH-R.

TI  - Pemphigus vulgaris in older adults.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) affects primarily middle-aged persons in North America. Conventional therapy suggests use of high doses of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. We have observed a group of older patients with PV and determined their clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical course. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with PV, in whom the onset of the disease was at age 65 or older, were observed and followed at the New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1985 and 1992. We determined sex and race distribution, disease severity, clinical presentation, autoantibody levels, treatment, response to treatment, and clinical course in these patients. RESULTS: Men and women were affected equally. All the patients were white, and 50% were Jewish. Extensive disease was observed in only 27.8%. The disease was localized in 44.4%; in eight patients (44.4%), the use of sublesional corticosteroid (SLS) injection alone produced satisfactory clinical response. In patients with severe disease, the maximum dose of 60 mg/day of prednisone was sufficient. Patients with moderate disease responded to 20 to 40 mg/day of prednisone. Immunosuppressive agents were used in only four patients. The patients were followed for 3 to 15 years (mean 5.2 years). None of them died of the disease or the complications of therapy. At the time we reported this experience, most of the patients were in clinical remission without any therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that prognosis for older patients with PV is favorable. In several older patients, PV was controlled by SLS or lower doses of systemic corticosteroids. Systemic agents should be used cautiously and judiciously, and supportive measures should be offered frequently and aggressively.

TI  - Conformational characterization of peptides rich in the cycloaliphatic C alpha,alpha-disubstituted glycine 1-aminocyclononane-1-carboxylic acid.  
AB  - A series of N- and C-protected, monodispersed homo-oligopeptides (to the pentamer level) from the cycloaliphatic C alpha,alpha-dialkylated glycine 1-aminocyclononane-1-carboxylic acid (Ac9c) and two Ala/Ac9c tripeptides have been synthesized by solution methods and fully characterized. The conformational preferences of all the model peptides were determined in deuterochloroform solution by FT-IR absorption and 1H-NMR. The molecular structures of the amino acid derivatives mCIAc-Ac9c-OH and Z-Ac9c-OtBu, the dipeptide pBrBz-(Ac9c)2-OtBu, the tetrapeptide Z-(Ac9c)4-OtBu, and the pentapeptide Z-(Ac9c)5-OtBu were determined in the crystal state by X-ray diffraction. Based on this information, the average geometry and the preferred conformation for the cyclononyl moiety of the Ac9c residue have been assessed. The backbone conformational data are strongly in favour of the conclusion that the Ac9c residue is a strong beta-turn and helix former. A comparison with the structural propensity of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, the prototype of C alpha,alpha-dialkylated glycines, and the other extensively investigated members of the family of 1-aminocycloalkane-1-carboxylic acids (Acnc, with n = 3-8) is made and the implications for the use of the Ac9c residue in conformationally constrained analogues of bioactive peptides are briefly examined.

TI  - Precore wild-type DNA and immune complexes persist in chronic hepatitis B after seroconversion: no association between genome conversion and seroconversion.  
AB  - Precore hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants may gradually prevail during or after seroconversion (SC) from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) to hepatitis B e antigen antibody (anti-HBe) status in many chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) patients. However, patients with CH-B still produce anti-HBe more than several years after SC, and the relationship between SC and genome conversion in the precore region has not been clarified. Therefore, in patients with CH-B who had a sustained loss of HBeAg and complete remission of hepatitis after SC, the precore region was sequenced in paired serum samples from 1 year before SC to 3 years after SC. Mutant precore defective HBV DNA was found in only 6 (19%) of 31 CH-B patients who had a complete remission of hepatitis after SC. Mixed-type HBV DNA (precore wild-type and mutant-type) was found in 4 (13%) patients. Wild-type HBV DNA was found in 21 (68%) CH-B patients after SC. Longer-term follow-up of 11 CH-B patients indicated that 3 of 11 patients experienced precore genome conversion 2 to 3 years after SC. E-plus DNA or e-minus DNA was semiquantitated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays before and after SC. E-plus DNA levels decreased from 10(5.56+/-1.58) to 10(2.45+/-1.61). Similarly, e-minus DNA levels declined from 10(4.25+/-1.56) to 10(1.86+/-1.37). By dot-blot assay, serum HBV DNA became negative soon after SC, as did serum HBeAg. In contrast, HBeAg-containing immune complexes were still detected after SC. Anti-HBe antibody was produced throughout SC and thereafter, as determined by a sensitive experimental assay. Therefore, we conclude that genome-conversion in the precore region is a separate event from HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion.

TI  - Determination of safe depth of pin penetration for repair of distal femoral physeal fractures in immature dogs: a comparison of normograde and retrograde pin placement.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the depth that implants may be safely placed into the distal femoral epiphysis (DFE) for the repair of distal femoral physeal fractures. STUDY DESIGN: The depth of the DFE was related to the radiographic thickness of the patella in this experimental study. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION: Twenty immature canine cadavers. METHODS: Patella thicknesses were measured from lateral radiographs. Actual DFE depths were determined for pins driven in normograde fashion and for pins driven retrograde from the central depression between the metaphyseal pegs and from the cranial pegs. The association of DFE depth and patella thickness was evaluated using linear regression analysis. Using 95% confidence intervals, rules for estimating the safe depth of implant placement into the DFE were determined. RESULTS: DFE depth had significant correlation with patella thickness for pins placed in retrograde fashion from the central depression between the metaphyseal pegs (r2 = .83) and from the cranial pegs (r2 = .82) and for pins placed in normograde fashion (r2 = .65). CONCLUSIONS: Based on 95% confidence intervals, pins placed in retrograde fashion from the central depression between the metaphyseal pegs may be safely driven into the DFE a distance equal to 140% of patella thickness. Pins placed from the cranial metaphyseal pegs may be driven to a depth equal to 80% of patella thickness, and pins placed in normograde fashion may be driven to a depth equal to 30% of patella thickness. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Measurement of patella thickness assists the surgeon in determining the approximate depth that pins may be driven into the DFE without penetrating the articular surface of the stifle joint.

TI  - [Rupture of the diaphragm caused by closed trauma. Case contributions and review of the literature]  
AB  - AIM: Retrospective evaluation of 19 diaphragmatic ruptures due to blunt trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected all patients with thoracic and/or abdominal blunt trauma who were admitted to the department of surgery (Clinica Chirurgica and Chirurgia generale C) from 1970 to 1995. We selected patients with ascertained diaphragmatic rupture. RESULTS: We considered 17 cases of TDR (15 males and 4 females). Mean age was 38 years (range 16-67). Radiologic findings were consistent with TDR in 10 cases out of 17 (58.8%). Right hemidiaphragm was injured in 6 cases (31.6%). 10 patients (52.6%) presented at operation with intrathoracic visceral herniation. 8 patients underwent laparotomy, 7 both laparotomy and thoracotomy, 4 thoracotomy alone. Perioperative mortality was 15.7% (3 patients). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features were complicated by a large number of associated lesions; radiologic diagnosis is comparatively easy if visceral herniation into the thorax is present, repeated radiologic examinations facilitate diagnosis. The surgical access is determined by concomitant associated injuries which may require urgent operation.

TI  - Cost analysis of the introduction of PBPC for autologous transplantation: effect of switching from bone marrow (BM) to peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).  
AB  - Increasingly, PBPC instead of BM are used for autologous transplantation. Limited data exist on the economic effects of this change. Using a resource-based utilization model we prospectively determined the costs of 48 autologous transplants (eight BM, 17 BM + PBPC, 23 PBPC), isolating the post-reinfusion period (day 0 to discharge) to better determine the effect of the rescue product. Length of stay post-reinfusion was significantly shorter in patients receiving PBPC (median 13 days) or BM + PBPC (median 14 days) vs BM alone (median 20 days) (P < 0.01). Accordingly, transplant admission costs were less in the PBPC groups (PBPC $22089, BM + PBPC $23179) vs the BM alone group ($32289) (P < 0.05). Rescue product acquisition costs were higher for PBPC (range $3439-$5157) vs BM ($2766) but these costs were offset by the more rapid recovery of patients receiving PBPC. Overall transplant costs depend on the conditioning regimen with a 10-fold cost variation among regimens. Modeled costs for autologus transplantation using various approaches to rescue product acquisition are given. The introduction of PBPC for autologus transplantation has resulted in cost savings at our institution. Although the acquisition costs of PBPC rescue product are greater than for BM, this incremental expense is more than offset by a less expensive post-reinfusion period.

TI  - Dynamic changes in spontaneous intracellular free calcium oscillations and their relationship to prolactin gene expression in single, primary mammotropes.  
AB  - Cytosolic calcium plays a critical role in the control of a number of genes, including that of the pituitary hormone PRL. Cells that secrete this hormone, termed mammotropes, display spontaneous oscillations of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) that are positively correlated to PRL release. However, the precise contribution of calcium signaling to the expression of any gene including PRL has remained obscure owing to the requirement for and lack of a strategy for monitoring both of these dynamic variables (gene expression and [Ca2+]i oscillations) in the same living cell. In the present study, we overcame this technical limitation by making real-time measurements of PRL gene expression in transfected, primary rat mammotropes previously subjected to [Ca2+]i determinations by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of fura-2. Our results showed that the majority of mammotropes (75%) exhibited distinct oscillatory behaviors that could be subgrouped on the basis of frequency/amplitude of [Ca2+]i changes, whereas the remainder (25%) were quiescent (nonoscillatory). Interestingly, most mammotropes displayed spontaneous transitions between oscillatory and quiescent states over the course of several hours. As a consequence of this oscillatory plasticity, there was not a positive correlation between [Ca2+]i dynamics and gene expression at any point in time, as would be predicted by studies with entire populations of cells. Instead, the relationship was distinctly inverse, suggesting that dynamic changes in PRL gene expression may be regulated by temporally dissociated transitions between quiescent and oscillatory states.

TI  - Structure of the Vdelta domain of a human gammadelta T-cell antigen receptor.  
AB  - Antigen recognition by T lymphocytes is mediated by cell-surface glycoproteins known as T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs). These are composed of alpha and beta, or gamma and delta, polypeptide chains with variable (V) and constant (C) regions. In contrast to alphabeta TCRs, which recognize antigen only as peptide fragments bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), gammadelta TCRs appear to recognize proteins directly, without antigen processing, and to recognize MHC molecules independently of the bound peptide. Moreover, small phosphate-containing non-peptide compounds have also been identified as ligands for certain gammadelta T cells. These studies indicate that antigen recognition by gammadelta TCRs may be fundamentally different from that by alphabeta TCRs. The three-dimensional structures of several alphabeta TCRs and TCR fragments, and their complexes with peptide-MHC or superantigens, have been determined. Here we report the crystal structure of the Vdelta domain of a human gammadelta TCR at 1.9 A resolution. A comparison with antibody and alphabeta TCR V domains reveals that the framework structure of Vdelta more closely resembles that of VH than of Valpha, Vbeta or VL (where H and L refer to heavy and light chains), whereas the relative positions and conformations of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) share features of both Valpha and VH. These results provide the first direct evidence that gammadelta TCRs are structurally distinct from alphabeta TCRs and, together with the observation that the CDR3 length distribution of TCR delta chains is similar to that of immunoglobulin heavy chains, are consistent with functional studies suggesting that recognition of certain antigens by gammadelta TCRs may resemble antigen recognition by antibodies.

TI  - Isolation, purification, and characterization of the major autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  
AB  - The major (26 kDa) autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. This purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. The pl of the 26-kDa autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. The autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. It was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria and the O-acetylated peptidoglycans from either Proteus mirabilis or Staphylococcus aureus. The N-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be His-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gly. The 26-kDa autolysin together with a 29-kDa autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.

TI  - IgE secretion is attenuated by an inhibitor of proteolytic processing of CD23 (Fc epsilonRII).  
AB  - CD23, the low-affinity IgE receptor, is up-regulated on interleukin (IL)-4-stimulated B cells and monocytes, with a concomitant increase in the release of soluble fragments of CD23 (sCD23) into the medium by proteolytic processing of the surface-bound intact CD23. The effect of inhibition of the processing of CD23 on IgE production in human and mouse cells and in a mouse model in vivo was evaluated. CD23 processing to sCD23 from RPMI 8866 (a human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line) cell membranes was inhibited by a broad-spectrum matrix-metalloprotease inhibitor, batimastat, with an IC50 of 0.15 microM. Batimastat also inhibited CD23 processing in whole RPMI 8866 cells as well as in IL-4-stimulated purified human monocytes with similar IC50. Batimastat inhibited IgE production from IL-4/anti-CD40-stimulated human tonsil B cells as well as mouse splenic B cells in a manner consistent with inhibition of CD23 processing. Release of soluble fragments of CD23 in the cell supernatants of tonsil B cells was inhibited over the concentration range of 1-10 microM batimastat and intact cell surface CD23 was increased on mouse splenic B cells in the presence of these concentrations of batimastat. IgE production of IL-4-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also blocked by 1-10 microM batimastat, again with comparable inhibition of sCD23 release over the same concentration range. Finally, in a mouse model of IgE production, batimastat inhibited IgE production in response to ovalbumin challenge as determined by serum IgE levels. Taken together, the data support a role of CD23 in IgE production and point to CD23 processing to sCD23 as a therapeutically relevant control point in the regulation of IgE synthesis.

AB  - The effect of formulation on oral bioavailability of the antiviral nucleotide analogue adefovir from the prodrug adefovir dipivoxil was examined in beagle dogs. A suspension formulation of adefovir dipivoxil granules was administered to five fasted male beagle dogs (250 mg prodrug per dog; 135.7 mg-equiv of adefovir per dog). Tablets prepared from the same granulation (batch B94) were administered at 2 x 125 mg prodrug per dog. In addition, the same tablets were administered to dogs in the fed state or following pentagastrin pretreatment. Two further tablet batches (H94 and D501) with slight formulation changes were also evaluated in pentagastrin pretreated dogs (n = 5). Concentrations of adefovir in plasma were determined by HPLC following fluorescence derivatization. Tablet dissolution was examined at pH 2.0. One batch of adefovir dipivoxil tablets showed a 5-fold slower dissolution rate in vitro (B94 = H94 >> D501). Adefovir dipivoxil was completely converted to adefovir following oral absorption in dogs. The oral bioavailability of adefovir from the suspension was 35.0 +/- 8.9%. The oral bioavailability of adefovir from the tablet formulation was 34.7 +/- 10.3%, 37.2 +/- 4.5%, and 44.9 +/- 5.9% in fasted dogs, fed dogs and fasted dogs pretreated with pentagastrin, respectively. All three tablet batches had equivalent bioavailability in dogs. Oral bioavailability of adefovir from the prodrug in dogs (35-46%) was unaffected by formulation, food, or the acidic pH of the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro dissolution of adefovir dipivoxil tablets did not correlate with oral bioavailability. Oral bioavailability of adefovir dipivoxil appears to be limited by low permeability and biological conversion of the prodrug to adefovir.

AB  - Within the pools of muH chain-producing precursor and mature B cells from normal and lambda5-defective mice, the frequency of cells in which both H chain alleles were productively VHDJH rearranged was determined. An equally high percentage (2%-4%) of cells carrying two productively VHDJH-rearranged H chain loci was found in precursor and mature B cell pools of both mouse strains. In all of these cells, one allele encodes a muH chain incapable of forming a surface-expressed pre-B cell receptor. Hence, allelic exclusion is maintained at the level of pre-B cell receptor expression. The surprising conservation of H chain allelic exclusion in lambda5-defective B cells suggests that an alternative form of pre-B cell receptor might function to ensure this allelic exclusion.

TI  - A model for the mechanism of human topoisomerase I. [see comments]  
AB  - The three-dimensional structure of a 70-kilodalton amino terminally truncated form of human topoisomerase I in complex with a 22-base pair duplex oligonucleotide, determined to a resolution of 2.8 angstroms, reveals all of the structural elements of the enzyme that contact DNA. The linker region that connects the central core of the enzyme to the carboxyl-terminal domain assumes a coiled-coil configuration and protrudes away from the remainder of the enzyme. The positively charged DNA-proximal surface of the linker makes only a few contacts with the DNA downstream of the cleavage site. In combination with the crystal structures of the reconstituted human topoisomerase I before and after DNA cleavage, this information suggests which amino acid residues are involved in catalyzing phosphodiester bond breakage and religation. The structures also lead to the proposal that the topoisomerization step occurs by a mechanism termed "controlled rotation."

Sensitivities of TH nPCR determined with a number of neuroblastoma cell lines and PBSCs correlated to cell line dependent basal TH gene expression levels and ranged from 1:10(4) to 1:10(6). The sensitivity obtained by immunocytochemistry was 1:10(5). We observed the highest PBSC contamination rate of 47% (18/38) among 38 PBSC specimens exclusively obtained from stage 4 neuroblastoma patients by using TH nPCR and GD2 immunocytochemistry in combination. Furthermore, a clinically applied purging method, CD34+ selection by immunoabsorption (CD34+ purity 42.4%), was used on 16 PBSCs. 10/16 (63%) preparations were contaminated prior to CD34+ selection and 56% (9/16) remained contaminated. A significant reduction of neuroblastoma cell contamination by CD34+ selection was not detectable, but the absolute amount of re-infused tumour cells was decreased due to 100-fold smaller cell counts of CD34+ selected grafts used for transplantation. 22 PBSC preparations were used for transplantation. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an event-free survival probability of 0.56 +/- 0.22 (n = 9) in the group with contaminated PBSCs versus 0.88 +/- 0.12 (n = 8) with no detectable neuroblastoma-cell contamination. Our data suggest that the combined use of TH nPCR and GD2 immunocytochemistry is optimal to detect contamination and monitor purging strategies.

TI  - A high-density rice genetic linkage map with 2275 markers using a single F2 population.  
AB  - A 2275-marker genetic map of rice (Oryza sativa L.) covering 1521.6 cM in the Kosambi function has been constructed using 186 F2 plants from a single cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare and the indica variety Kasalath. The map provides the most detailed and informative genetic map of any plant. Centromere locations on 12 linkage groups were determined by dosage analysis of secondary and telotrisomics using > 130 DNA markers located on respective chromosome arms. A limited influence on meiotic recombination inhibition by the centromere in the genetic map was discussed. The main sources of the markers in this map were expressed sequence tag (EST) clones from Nipponbare callus, root, and shoot libraries. We mapped 1455 loci using ESTs; 615 of these loci showed significant similarities to known genes, including single-copy genes, family genes, and isozyme genes. The high-resolution genetic map permitted us to characterize meiotic recombinations in the whole genome. Positive interference of meiotic recombination was detected both by the distribution of recombination number per each chromosome and by the distribution of double crossover interval lengths.

TI  - Increased cytokine production by gastric mucosa in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.  
AB  - To determine the mechanisms of gastric mucosal injury associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, we investigated the contents of cytokines and inflammatory cell infiltration in the gastric mucosa. Ninety-six patients with dyspepsia were studied (58 gastric ulcer, 38 nonulcer dyspepsia). Of the 96 patients, 63 were infected with H. pylori as determined by microscopic examination with HE staining, culture of H. pylori, or the rapid urease test. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from both the antrum and the body to examine interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha contents in the gastric mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inflammatory cell infiltration was assessed according to the Sydney system. IL-8 content was enhanced in both the antral and body mucosa of the H. pylori-positive patients compared with the H. pylori-negative patients. Furthermore, IL-8 content correlated well with the infiltration of both mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear cells. These results suggest that IL-8 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal injury associated with H. pylori infection.

TI  - Mechanism of gastric hyperemic response during acid secretion in rats: relation to nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and sensory neurons.  
AB  - The mechanism of gastric mucosal hyperemic response during pentagastrin-induced acid secretion was investigated in anesthetized rats in relation to prostaglandins (PGs), nitric oxide (NO), and sensory neurons. A rat stomach was mounted in an ex vivo chamber and perfused with saline or glycine (200 mM), and the mucosal blood flow (GMBF), determined by laser Doppler flowmetry, and acid secretion was measured simultaneously. Intravenous infusion with a submaximal dose of pentagastrin (60 micrograms/kg/h) caused a significant increase in GMBF as well as acid secretion. Such GMBF responses were totally attenuated when acid secretion was inhibited by omeprazole and cimetidine or when the luminal H+ was buffered by mucosal perfusion with glycine (200 mM). Tripelennamine, an H1 antagonist, did not have any affect on acid secretory and GMBF responses to pentagastrin. On the other hand, prior administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the NO synthase inhibitor, significantly mitigated the increase of GMBF induced by pentagastrin without any influence on acid secretion, and this effect was antagonized by simultaneous administration of L-arginine. The gastric hyperemic response to pentagastrin was also significantly mitigated by indomethacin or sensory deafferentation after capsaicin pretreatment, with no effect on acid secretion, and was totally inhibited by combined treatments with indomethacin plus L-NAME in addition to sensory deafferentation. Pentagastrin infusion for 8 h did not by itself cause macroscopic damage in the stomach, but additional treatments with L-NAME and indomethacin plus sensory deafferentation provoked severe lesions in the gastric mucosa. These results suggest that the gastric hyperemic response to pentagastrin (submaximal dose) is totally dependent on H+ and that this process is mediated by endogenous NO and PGs as well as by capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons and plays a pivotal role in maintaining mucosal integrity during acid secretion.

TI  - Surgery of spinal nerve sheath tumors with special reference to neurofibromatosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective study of 87 patients with spinal nerve sheath tumors to determine the overall clinical outcome and specific features in 20 patients affected with neurofibromatosis Types 1 and 2 (NF-1 and NF-2, respectively). METHODS: Case records, operation notes, outpatient files, and radiological examinations were analyzed for all patients treated between September 1977 and August 1994. Additional follow-up data were obtained using outpatient examinations, questionnaires, and telephone calls. RESULTS: During the study period, 128 spinal neuromas (i.e., schwannomas) and 6 neurofibromas in 87 patients were treated. Fifty-seven neuromas were associated with NF-2 in 17 patients and six neurofibromas with NF-1 in 3 patients. Patients with NF-2 and symptomatic neuromas presented with more severe neurological deficits compared to patients without NF-2. Eighty-six percent of the neuromas were removed completely. On average, most preoperative deficits or symptoms improved in patients without NF-2, whereas neurological symptoms remained unchanged in patients with NF-2. Multiple regression analysis revealed that partial removal, surgery of a recurrent tumor, NF-2, and old age predisposed for tumor recurrence. No increased risk of recurrence was observed for patients with NF-1. For patients without NF-2, we observed overall recurrence rates of 10.7% after 5 years and 28.2% after 10 and 15 years, respectively, as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. For NF-2, the recurrence rate at 5 years was 39.2%, and all tumors had recurred by 9 years. CONCLUSION: Spinal nerve sheath tumors carry an excellent prognosis in patients with NF-1 and in patients without neurofibromatosis. Symptomatic neuromas occurring in association with NF-2 present with more severe neurological deficits, demonstrate little postoperative improvement, and have a very high recurrence rate.

TI  - Elevated circulating calcitonin gene-related peptide in umbilical cord and infant blood associated with maternal and neonatal sepsis and shock.  
AB  - The role of the sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was studied in preterm and term neonates with sepsis and shock. CGRP levels in blood were measured by RIA. The identity of immunoreactive CGRP (irCGRP) in adult and infant human blood was confirmed by reverse phase-HPLC. CGRP levels were analyzed in a total of 189 samples (95 from cord blood and 94 from neonates). The gestational ages ranged from 24 to 43 wk, and the birth weights ranged from 520 to 4445 g. Cord samples were collected immediately after delivery and infant blood samples were collected within 12 h of birth. Samples were coded, and the data were assigned to groups after determination of CGRP levels. There was a weight- and gestation-dependent increase in irCGRP in the newborn population. The direct correlation of circulating CGRP with ascending birth weight and gestation may have significance in the development of the fetus. Infants with and without certain complications were grouped in 500-g intervals. CGRP levels in cord blood were significantly elevated when certain stressful situations existed in the mother. These included culture-positive chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, and severe preeclampsia. There was a similar elevation in CGRP in patient blood in infants with culture-positive sepsis and/or shock with blood pressure <2 SD from the mean for corresponding gestation. CGRP levels did not differ between male and female infants and did not appear to be influenced by type of delivery (vaginal versus cesarean section). There was no significant difference in CGRP level between cord and patient blood in preterm neonates, but at term gestation cord blood levels were slightly higher than those in the patient blood. These results suggest that inflammation and hemodynamic imbalance (e.g. shock) are associated with increased in CGRP levels in the circulation in neonates. Future studies will focus on the biologic effects of elevated CGRP during neonatal complications and will examine the utility of CGRP measurement for diagnosis and treatment of disease in preterm infants.

TI  - Comparison of standing sagittal spinal alignment in asymptomatic adolescents and adults.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective examination of the spine radiographs of 88 asymptomatic adolescents was performed to analyze the indices of regional and segmental sagittal spinal alignment in relation to the sagittal vertical axis as determined by the C7 plumb line. OBJECTIVES: To determine the sagittal spinal alignment in asymptomatic adolescents and to correlate the sagittal vertical axis with the overall sagittal spinal balance and other indices of sagittal spinal alignment. In addition, to compare these results with previously established data for asymptomatic adults. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies of sagittal spinal alignment have included subjects encompassing a wide range of ages. A previous study at the authors' institution established normative data for sagittal spinal alignment in asymptomatic adults. No previous study has reported on the correlation between the sagittal vertical axis and other measurements of sagittal spinal alignment in asymptomatic adolescents. METHODS: Measurements obtained from the standing lateral spine radiographs of 88 asymptomatic adolescents (age range, 10-18 years) were collected and analyzed using statistical methods. These data were compared with previously established data for asymptomatic adults. RESULTS: There was a striking similarity in regional thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis between adolescents and adults. Despite having similar regional and segmental sagittal alignments, adolescents had a significantly more negative sagittal vertical axis (mean, -5.6 cm) than adults (mean, -3.2 cm; P = 0.0001). Also, unlike that in adults, the sagittal vertical axis in adolescents was not significantly correlated with the distal segmental lumbar lordosis. The sagittal vertical axis in adolescents was significantly correlated with the level of thoracic kyphosis and the distances from the thoracic apex, lumbar apex, and T12 to the C7 plumb line. Sacral inclination, which is a determinant of hip extension and standing pelvic rotation, was correlated with the lumbar apex and the total and segmental lordosis, except at L5-S1. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic adolescents tend to stand in greater negative sagittal spinal balance than asymptomatic adults, despite similar regional and segmental alignments in the thoracic and lumbar spine. The role of hip extension, spinopelvic axis rotation, and other sagittal alignment parameters in determining the sagittal vertical axis in adolescents warrants further study.

TI  - The capsanthin-capsorubin synthase gene: a candidate gene for the y locus controlling the red fruit colour in pepper.  
AB  - The red colour of pepper fruits is determined by the y+ dominant allele and the yellow colour by the y recessive allele. The capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS) gene is activated specifically during the final stages of pepper fruit ripening. RFLP and specific-PCR polymorphisms derived from the CCS gene were analysed in a F2 progeny of a red by yellow-fruited cross. They cosegregated completely with fruit colour. Our results support the hypothesis that the yellow phenotype might result from a deletion of the CCS gene. These specific markers were integrated into the genetic map and will be useful for marker assisted plant breeding.

TI  - A nonsense mutation in the carboxyl-terminal domain of type X collagen causes haploinsufficiency in schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia.  
AB  - Type X collagen is a short-chain homotrimeric collagen expressed in the hypertrophic zone of calcifying cartilage. The clustering of mutations in the carboxyl-terminal NC1 domain in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) suggested a critical role for this type X collagen domain, but since no direct analysis of cartilage has been conducted in SMCD patients, the mechanisms of type X collagen dysfunction remain controversial. To resolve this problem, we obtained SMCD growth plate cartilage, determined the type X collagen mutation, and analyzed the expression of mutant and normal type X collagen mRNA and protein. The mutation was a single nucleotide substitution that changed the Tyr632 codon (TAC) to a stop codon (TAA). However, analysis of the expression of the normal and mutant allele transcripts in growth plate cartilage by reverse transcription PCR, restriction enzyme mapping, and a single nucleotide primer extension assay, demonstrated that only normal mRNA was present. The lack of mutant mRNA is most likely the result of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a common fate for transcripts carrying premature termination mutations. Furthermore, no mutant protein was detected by immunoblotting cartilage extracts. Our data indicates that a functionally null allele leading to type X collagen haploinsufficiency is the molecular basis of SMCD in this patient.

AB  - We investigated the utility of serum S100 determined by means of immunoradiometric assay in a cohort of 438 patients affected by cutaneous melanoma (126 untreated and 312 previously treated). Using 0.2 microg/l cut-off value, determined in 134 healthy blood donors, the sensitivity was 4.2% in stage I patients (4/94), 5.3% in stage II patients (1/19), and 38.5% in stage III patients (5/13). Even though the sensitivity increased progressively from stage I to stage II and III, these differences were not statistically significant. The prognostic significance of S100 evaluation at diagnosis was investigated in terms of survival but no statistical correlation between S100 basal levels and survival was found. In the 312 previously treated patients serum S100 levels were correlated to disease extent, high levels of the marker were observed in 42.8% (9/21) of patients with local recurrence, in 32% (16/50) of patients with lymph node and/or in-transit metastases, in 77.3% (17/22) of patients with distant metastases, and in patients with NED, the specificity of the marker was 96.8% (212/219). The difference between these groups were statistically significant. In conclusion, S100 protein was abnormally high in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Serial S100 measurements in a follow-up study are necessary to test the importance of the protein in the management of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

TI  - Ultrastructural changes and immunocytochemical localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 in guinea pig optic nerves after acute increase in intraocular pressure.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate ultrastructural changes and localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP 1) in optic nerves of guinea pigs in conditions of acute increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS: Intraocular pressure was increased acutely in 40 guinea pig eyes, and 40 eyes were examined in 20 normal control animals. Analytic methods included quick-freezing and deep-etching (QF-DE) and conventional fixation. Microtubule-associated protein 1 immunocytochemistry was performed. RESULTS: In conventional ultrathin sections, an alteration of the axoplasmic ultrastructure was seen only at the level of the lamina cribrosa sclerae. The number of microtubules was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that exhibited accumulations of membranous organelles. Cross-bridged filaments on microtubules were significantly reduced in number when determined by the QF-DE method. The immunostaining of tubulin or MAP 1 was less positive than in other samples with normal IOP, revealed by light microscopic immunocytochemistry. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that MAP 1 was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that showed accumulations of membranous organelles. CONCLUSIONS: The acute alteration of axoplasmic ultrastructures in some parts of the optic nerves at the level of the lamina cribrosa involves a decrease in the amount of MAP 1 and a decrease in the number of axonal cross-bridges on microtubules in a condition of acutely increased IOP, which could be related to microtubule instability and abnormal organelle transport in the axoplasm.

TI  - The potential of restricted access media columns as applied in coupled-column LC/LC-TSP/MS/MS for the high-speed determination of target compounds in serum. Application to the direct trace analysis of salbutamol and clenbuterol.  
AB  - This study investigated the potential of restricted access media (RAM) columns used as a first column in coupled-column LC hyphenated to thermospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-TSP/MS/MS) for the fast, selective, and sensitive determination of target drugs in serum samples. Because of their wide range in polarity, salbutamol and clenbuterol were chosen as model compounds and representatives of the class of beta 2-agonists. Three types of RAM columns were tested: (i) Pinkerton ISRP (internal surface reversed phase, 5 microns), (ii) SPS (semipermeable surface, 5 microns C18), and (iii) RP-18 ADS (alkyl-diol silica, 25 microns). A 3-micron C18 column (50 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) was chosen as the second column. Tandem mass spectrometric detection was carried out in the selected reaction monitoring (one parent-->one daughter) mode. With regard to retention and, moreover, the peak elution volume of the analytes, the ISRP material was found to perform best: a 50-mm x 4.6-mm i.d. ISRP column in combination with a 100% aqueous buffer (pH of 7.0 +/- 0.2) allowed the injection of large volumes (up to 200 microL) of sample without additional band broadening of the analytes and provided sufficient preseparation between analytes and large-molecule serum constituents. Under the selected conditions, both analytes could be determined in serum samples up to a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.5 ng/mL, with a sample throughput of 7 and 5 h-1 for salbutamol and clenbuterol, respectively. Method validation was carried out by analyzing, in the course of several days, calf and human serum samples spiked with the analytes. In the case of salbutamol, the overall recovery from serum samples spiked at levels between 0.5 and 50 ppb (n = 33) was 103.4%, with a repeatability of 12.7% and reproducibility of 14.3%. The overall recovery for clenbuterol was 99.6% (n = 15, spiked level 0.5-5 ppb), with a repeatability of 15.2% and reproducibility of 16.4%. The adopted LC/LC-TSP/MS/ MS analyzer appeared to be very robust under the selected conditions, and, after the period of analysis involving the processing of more than 100 mL of serum, neither loss of chromatographic performance nor pressure increase of columns or of the interface was observed.

TI  - Inhibition of calmodulin-activated smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase by calmodulin-binding peptides and fluorescent (phosphodiesterase-activating) calmodulin derivatives.  
AB  - Aspects of the biochemistry of calmodulin have been addressed that bear on its cell biological role as a mediator of Ca2+ regulation. Calmodulin-binding peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) were characterized as inhibitors of calmodulin activation of MLCK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the smooth-muscle regulatory light chain (MLC). MLCK activity was determined by measuring the rate of formation of one of the reaction products, ADP, in a coupled enzymatic assay by continuous fluorimetric monitoring of NADH removal in 100 microM CaCl2 at ionic strength 0.15 M, pH 7.0 and 21 degreesC. The Km value of calmodulin was 3.5 nM, a value 16-35-fold greater than the Kd value of calmodulin for MLCK [Torok, K., and Trentham D. R. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 12807-12820]. The different Km and Kd values are most likely associated with the rate-limiting step in MLC phosphorylation being associated with product release from MLCK. The values of the inhibition constants, Ki, were the following: Ac-R-R-K-W-Q-K-T-G-H-A-V-R-A-I-G-R-L-CONH2 (Trp peptide), 8.6 (+/-1. 4 sd) pM; Y4-analogue of Trp peptide (Tyr peptide), 7.3 (+/-0.1) nM; and A-R-R-K-W-Q-K-T-G-H-A-V-R-A-I-G-R-L-S-S (RS20-like peptide), 0. 11-0.39 nM. The Ki values were consistent with kinetically determined Kd values of the peptides to calmodulin.  Kinetic determination of Kd values required the use of a fluorescently labeled calmodulin, 2-chloro-(epsilon-amino-Lys75)-[6-(4-N, N-diethylamino-phenyl)-1,3,5-triazin-4-yl]-calmodulin (TA-calmodulin).1 Since, as here, Lys75 is a convenient labeling site on calmodulin for the introduction of fluorescent probes, the biological activity of the Lys-modified calmodulins was evaluated. TA-calmodulin and calmodulin selectively modified by 1-N, N-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (dansyl-C1) at Lys75 (dansyl-calmodulin) were characterized as activators of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) and inhibitors of MLCK. The Km value for dansyl-calmodulin was equal to that of calmodulin, and that of TA-calmodulin was 3.5-fold greater. TA-calmodulin and Lys75-labeled dansyl-calmodulin thus distinguish between PDE and MLCK being agonists to the former and antagonists to the latter.

TI  - Role of N-acetylglutamate turnover in urea synthesis by rats treated with the thyroid hormone.  
AB  - We determined whether the synthesis and degradation of N-acetylglutamate would regulate urea synthesis when the thyroid status was manipulated. Experiments were done on three groups of rats, each being given 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU, a thyroid inhibitor) without a triiodothyronine (T3) treatment, treated with PTU + T3, or receiving neither PTU nor T3 (control). The plasma concentration and urinary excretion of urea, the liver concentration of N-acetylglutamate, and the liver N-acetylglutamate synthesis in rats given PTU alone were each significantly higher than in the control rats. Compared with the control rats, the liver N-acetylglutamate degradation was significantly lower in those rats given PTU without the T3 treatment. Treatment of the PTU-treated rats with T3 reversed the effects of PTU to the values of the control rats. N-Acetylglutamate synthesis in the liver was closely correlated with the excretion of urea, and inverse correlation between the liver N-acetylglutamate degradation and urea excretion was found. These results suggest that the greater synthesis and lower degradation of N-acetylglutamate in the hypothyroid (PTU alone) rats would be likely to increase the hepatic concentration of this compound and stimulate urea synthesis.

TI  - In vivo studies on lysosubtilin. 2. Efficacy for treatment of post-partum endometritis in cows.  
AB  - Lysosubtilin is a broad-spectrum preparation of lytic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis designed for veterinary medicine. This study demonstrates its efficacy for the treatment of post-partum endometritis in cows. Prior to the determination of optimal therapeutic doses, samples taken from the uterus of sick animals were examined microbiologically. The examinations revealed a high incidence of polymicrobial infections (65.0%) caused by various mixtures of bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and fungi/yeasts.  Dose-determination studies involved 160 cows with clinical signs of post-partum endometritis. For treatment both aqueous and oil-based formulations were tested and the optimal dose was found to be 2 x 10(6) U lysosubtilin dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water. When administered intrauterinarily twice a week until recovery this dose resulted in a 100% clinical recovery rate (versus 90%) and a statistically significant decrease (73 +/- 5 d), when compared with cows treated with neofur (92 +/- 9 d, P < 0.05) in the calving-to-conception interval. These findings were confirmed by results of field trials performed in four Former Soviet Union republics (Byelarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia) on 932 cows. Increases in clinical recovery (93.7 versus 80.2%, P < 0.05) and conception rates (64.4 versus 45.8%, P < 0.01) were found to be statistically significant when compared with cows treated with neofur or uterosan. We therefore conclude that lytic enzyme preparations are prospective antimicrobial drugs and when used to combat animal diseases they may serve as a possible alternative to common antibiotics.

TI  - Monoclonal antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 protects skin flaps against ischemia-reperfusion injury: an experimental study in rats.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the blockage of polymorphonuclear neutrophil endothelial adhesion by using a monoclonal antibody to the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) ligand to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat skin flaps. A skin and subcutaneous tissue flap (3.0 cm x 4.5 cm) supplied by the superficial epigastric artery and vein including the femoral vessels was isolated unilaterally in 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats and clamped for 9 hours (groups II and III) or 12 hours (groups IV and V) of ischemia. Five animals in group I were sham-operated only with 5 minutes of ischemia. Animals in groups II (n = 10) and IV (n = 10) received 0.05 mg of monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 (0.20 mg/kg) in 0.5 ml of 0.9% normal saline intravenously 15 minutes before reperfusion; those in groups III (n = 10) and V (n = 10) received 0.5 ml of normal saline. The flaps were assessed histologically, by measuring viable and nonviable areas, and by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to determine the ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin. Flap measurements revealed that the average area of flap survival was 90.6 +/- 12.8 percent in group II and 18.3 +/- 19.6 percent in the control group (III) (p < 0.002). In the animals subjected to 12 hours of ischemia, those treated with monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 (group IV) were 57.1 +/- 23.1 percent viable, which was significantly greater than the control animals (group V), in which only 0.3 +/- 1.0 percent of the flap was viable. Analysis of the diffuse reflectance spectra showed a hyperemic response during the first 10 minutes after reperfusion in animals treated with monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1. In group III, however, the spectra demonstrated a decreased amount of oxyhemoglobin, indicating decreased reperfusion of the flap after ischemia when compared with group II. Histopathologically, few inflammatory changes could be observed in groups I, II, and the viable areas of group IV. Marked damage was observed in groups III and V. We concluded that treating ischemic skin flaps with monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 was effective for alleviating reperfusion injury after 9 or 12 hours of warm ischemia. The reactive hyperemic response determined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in groups II and IV correlated with areas of flap survival. Antibodies to particular adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, have potential clinical utility in that they could be administered, individually or together, to patients immediately before reestablishing perfusion after free-tissue transfer or replantation to block the adverse effects attributed to reperfusion injury.

TI  - Chromosomal aberrations induced by BK virus T antigen in human fibroblasts.  
AB  - Human fibroblasts, transfected with a recombinant DNA containing the neo gene and BK virus (BKV) early region, which expresses BPV large T antigen (TAg), show cytogenetic alterations characterized by dicentric chromosomes and other structural aberrations such as deletions, duplications, translocations, and ring chromosomes. Such alterations were absent or significantly less frequent in human fibroblasts transfected with a plasmid expressing only the neo gene. The chromosome damage in BKV-transfected cells was evident before the appearance of the morphologically transformed phenotype and therefore seems to be a primary effect of TAg expression in human cells. The specific pattern of chromosome aberrations suggests the prevalence of an indirect clastogenic effect, determined by the inhibition of p53 regulatory functions on genome stability by BKV TAg. Due to the widespread distribution of BKV in the human population and to the latent state of BKV DNA in many human organs, the clastogenic activity of BKV TAg may potentially participate in an oncogenic process involving BKV latently infected cells.

TI  - Conformational changes in yeast pyruvate kinase studied by 205Tl+ NMR.  
AB  - The interaction of the monovalent cation with yeast pyruvate kinase (yPK) has been investigated by 205Tl+ NMR. TlNO3 activates yPK to 80-90% activity compared to KCl with an apparent Ka of 1.00 +/- 0.03 mM in the presence of 4 mM Mn(NO3)2 as the activating divalent cation. At higher concentrations of Tl+, enzyme inhibition is observed with an apparent KI of 180 +/- 10 mM. The extent of inhibition is dependent on the nature and concentration of the divalent cation. The effect of Mn2+ on the 1/T1 and 1/T2 values of 205Tl+ in the presence of yPK was determined at 173.02 MHz (300 MHz, 1H) and 346.03 MHz (600 MHz, 1H). The temperature dependence of the relaxation rates indicates that fast exchange conditions prevail for 205Tl+ longitudinal relaxation rates. The correlation time, tauc, for the Mn2+-205Tl+ interaction was estimated by a frequency dependence of 1/T1m for several enzyme complexes, and an average value of tauc was determined to be 0.91 ns. The distance between Tl+ and Mn2+ at the active site of yPK was calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn2+ to the longitudinal (1/T1m) relaxation rates of Tl+ bound to yPK. For the apo yPK complex, the Tl+ to Mn2+ distance is 6.7 +/- 0.2 A. Upon addition of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form the yPK-Tl-Mn-PEP complex, the inter-cation distance decreases to 6.1 +/- 0.3 A. The addition of the allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to form the yPK-Tl+-Mn2+-PEP-FBP complex gives an intermetal distance of 6.2 +/- 0.2 A. In the yPK-Tl-Mn-FBP complex, a Tl+-Mn2+ distance of 6.0 +/- 0.1 A is observed, indicating that FBP causes a conformational change at the active site in the absence of PEP. Analogous 205Tl NMR experiments with competitive inhibitors of PEP (oxalate, BrPEP) indicate that these ligands do not induce the same conformational changes as do the physiological substrates and activators. Similar experiments with the nonallosteric rabbit muscle PK were also performed and analyzed.

TI  - pH titration of native and unfolded beta-trypsin: evaluation of the delta delta G0 titration and the carboxyl pK values.  
AB  - The stabilizing free energy of beta-trypsin was determined by hydrogen ion titration. In the pH range from 3.0 to 7.0, the change in free energy difference for the stabilization of the native protein relative to the unfolded one (delta delta G0 titration) was 9.51 +/- 0.06 kcal/mol. An isoelectric point of 10.0 was determined, allowing us to calculate the Tanford and Kirkwood electrostatic factor w. This factor presented a nonlinear behavior and indicated more than one type of titratable carboxyl groups in beta-trypsin. In fact, one class of carboxyl group with a pK = 3.91 +/- 0.01 and another one with a pK = 4.63 +/- 0.03 were also found by hydrogen ion titration of the protein in the folded state.

TI  - Three-dimensional structure of the Y1 receptor agonist [Leu31, Pro34]NPY as determined by NMR and molecular modeling.  
AB  - The solution structure of the Y1 receptor agonist, porcine [Leu31, Pro34]NPY, has been investigated by two-dimensional NMR and molecular modeling. A complete assignment of the NMR resonances was achieved and 201 inter-residue nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) connectivities could be identified, comprising several connectivities between the N- and C-terminal segments. A molecular model was calculated by distance geometry, simulated annealing and conjugate gradients energy minimization using the NOE constraints. The results indicate that, like NPY and other peptides of the family, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY adopts a folded hairpin structure with the terminal segments in close proximity. Analysis of the secondary chemical shifts for the CH(alpha)'s and of the temperature dependence of the NH chemical shifts combined with the NOE constraints indicates a tendency toward helix structure for the segment 18-30 and the presence of turn structure for the C-terminal segment (residues 31-36). Native NPY and [Leu31, Pro34]NPY have most of their structures in common but differ slightly in their C-terminal portion. Based on the structures of NPY and of its specific agonists, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY and NPY 13-36, conclusions can be drawn about the structural requirements for binding to the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes.

TI  - Sclerotherapy for malignant pleural effusions: a prospective randomized trial of bleomycin vs doxycycline with small-bore catheter drainage.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusions are a common problem for patients with metastatic disease. Most patients are treated with tube thoracostomy and sclerotherapy, although there remains no standard approach. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of bleomycin with doxycycline sclerotherapy for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions using small-bore catheters. METHODS: All patients with a symptomatic malignant pleural effusion referred for chest tube drainage and sclerotherapy over a 2-year period were considered eligible. Using image guidance, a 14F self-retaining catheter was inserted into the pleural space and connected to continuous wall suction. When drainage fell below 200 mL/d, patients were randomized to 60 U of bleomycin or 500 mg of doxycycline sclerotherapy. Response at 30 days was determined. RESULTS: One hundred six patients were enrolled in the study. Fifteen men (29%) and 37 women (71%) with a mean age of 57 years received bleomycin sclerotherapy. Twenty-one of the 29 patients (72%) alive and evaluable at 30 days had successful sclerotherapy. Twenty-three men (43%) and 31 women (57%) with a mean age of 61 years received doxycycline sclerotherapy. Twenty-three of the 29 patients (79%) alive and evaluable at 30 days had successful sclerotherapy. There was no significant difference in response rates between doxycycline and bleomycin (p=0.760). CONCLUSIONS: These data continue to support a role for small-bore chest drainage and sclerotherapy, although there was no significant difference in 30-day response rates between doxycycline and bleomycin.

TI  - Hepatitis G virus coinfection in chronic hepatitis B and C patients in Poland.  
AB  - This study evaluated the epidemiology and impact of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. Serum samples were obtained from 128 consecutive untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B (72 cases) or C (56 cases). The presence of HGV RNA was determined by PCR amplification of the 5'untranslated region; the sensitivity of the assays was ten template copy equivalents. The prevalence of HGV RNA in hepatitis B and C was found to be 25% and 34%, respectively. HGV-positive and HGV-negative patients did not differ with respect to risk factors for infection, age, sex, or alanine aminotransferase activity. Similarly, there was no difference in the severity of liver disease, as assessed with HAI score. In conclusion, we found a very high prevalence of HGV infection in chronic hepatitis B and C patients in Poland. Nevertheless, no evidence was found that HGV coinfection has any impact on the severity of the underlying disease.

TI  - Assessment of adenoidal obstruction in children: clinical signs versus roentgenographic findings.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As part of a comprehensive study of indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, we investigated the reliability of standardized clinical assessments and standardized roentgenographic assessments of adenoidal obstruction of the nasopharynx, and the degree of correlation between clinical assessments and roentgenographic assessments. METHODS: We rated the degree of patients' mouth breathing and patients' speech hyponasality on a 4-point scale (none = 1; mild = 2; moderate = 3; marked = 4), we averaged the ratings for each child to obtain a Nasal Obstruction Index, and we determined levels of interobserver agreement concerning the ratings. We classified lateral soft-tissue roentgenograms of the nasopharynx, based on assessments of adenoid size and of nasopharyngeal airway patency, as showing either no obstruction, borderline obstruction, or obstruction, and we determined levels of inter- and intraobserver agreement concerning the classifications. Finally, we determined correlations in individual patients between clinical ratings and roentgenographic ratings of nasal/nasopharyngeal obstruction, and calculated the predictive values of clinical ratings based on roentgenographic ratings as the gold standard. RESULTS: In sets of paired examinations, weighted kappa values for interobserver agreement concerning mouth breathing (total, 235 children) and speech hyponasality (total, 648 children) ranged from 0.84 to 0.91. The value for interobserver agreement concerning roentgenographic assessment of nasopharyngeal airway status (207 children) was 0.92, and for intraobserver agreement (191 children) 0.88. The Kendall's tau b value for concordance between Nasal Obstruction Index values and roentgenographic ratings (1033 children) was 0.51. Nasal Obstruction Index values at the lower and upper extremes--i.e., 1.0 and > or = 3.5, respectively--were highly predictive of concordant roentgenographic ratings. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that standardized clinical ratings of the degree of children's mouth breathing and speech hyponasality provide reliable and reasonably valid assessments of the presence and degree of adenoidal obstruction of the nasopharyngeal airway. These clinical assessments are particularly valid at the extremes of either marked obstruction or no obstruction. Clinical assessment alone may be insufficient to establish the presence of adenoidal obstruction, but clinical assessment alone when findings are unequivocally negative can suffice to rule out adenoidal obstruction with a high degree of confidence.

TI  - Identification of Tyrophagus putrescentiae allergens and evaluation of cross-reactivity with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.  
AB  - House dust mites are the most common cause of allergic sensitization in respiratory allergic patients in the world. Tyrophagus putrescentiae (TP), which was followed by Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP), has been reported as the third most common house mite in Korea. We previously reported that many respiratory allergic patients had become concomitantly sensitized to DP, DF and TP. The aims of this study were to identify the allergic components of TP and to evaluate the cross-reactivity between TP and DP. The allergenic components of TP and DP extracts were determined with SDS-PAGE and IgE immunoblotting analysis. The cross-reactivity as evaluated by ELISA inhibition and inhibitory immunoblotting experiments. According the SDS-PAGE, the protein components of the two extracts were somewhat different, although a few components displayed identical molecular weights. The 18 kD protein of TP was the most prevalent allergen in the sera of patients sensitized to TP and DP. Both of the maximum inhibition percentages of optic densities of TP-specific IgE in ELISA with TP and DP extract were 100%, respectively and the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) of TP extract and DP extract were 0.01 micrograms/ml and 0.02 micrograms/ml, respectively. Maximum inhibition of optic densities of DP-specific IgE in ELISA with TP and DP extracts were 29% and 100%, respectively and the ID50 of DP extract was 0.007 micrograms/ml. On inhibitory immunoblotting of DP specific IgE, 5 micrograms/ml of TP extract completely inhibited 16 kD without inhibiting the other allergic component. Whereas, on inhibitory immunoblotting of TP-specific IgE, 5 micrograms/ml of DP extract completely inhibited all the IgE binding components of TP. These results suggested that the major allergen of TP may be the 18 kD component and we also concluded that TP allergens have a strong cross-reactivity with DP extracts, but that DP allergens only have partial cross-reactivity with TP extracts.

TI  - Plastic film carbon electrodes: enzymatic modification for on-line, continuous, and simultaneous measurement of lactate and glucose using microdialysis sampling.  
AB  - Ring and split-disk plastic film carbon electrodes (PFCEs) were fabricated for use in thin-layer radial flow cells which were coupled to a microdialysis sampling system. PFCEs, were initially coated with osmium poly(vinylpyridine) redox polymer horseradish peroxidase (Os-gel-HRP). Then a second coat of oxidase enzyme was applied to produce enzyme bilayer (oxidase/Os-gel-HRP) PFCEs which were subsequently over-coated with cellulose acetate for use in the determination of glucose or lactate at 0 mV (vs Ag/AgCl). Split-disk electrode geometry enabled different oxidase enzymes to be immobilized on each half of a split-disk, Os-gel-HRP-coated, PFCE to facilitate the electrochemically independent yet continuous on-line determination of these two analytes from a single dialysate. In continuous-flow experiments, cellulose acetate overcoated oxidase/Os-gel-HRP cast-coated PFCEs were quick to stabilize background current and displayed linear and sensitive responses to substrates. The effect of ascorbic acid was minimal and cross talk between partner split-disk electrodes was demonstrated to be acceptable for in vivo applications. The utility of this analytical system is demonstrated by the quantitative on-line continuous assay of changes in dialysate striatal extracellular glucose and lactate from a conscious rat during (a) local stimulation of neurons by perfusion with the depolarizing agent, Veratridine, and (b) physical restraint.

TI  - Urinary excretion of purine derivatives as an index of microbial-nitrogen intake in growing rabbits.  
AB  - Three experiments were carried out to establish a response model between intake and urinary excretion of purine compounds. In Expt 1 the relationship between the intake of purine bases (PB) and the excretion of total purine derivatives (PD) was determined in seven growing rabbits with a mean initial live weight (LW) of 2.03 (SE 0.185) kg, aged 70 d, each fitted with a wooden neck collar to prevent caecotrophagy. They were fed on five experimental diets formulated with different levels of nucleic acids (0.00, 3.75, 7.50, 11.25, 15.00 g yeast-RNA/kg diet). The relationship between intake of purine (x, mumol/kg W0.75) and total urinary PD excretion (y, mumol/kg W0.75), y= 0.56 + 0.67x (r2 O.86; RSD 0.338), indicated that about 70% of duodenal PB were recovered as urinary PD and that the endogenous contribution was constant and independent of dietary PB supply. Endogenous excretion of PD (allantoin and uric acid) was measured in a second experiment using six rabbits fed on a purine-free diet and fitted with neck collars to avoid caecotrophagy. Basal daily urinary excretion values for allantoin and uric acid were 532 (SE 33.9) and 55 (SE 7.3) mumol/kg W0.75 respectively; xanthine and hypoxanthine were not found in urine samples and therefore the sum of allantoin and uric acid should comprise the total excretion of PD (588 (SE 40.1) mumol/kg W0.75). The xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2) activity in plasma, liver, duodenum, jejunum and kidney was measured in a third experiment. The activities of xanthine oxidase in duodenal and jejunal mucosa, liver and kidney were: 0.61 (SE 0.095), 0.37 (SE 0.045), 0.035 (SE 0.001) and 0 units/g fresh tissue respectively and in plasma 2.96 (SE 0.094) units/1. The results show that urinary excretion of PD may be a useful tool to estimate duodenal PB input and microbial protein intake once the relationship between PB and N has been established in caecal micro-organisms.

TI  - Photoactive yellow protein: a structural prototype for the three-dimensional fold of the PAS domain superfamily.  
AB  - PAS domains are found in diverse proteins throughout all three kingdoms of life, where they apparently function in sensing and signal transduction. Although a wealth of useful sequence and functional information has become recently available, these data have not been integrated into a three-dimensional (3D) framework. The very early evolutionary development and diverse functions of PAS domains have made sequence analysis and modeling of this protein superfamily challenging. Limited sequence similarities between the approximately 50-residue PAS repeats and one region of the bacterial blue-light photosensor photoactive yellow protein (PYP), for which ground-state and light-activated crystallographic structures have been determined to high resolution, originally were identified in sequence searches using consensus sequence probes from PAS-containing proteins. Here, we found that by changing a few residues particular to PYP function, the modified PYP sequence probe also could select PAS protein sequences. By mapping a typical approximately 150-residue PAS domain sequence onto the entire crystallographic structure of PYP, we show that the PAS sequence similarities and differences are consistent with a shared 3D fold (the PAS/PYP module) with obvious potential for a ligand-binding cavity. Thus, PYP appears to prototypically exhibit all the major structural and functional features characteristic of the PAS domain superfamily: the shared PAS/PYP modular domain fold of approximately 125-150 residues, a sensor function often linked to ligand or cofactor (chromophore) binding, and signal transduction capability governed by heterodimeric assembly (to the downstream partner of PYP). This 3D PAS/PYP module provides a structural model to guide experimental testing of hypotheses regarding ligand-binding, dimerization, and signal transduction.

TI  - The physiology and pharmacology of melatonin in humans.  
AB  - Melatonin (MLT) is a methoxyindole secreted principally by the pineal gland. It is synthesized at night under normal environmental conditions. The endogenous rhythm of secretion is generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei and entrained by the light/dark cycle. Light is able to both suppress or entrain MLT production on light schedule. The nyctohemeral rhythm of this hormone can be determined by repeated measurement of plasma or saliva MLT or urine sulfatoxy-MLT, the main hepatic metabolite. MLT can be considered as the output (the hand) of the endogenous clock. Since the regulating system follows a central and sympathetic nervous pathway, an abnormality at any level could unspecifically modify the MLT secretion, especially in patients with sympathalgia or dysautonomia. MLT plays the role of an endogenous zeitgeber on core temperature or sleep-wake cycle. Exogenous MLT is able to influence the endogenous secretion of the hormone according to a phase-response curve. There are practical implications for this property in situations when biological rhythms are disturbed (jet-lag syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, insomnia in blind people, shift-work, insomnia in elderly people). Improvement of pharmaceutical forms (controlled release preparations) or development of MLT analogs could lead to decisive progress.

TI  - The effect of noble metals on the mechanical properties of dispersed phase dental amalgam.  
AB  - The effects of noble metals added as part of a Ag-Cu dispersant on the compressive strength and creep of dental amalgams was determined. The Ag-Cu eutectic used in high copper dispersant alloy L(0), was altered by adding 15 per cent by weight (wt%) of noble metal in place of Ag. In L(1) the noble metal was Pd. In L(2), Au and Pd were combined in equal proportions. In L(3), the noble metal content was Pd and Pt in equal proportions. A low copper lathe-cut amalgam, Aristalloy was used as the matrix. Amalgams S(0) and S(1) had the same composition as L(0) and L(1) except that the the low copper alloy matrix was Spheralloy, a low copper spherical amalgam. The compressive strength and creep were measured according to American Dental Association specification No. 1 and the results analysed by ANOVA. The addition of noble metals to the dispersant significantly lowered the 1-h compressive strength of amalgams. Compared to the control amalgam L(0), the 24-h compressive strength was increased for L(1) and L(2) but lowered for L(3). The ADA creep values were significantly lowered by addition of all combinations of noble metals. Reported microstructural changes such as an increase in unreacted particles, and a slowed setting reaction may account for the findings.

TI  - Spontaneous mutation in lacI transgenic mice: a comparison of tissues.  
AB  - The nature of spontaneous mutations in the lacI transgene of Big Blue mice was determined in selected tissues. The mutant frequencies ranged from 2.5 x 10(-5) to 7.1 x 10(-5) for liver, spleen, bladder, stomach, kidney, bone marrow, lung and skin. We also determined the DNA sequence alterations in the mutants recovered from these tissues. In all tissues the predominant class of mutations was G:C-->A:T transitions, most of which occurred at 5'-CpG-3' dinucleotide sequences. Bladder, kidney and skin display the highest contribution of G:C-->A:T transitions. The second most common class of mutations was G:C-->T:A transversions. All other base substitution classes contributed < 10% each. Of the non-substitution events, the loss of a single base pair was the most frequently occurring event (< 10%). The similarity of mutational spectra (in terms of kinds of mutations detected by the lacI transgenic system) in all tissues examined supports the idea that similar mutational pathways function in these tissues in the absence of chemical or physical stimulus.

TI  - The development of passive health surveillance by a sentinel network of family practitioners in South Africa.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For the South African Sentinel Practitioner Research Network (SASPREN), a volunteer network of family practitioners in South Africa, to develop a health surveillance system through the surveillance of important health events. MOTIVATION: The incidence of important preventable diseases and the burden of disease are not reliably known in South Africa, both in the public and private sector. Incidence rates determined at primary care level could help with planning and delivery of appropriate health services and monitoring of the impact of intervention programmes. METHODS: Altogether 183 sentinel practitioners were recruited in nine provinces, from 2,478 doctors invited to participate. Of these 120 were active in reporting all their new cases of 13 selected health events to the study centre on mailed postcards. After data-capturing, incidence rates were calculated for defined periods. Feedback was given to the sentinels through a newsletter and personalised reports. RESULTS: A network of sentinel family practitioners has been established in South Africa, and can provide incidence rates for both diseases and interventions through a simple and cheap surveillance system. The calculated rates demonstrated periodic trends for certain events, as well as inter-provincial, -gender and -population group differences. CONCLUSIONS: As the validity of the dataset and its generalisation to the whole population is uncertain, its usefulness as point estimates of incidence rates is unknown. This information serves as an important pointer for further research. The trends of these rates may provide a valuable tool for monitoring the impact of public health policies.

TI  - Modification of cell cycle and viability of TLX5 lymphoma in vitro by sulfoxide-ruthenium compounds and cisplatin detected by flow cytometry.  
AB  - The effects of Na[trans-RuCl4(DMSO)Im] (NAMI), Na[trans-RuCl4(TMSO) Ind] (TIND) and Na[trans-RuCl4(TMSO)Iq] TEQU) were tested in vitro on TLX5 lymphoma cells in comparison to cisplatin by means of the sulforhodamine-B test SRB) for protein content determination, by acridine orange and propidium iodide staining and by means of the bromodeoxyuridine test, for cell cycle modifications. After 1 h drug exposure with metal-based drugs, TLX5 lymphoma cells require a further 72 h in vitro cultivation to show alteration of cell cycle. Ruthenium compounds show a different pattern of effects: TEQU causes the same dose-dependent cytotoxicity and DNA fragmentation shown by cisplatin, TIND reduces absorbance with the SRB test and slightly increases S and G2M populations with a time-dependent drug exposure of tumour cells, and NAMI is virtually devoid of any detectable effect. By in vivo bioassay of in vitro treated tumour cells, TIND and TEQU are effective independently of the time of drug exposure of tumour cells, this effect being confirmed by the same cell uptake of ruthenium after 1 or 4 h treatment, determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. These data stress the lack of the involvement of direct cytotoxic effects in the potent anti-metastatic action of NAMI.

TI  - Increased protein kinase C activity in myotrophin-induced myocyte growth.  
AB  - Myotrophin, a novel protein that has been shown to stimulate myocyte growth, has been isolated, purified, and sequenced from the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats and dilated cardiomyopathic human tissue. Recently, the cDNA clones encoding myotrophin have been isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant myotrophin was found to be as biologically and immunologically active as natural myotrophin. The mechanism by which myotrophin stimulates protein synthesis and initiates myocardial hypertrophy is not known. To evaluate the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in myotrophin-induced hypertrophy, PKC activity and its distribution in the subcellular fraction were determined in cultured neonatal and adult myocytes. PKC activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P into histone type III-S and PKCepsilon substrate peptide (epsilon(pep)) from [gamma-32P]ATP in neonatal myocytes. Myotrophin significantly stimulated PKC activity in neonatal myocytes and was associated with a significant increase in protein synthesis. The effect of myotrophin on the stimulation of PKC activity and [3H]leucine incorporation was abolished by pretreatment with either staurosporine or H-7, two selective, pharmacological PKC inhibitors. Pretreatment of myocytes with staurosporine also reduced the myotrophin-induced mRNA levels of c-fos and beta-myosin heavy chain. To evaluate the subcellular events whose occurrence was due to myotrophin and translocation of PKC, we studied the effect of genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on myotrophin-induced neonatal myocyte growth. Genistein attenuated the [3H]leucine incorporation induced by myotrophin. To define the specificity of the PKC isoform(s) involved in myotrophin-stimulated myocyte growth, both neonatal and adult myocytes were treated with myotrophin, and Western blot analyses were performed by using the antibodies of different PKC isoforms. Results showed that both PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms participated in the myotrophin-induced neonatal myocyte growth, whereas only the PKCepsilon isoform was involved in myotrophin-induced adult myocyte hypertrophy. PKCdelta and PKCzeta do not seem to participate in either neonatal or adult myocyte growth induced by myotrophin. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides specific for PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms further supported this result. PKCalpha is the major PKC isoform in neonatal myocytes and needs Ca2+ and phospholipids for its activation, and PKCepsilon (the Ca2+-independent PKC isoform) is present in both neonatal and adult myocytes; the 15-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of each were used for this study. Treatment of neonatal myocytes with the PKCalpha and PKCepsilon antisense oligodeoxynucleotides for 5 days significantly reduced Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PKC activity, respectively, as well as the [3H]leucine incorporation induced by myotrophin. Furthermore, myotrophin-induced PKC activity was primarily located in the particulate fraction and did not result in a concomitant decrease in the cytosolic fraction. Myotrophin does not change PKC isoform expression (both Ca2+ dependent and independent PKC isoforms used in this study) in rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. Our data suggest that myotrophin exerts its action on protein synthesis, possibly through a tyrosine kinase-coupled pathway and translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane.

TI  -  Spectrophotometric determination of moclobemide by charge-transfer complexation.  
AB  - A simple and sensitive spectrophotometric method is described for the assay for the moclobemide. The method is based on the molecular interaction between the drug and chloranilic acid, to form a charge-transfer complex in which the drug acts as n-donor and chloranilic acid as pi-acceptor. Chloranilic acid was found to form a charge-transfer complex in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a maximum absorption band at 526 nm. Conformity with Beer's law was evident over the concentration range 4-36 mg 100 ml-1. A complete, detailed investigation of the complex formed was made with respect to its composition, association constant, molar absorptivity and free energy change. The method has been applied successfully to the analysis of commercially available moclobemide tablets with good recovery and reproducibility.

TI  - Rose bengal dye concentration and volume delivered via dye-impregnated paper strips.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The technique of administration and the resulting volume and concentration of the dye delivered to the eye via dye-impregnated paper strips are not standardized or known. The purpose of this study was to use a standard technique for preparation of rose bengal dye from commercially available paper strips to determine the variability in concentration based upon soak time, and to determine the volume delivered by such a technique to a model eye. METHODS: Rose bengal filter paper strips were wetted for either 15, 30, or 45 s, and the resulting concentration of dye eluted was determined by spectrophotometry. With the same preparation technique and a 15-s soak time, the strip was applied to wetted filter paper, as a model for the moist surface of the eye. The volume of solution delivered was calculated by weight. RESULTS: Concentrations of rose bengal for the various soak times were: 15 s: 7.64 (+/- 1.11) by 10(-6) g/ml; 30 s: 9.70 (+/- 1.79) by 10(-6) g/ml; and 45 s: 10.27 (+/- 0.66) by 10(-6) g/ml. The volume delivered to the eye model with this technique was 17.43 microliters (+/- 3.09). CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of rose bengal dye delivered to the ocular surface by means of a wetted strip is relatively low and soak time/technique-dependent. This suggests a possibility that results in clinical studies with rose bengal strip application may be different than if controlled volume applications of commercially available 1% liquid rose bengal dye are used.

TI  - SSRIS versus tricyclic antidepressants in depressed inpatients: a meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability.  
AB  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) against nonselective and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (mainly tricyclic antidepressants, TCAs) in depressed inpatients was carried out. Twenty-five double-blind studies provided data on relative efficacy which was determined by a summary variance-weighted mean effect size calculated from the difference in the reduction in mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores for the two antidepressants in each study. Twenty-three studies provided data on dropouts and relative tolerability which was determined as the variance-weighted pooling of the relative risk (RR) of dropout for all reasons and for adverse effects from each study. TCAs were significantly more effective than SSRIs (effect size = -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.05, P = 0.011), although sensitivity analyses by analysing larger studies (> 100 patients) and those providing complete data reduced the advantage to TCAs to a trend (P < 0.10). When the TCAs were grouped into those with dual action on 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) and noradrenaline reuptake (clomipramine and amitriptyline) and those with predominantly noradrenaline reuptake (imipramine, desipramine and maprotiline), only the dual action TCAs had greater efficacy than SSRIs (effect size = -0.30, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05, P = 0.017). When TCAs were considered individually, only amitriptyline was significantly more effective than comparator SSRIs (effect size = -0.37, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.07, P = 0.015). More patients overall discontinued treatment on TCAs than on SSRIs (29.0% vs. 25.5%), although this did not reach statistical significance (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03, P = 0.121). However, significantly more patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects on TCAs compared to SSRIs (14.2% vs. 9.1%, RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.87, P = 0.003) with no difference in discontinuations due to treatment failure (10% vs. 11.6%, RR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.51, P = 0.42). This meta-analysis suggests that at least some TCAs may be more effective than SSRIs in depressed inpatients, with there being the strongest evidence for amitriptyline. A possible explanation is that this is related to a dual action in inhibiting both 5-HT and noradrenaline reuptake. In agreement with previous meta-analyses, TCAs appear less well tolerated than SSRIs, although the absolute risk difference for discontinuation due to adverse effects (4.9%, 95% CI -8.1 to -1.7%) is of uncertain clinical significance.

TI  - An auxiliary peptide required for the function of two activation domains in upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) transcription factor.  
AB  - Ubiquitous upstream stimulatory factors (USF1, USF2a and USF2b) are members of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper family of transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in the transcriptional response of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene to glucose. To understand the mechanisms of action of the USF2 isoforms, we initiated a series of co-transfection assays with deletion mutants and Ga14-USF2 fusions. The transactivating efficiency of the different native and mutant factors was determined at similar DNA binding activity. We found that: (i) exons 3- and 5-encoded regions are activation domains, (ii) a modulator domain encoded by exon 4 could be necessary to their additive action, (iii) a hexapeptide encoded by the first 5' codons of exon 6 is indispensable for transmitting activation due to both exon 3- and exon 5-encoded domains to the transcriptional machinery. Therefore, USF2 presents a modular structure and mediates transcriptional activation thanks to two non-autonomous activation domains dependent on an auxiliary peptide for expressing their activating potential.

TI  - CYFRA 21-1, a cytokeratin subunit 19 fragment, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with interstitial lung disease.  
AB  - 1. It has been suggested that CYFRA21-1, a cytokeratin subunit 19 fragment, is potentially useful for diagnosis and monitoring of lung carcinoma. However, serum levels of CYFRA21-1 are also increased in a high proportion of patients with interstitial lung disease. In this study we measured CYFRA21-1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 10 normal subjects, 18 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 14 patients with sarcoidosis, and determined whether any relationship exists between CYFRA21-1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and clinical parameters. 2. CYFRA21-1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis (mean value 8.3 ng/ml, P < 0.01) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (42.5 ng/ml, P < 0.005) than in normal controls (1.0 ng/ml). Moreover, higher CYFRA21-1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were found in sarcoidosis patients in radiological stage 2 or 3 than in those in stage 1. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, there was a significant correlation between CYFRA21-1 levels, and percentage of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (r = 0.56, P < 0.05) and the magnitude of the alveolar--arterial oxygen pressure difference [P(A-a)O2] gradient (r = 0.66, P < 0.01). 3. Serial bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained from six patients with clinically active pneumonitis after they had undergone systemic corticosteroid therapy. CYFRA21-1 levels were significantly lower after these patients exhibited clinical improvement (P < 0.05). 4. These findings suggest that the level of CYFRA21-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is a useful marker for the clinical diagnosis of pneumonitis, and is also adequate for the evaluation of disease activity, especially over the course of treatment.

TI  - One-step affinity purification protocol for human telomerase.  
AB  - Human telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzyme, comprising protein components and an RNA template that catalyses telomere elongation through the addition of TTAGGG repeats. Telomerase function has been implicated in aging and cancer cell immortalization. We report a rapid and efficient one-step purification protocol to obtain highly active telomerase from human cells. The purification is based on affinity chromatography of nuclear extracts with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the template region of the human telomerase RNA component. Bound telomerase is eluted with a displacement oligonucleotide under mild conditions. The resulting affinity-purified telomerase is active in PCR-amplified telomerase assays. The purified telomerase complex has a molecular mass of approximately 550 kDa compared to the approximately 1000 kDa determined for the telomerase RNP in unfractionated nuclear extracts. The purification protocol provides a rapid and efficient tool for functional and structural studies of human telomerase.

TI  - In vivo efficacies of amoxicillin and cefuroxime against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in a gerbil model of acute otitis media.  
AB  - The comparative efficacies of amoxicillin and cefuroxime against acute otitis media caused by a penicillin-resistant (MIC, 2 micrograms/ml) Streptococcus pneumoniae strain were assessed in a gerbil model by challenging each ear with 10(7) bacteria through transbullar instillation. Each antibiotic was tested at two doses (5 and 20 mg/kg of body weight) administered at 2, 10, and 18 h postinoculation. Samples were obtained from the middle ear (ME) on days 3 and 7 postinoculation for determination of bacterial counts. Only amoxicillin, at both doses, was able to significantly halt the weight loss in animals, reducing both the number of culture-positive animals and the bacterial concentration in ME samples versus the values for untreated animals. Comparison of the efficacies between the antibiotics, determined by their ability to achieve culture-negative ME specimens, showed that amoxicillin at 5 mg/kg was significantly more active than cefuroxime at the same dose. The use of higher doses of either amoxicillin or cefuroxime did not produce significantly better results than those obtained with the lower dose but caused a greater inflammatory response. The more favorable results obtained with amoxicillin compared with those obtained with cefuroxime could be related to the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pneumococcal strain (MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations of 1 and 1 microgram/ml and 4 and 4 micrograms/ml for amoxicillin and cefuroxime, respectively) as well as to the better pharmacokinetic parameters obtained with amoxicillin.

AB  - We describe a new HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of lactulose and mannitol in urine, in which cation-exchange chromatography and evaporative light-scattering detection are used. The two sugars are orally administered for the estimation of intestinal permeability in children. Samples were purified by solid phase extraction on a C18 cartridge and subsequent addition of anion-exchange resin. Cellobiose may be used as an internal standard. The chromatographic separation was carried out in 16 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, using deionized water as the mobile phase. Within-run precision (CV) measured at three concentrations was 1.6-2.3% for lactulose and 1.0-1.9% for mannitol. Between-run CVs were 2.1-4.1% and 1.3-2.7% for lactulose and mannitol, respectively. Analytical recovery of both sugar probes was 97-101%. The detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) were 0.82 mg/L for lactulose and 0.65 mg/L for mannitol. The lactulose/ mannitol ratio in control subjects was 0.024 +/- 0.006; in patients with Crohn's and coeliac diseases in active phase, the ratios were 0.200 +/- 0.082 and 0.072 +/- 0.025, respectively. The method is rapid, simple, and sensitive, and suitable for determination of intestinal permeability in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish whether the relationship between cavernosal pressures and gravitational pressures of infused liquid during gravity cavernosometry is linear when complete smooth muscle relaxation is achieved and whether the determination of this relationship could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between organic and functional cavernous leakage. METHODS: Gravity cavernosometry was performed in 50 impotent patients. The cavernosal pressure was measured at at least four different gravitational pressures of the infused liquid. RESULTS: A linear relationship was obtained in all patients with normal maximal cavernosal pressure at gravity cavernosometry. A flat or nonlinear relationship was found in those with abnormal maximal pressure, whatever the cause of cavernous leakage. CONCLUSIONS: A linear relationship between cavernosal and gravitational pressures characterizes complete smooth muscle relaxation during gravity cavernosometry. However, the usefulness of the determination of this relationship is not yet established.

TI  - A general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability of a protein: stability and structure of a series of hydrophobic mutants of human lysozyme.  
AB  - To get a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability, five Ile to Val and nine Val to Ala mutants (3SS mutants) from 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme were constructed. As known from previous studies, the 3SS protein lacking a disulfide bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic factors, as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kJ/mol in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaG) value, as compared to the wild-type protein, which has four disulfide bonds. In this study, the stabilities and structures of the 3SS mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis, respectively, and compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the wild-type (4SS) protein published previously.The stabilities of all the 3SS mutants, except for V110A-3SS were decreased as compared with that of the 3SS protein, coinciding with the results for the 4SS mutants. The change in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaDeltaG) values of the 3SS mutants relative to the 3SS protein at the denaturation temperature (49.2 degreesC) of the 3SS protein at pH 2.7 were similar to those of the equivalent 4SS mutants relative to the wild-type at 64.9 degreesC.The Delta DeltaG values of the 3SS mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (Delta DeltaASAHP) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were considered. This correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4SS mutants. The linear relation between Delta DeltaG and Delta DeltaASAHP for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of T4 lysozyme already reported, indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations.

TI  - Nine-year follow-up study of heart rate variability in patients with Duchenne-type progressive muscular dystrophy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the progression of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Duchenne-type progressive muscular dystrophy (DMD) over time by using heart rate variability. BACKGROUND: Although previous studies suggest the presence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with DMD, the precise cause is not known. On the other hand, it is well known that analysis of heart rate variability provides a useful, noninvasive means of quantifying autonomic activity. High frequency power is determined predominantly by the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas low frequency power is determined by both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Frequency and time domain analyses of heart rate variability during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were performed in 17 patients with DMD over a 9-year period. At the time of entry, the mean patient age was 11 years and the mean Swinyard-Deaver stage was 4. In the first year, high frequency power was significantly lower and the ratio of low frequency to high frequency was significantly higher in patients with DMD than in the normal control subjects. These differences become significantly greater as the disease progressed. At the time of entry, low and high frequency powers increased at night in both groups. However, over time, high and low frequency powers at night tended to decrease. All of the time domain parameters were significantly lower in the patients with DMD at all time points compared with the normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that DMD patients have either a decrease in parasympathetic activity, an increase in sympathetic activity, or both as their disease progresses.

TI  - Evaluation of mechanical properties of dental ceramic core materials in combination with porcelains.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This paper describes the mechanical testing of dental ceramic core materials in combination with porcelains to simulate the real service conditions for dental applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included Procera AllCeram (densely sintered high-purity alumina); Vita In-Ceram (glass-infiltrated presintered alumina); three dental porcelains (Procera Porcelain AllCeram, Vitadur-N, and Vitadur Alpha); and densely sintered alumina-Procera Porcelain AllCeram two-layer composites, densely sintered alumina-Vitadur-N two-layer composites, and glass-infiltrated presintered alumina-Vitadur Alpha two-layer composites, with different thicknesses of densely sintered alumina or glass-infiltrated presintered alumina, respectively. The flexural tests were performed in ring-on-ring biaxial bending. The flexural failure stresses were determined using both Timoshenko's biaxial loading equation and Shetty's ring-on-ring stress equation. The bending theory of bilayer plates was used to evaluate the failure stresses in the two-layer composites. Weibull statistics were applied to all stress data, and the information was used to estimate the failure probability at selected applied stresses for a comparison of different two-layer densely sintered alumina-porcelain composites. RESULTS: The failure stress of densely sintered alumina is significantly higher than that of glass-infiltrated presintered alumina as a core dental material under the same testing conditions. The failure stresses of the three commercial dental porcelains are statistically the same. CONCLUSION: The results show that the densely sintered alumina-Procera Porcelain AllCeram two-layer composite has interesting dental applications.

TI  - Crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of alpha 2-macroglobulin.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The large plasma proteinase inhibitors of the alpha 2-macroglobulin superfamily inhibit proteinases by capturing them within a central cavity of the inhibitor molecule. After reaction with the proteinase, the alpha-macroglobulin-proteinase complex binds to the alpha-macroglobulin receptor, present in the liver and other tissues, and becomes endocytosed and rapidly removed from the circulation. The complex binds to the receptor via recognition sites located on a separate domain of approximately 138 residues positioned at the C terminus of the alpha-macroglobulin subunit. RESULTS: The crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of bovine alpha 2-macroglobulin (bRBD) has been determined at a resolution of 1.9 A. The domain primarily comprises a nine-strand beta structure with a jelly-roll topology, but also contains two small alpha helices. CONCLUSIONS: The surface patch responsible for receptor recognition is thought to involve residues located on one of the two alpha helices of the bRBD as well as residues in two of the beta strands. Located on this alpha helix are two lysine residues that are important for receptor binding. The structure of bRBD is very similar to the approximately 100-residue C-terminal domain of factor XIII, a transglutaminase from the blood coagulation system.

TI  - Comparison of biopsy and serological methods of diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and the potential role of antibiotics [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic biopsy and serological methods were compared for their ability to detect Helicobacter pylori infection in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at a state university hospital. METHODS: Subjects were characterized on the basis of gastrointestinal symptoms, endoscopic findings, socioeconomic and demographic features, and the use of certain medications, tobacco, and alcohol. Current infection was detected in gastric antral specimens by rapid urease testing, histopathology, and bacterial culture. Serum levels of IgG to H. pylori were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Of 240 subjects, 115 (47.9%) were currently infected as determined by rapid urease testing, histopathology, and/or culture results, whereas 63.3% had elevated anti-H. pylori IgG levels (p < 0.001). This difference in the prevalence of current infection and seropositivity was preserved when the study population was analyzed according to age, race, gender, and other characteristics. Prior use of antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the frequency of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: Serological evidence of H. pylori infection was consistently greater than the prevalence of infection documented by biopsy methods in this study, suggesting suppression or recent clearance of infection. Further studies are needed to examine the factors that may affect the detection of H. pylori infection.

TI  - Indoor exposure to 222Rn: a public health perspective.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the lung cancer risk resulting from indoor radon exposure in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce this exposure. Concentrations of radon were determined in a representative sample of houses, and the corresponding lung cancer risk estimates were generated using the BEIR IV model, taking into account smoking, residential mobility, and regional variations in radon concentrations. Mean (geometric) radon concentrations in basements (n = 418) and on first floors (n = 319) were, respectively, 34.4 (95% CI-30.6 to 38.8) and 16.5 Bq m(-3) (14.2 to 19.3). A total of 109 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur as a result of this exposure in a cohort of 60,000 people. Detecting all residences with high radon concentrations (equal to or above 200 Bq m(-3)) and implementing mitigation measures in each of them would reduce by 4 the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure. A reduction of 0.05% in the prevalence of smoking would prevent as many deaths from lung cancer as would radon mitigation. From a public health perspective, in order to reduce mortality from lung cancer, most efforts should be focused on smoking, not on the relatively minor and hardly preventable population risk arising from household radon exposure.

TI  - Dynamic determination of human glioma invasion in vitro.  
AB  - OBJECT: The goal of this study was to evaluate whether there is any relationship between survival of patients with brain tumor and tumor proliferation or tumor invasion in vitro. METHODS: Samples of freshly resected brain tumors from 14 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were directly grown as three-dimensional multicellular spheroids. The tumor spheroids were cocultured with fetal rat brain cell aggregates (BCAs), used to represent an organotypical normal brain tissue model. Before the coculture, the tumor spheroids and the BCAs were stained with two different carbocyanine dyes, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and 3,3'-dioctadecycloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO), respectively. During the coculture, confocal laser scanning microscopy allowed a sequential analysis of tumor cell invasion by visualizing dynamic aspects of the invasive process. Single cocultures were examined at three different time points (24, 48, and 96 hours). During the observation period there was a change in the structural morphology of the cocultures, with a progressive decrease in BCA volume. Furthermore, the scanning confocal micrographs revealed a bidirectional movement of tumor cells and normal cells into brain and tumor tissue, respectively. It is also shown that there is a considerable variation in the rate of BCA destruction in cocultures of glioma spheroids generated directly from biopsy specimens. This variation is seen both between spheroids generated from the same biopsy as well as between spheroids that are grown from different biopsy specimens. Cell proliferation measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy samples obtained in the same patients revealed a correlation between tumor cell proliferation and tissue destruction of the BCAs, as determined by a reduction in BCA volume (p = 0.0338). No correlation was found when survival was related to the same parameters (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides a model for quick and efficient assessment of dynamic interactions between tumor and normal brain tissue shortly after surgery.

TI  - Renal angiotensin converting enzyme promotes renal damage during ureteral obstruction.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We and others have shown that angiotensin II has a pivotal role in renal damage in various renal injuries. Although most angiotensin II actions are associated with the angiotensin type 1 receptor, there is increasing evidence that the angiotensin type 2 receptor also transduces some important effects of angiotensin II. In this regard we recently observed that mice with genetically engineered disruption of the angiotensin type 2 receptor, termed Agtr2 mutants, are more susceptible to structural renal damage after ureteral obstruction. Recent evidence suggests that a genetically determined increase in angiotensin converting enzyme activity in humans promotes end organ damage. Therefore, we determined whether renal damage in Agtr2 mutants is associated with heightened angiotensin converting enzyme activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 28 wild type and 19 Agtr2 mutant mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction. Seven days after obstruction was created serum samples were obtained to evaluate angiotensin converting enzyme activity. The obstructed and contralateral kidneys were harvested for histological analysis and determination of renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Renal angiotensin converting enzyme was uniformly higher than serum angiotensin converting enzyme in normal wild type and Agtr2 mutant mice. However, even at baseline Agtr2 mutant mice had strikingly higher renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity than normal wild type mice (mean plus or minus standard error 1,492+/-83 versus 450+/-60 milliunits per gm. tissue weight, p <0.0005). Histological analysis revealed more extensive parenchymal damage in the obstructed kidneys of mutant mice than in identically treated controls. Notably while unilateral ureteral obstruction decreased renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity in each group, activity remained persistently higher in the Agtr2 mutants than in normal mice (mean 742+/-146 versus 310+/-43 milliunits per gm. tissue weight, p <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that elevated renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity contributes to more severe renal parenchymal damage in ureteral obstruction by promoting the availability of growth factors, such as angiotensin II, or depleting antiproliferation factors, such as bradykinin or nitric oxide. These findings complement previous observations that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition preserves the renal parenchyma after injury, including obstruction.

TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of preservative combinations in South African brown bread.  
AB  - Rope and mould spoilage decrease the shelf life of bread and may result in substantial monetary losses to producers. Five test bakes were carried out to determine the efficacy of sodium diacetate or vinegar in combination with calcium propionate, in inhibiting rope and mould spoilage of brown bread. Their effect on yeast activity was also evaluated. Baked loaves were stored at 30 degrees C and analysed for 6 days post-baking by duplicate plate counting, viable staining using 0.5% tetrazolium salt solution, mould-free shelf life determination and pH measurement. Changes in bacterial counts over time were used to rank treatments statistically. Vinegar combined with calcium propionate at 0.10% each achieved the longest rope-free shelf life, while 0.30% calcium propionate resulted in the longest mould-free shelf life. A combination of sodium diacetate and calcium propionate at 0.10% each showed the lowest reduction in yeast activity.

TI  - Bismuth carbomer foam enemas for active chronic pouchitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bismuth carbomer liquid enemas are equivalent to mesalamine enemas for active distal ulcerative colitis. AIMS: In this study, the efficacy and safety of bismuth carbomer foam enemas for active chronic pouchitis was determined in a placebo-controlled trial. PATIENTS: Forty adult patients with active chronic pouchitis were randomly assigned into either concurrent therapy for pouchitis or no concurrent therapy. Topical corticosteroids and mesalamine were withdrawn prior to the study. METHODS: Patients received either bismuth carbomer (270 mg elemental bismuth) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) foam enemas for 3 weeks. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline and at 3 weeks using the pouchitis disease activity index score which incorporates symptoms, endoscopy and histology. Serum bismuth concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. RESULTS: At 3 weeks nine of 20 patients (45%) in both the bismuth and placebo groups had improved. Ten patients discontinued prematurely because of worse diarrhoea (three in each group) or abdominal cramping after enema use (one from the bismuth group and three from the placebo group). No other side-effects were noted. Serum bismuth concentrations were negligible in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bismuth carbomer foam enemas (270 mg bismuth) nightly for 3 weeks are safe but not efficacious for active chronic pouchitis.

TI  -  Determination of the wavelength dependence of the differential pathlength factor from near-infrared pulse signals.  
AB  - For the calculation of changes in oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and the redox state of cytochrome-c-oxidase from attenuation data via a modified Beer-Lambert equation the wavelength dependence of the differential pathlength factor (DPF(lambda)) has to be taken into account. The DPF, i.e. the ratio of the mean optical pathlength and the physical light source-detector separation at each wavelength, determines the crosstalk between the different concentrations and is therefore essential for a sensitive detection of chromophore changes. Here a simple method is suggested to estimate the wavelength dependence of the DPF(lambda) from pulse-induced attenuation changes measured on the head of adult humans. The essence is that the DPF is the ratio of the attenuation changes over absorption coefficient changes, and that the spectral form of the pulse correlated absorption coefficient change can be assumed to be proportional to the extinction coefficient of blood. Indicators for the validity of the DPF(lambda) derived for wavelengths between 700 and 970 nm are the stability of the calculated haemoglobin and cytochrome signals with variations of the wavelength range included for their calculation and its overall agreement with the data available from the literature.

TI  - Quantification of desferrioxamine, ferrioxamine and aluminoxamine by post-column derivatization high-performance liquid chromatography. Non-linear calibration resulting from second-order reaction kinetics.  
AB  - Desferrioxamine B is widely used as therapeutic agent for removal of excess body iron and, more recently, for removal of aluminium. A HPLC-based method for direct sensitive and reliable determination of ferrioxamine, desferrioxamine, aluminoxamine and related metabolites has been developed for use in pharmacokinetic studies. The method consists of complete separation of the analytes by an optimized mobile phase avoiding conversion of desferrioxamine to ferrioxamine by the analytical system and overcoming problems due to peak tailing properties of desferrioxamine. A post-column derivatization reaction with colourless fluoro-complexed iron converts all iron free species to ferrioxamine and allows quantification at 430 nm avoiding interference of UV-absorbing coelutes. This reaction might be of interest for other analytical procedures concerning iron chelators. The influence of the post-column reaction system on the column plate number is characterized. As the reaction rate of desferrioxamine and aluminoxamine with iron(III) is of second-order kinetics, a quadratic calibration function is observed, resulting from a compromise between residence time and peak broadening. A solid-phase extraction procedure is presented for extraction of the analytes from plasma. Limits of detection (S/N ratio of 3) were determined as 1.95 ng for ferrioxamine, 3.9 ng for aluminoxamine and 15.7 ng for desferrioxamine, expressed as on-column load. A new iron-free metabolite was identified with fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as N-hydroxylated desferrioxamine.

TI  - Effect of yeast culture and phenolic acids on the physiology of rumen fermentation determined in vitro.  
AB  - The effect of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA), syringic acid (SYA) and yeast culture (YS) on rumen fermentation in vitro has been investigated. Meadow hay was used as a substrate and rumen fluid as an inocula. The yeast culture Levucel contained 5x10(8) yeast cells Saccharomyces cerevisiae per 1 g of dry matter and was used in the amount of 0.5 g/l of the medium. The following combinations of additives were used: hay without additive, hay + YS, hay with 1, 5 or 10 mmol HBA or SYA, and hay + YS with 1, 5 or 10 mmol HBA or SYA. The test tubes were incubated for 96 hours at 39 degrees C. The results showed that 1 mmol HBA had a significant effect on yeast efficacy. This was manifested in the increased degradability of hay dry matter (P <0.05) and enhanced total gas production (P<0.05). SYA in the same amount combined with yeast had a similar effect on gas production (P<0.05), but hay dry matter degradability was not affected. The results showed a slight effect of phenolic acids and yeast culture on hay rumen fermentation in vitro.

TI  - Molt-inhibiting hormone mRNA levels and ecdysteroid titer during a molt cycle of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus.  
AB  - Synthesis of ecdysteroid molting hormones by crustacean Y-organs is believed to be regulated by a neuropeptide, molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), produced in eyestalk neural ganglia. In the present study, steady-state MIH mRNA and hemolymph ecdysteroid levels were determined by Northern blot and radioimmunoassay, respectively, during the molt cycle of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. The level of MIH mRNA dropped steadily during premolt (D1-D4), reaching a minimum in D3/D4, then increased by 10-fold in postmolt (A/B) and remained elevated during intermolt (C4). These stage-specific changes in MIH mRNA levels were accompanied by significant fluctuations in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. The ecdysteroid titer increased steadily to a peak of 377.0 ng/ml in D3 of premolt, then dropped to 120.0 ng/ml in D4 (just prior to molting), and was low during postmolt (A/B, 4.4 ng/ml) and intermolt (C4, 3.3 ng/ml). The results represent the first report of developmental changes in MIH gene expression and are generally consistent with the hypothesis that MIH negatively regulates ecdysteroid synthesis in crustaceans.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of combination therapy with nelfinavir plus nevirapine [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (NFV) administered alone and in combination with nevirapine (NVP) to HIV-positive patients. DESIGN: Seven patients with advanced HIV disease received dual nucleoside analogues in addition to NFV (750 mg three times daily) and subsequently NVP (200 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily) as salvage therapy. On the first study day (day 3), blood samples were taken for assay of NFV. The second study day followed the introduction of NVP for 3 weeks. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h after dosing on both study days. Separated plasma was heated to 58 degrees C for 30 min to inactivate HIV and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis by high performance liquid chromatography for both NFV and NVP. RESULTS: The geometric mean NFV area under the concentration-time curve to 8 h (AUC0-8h) was 23.4 microg x h/ml (range, 13.5-49.2) and 11.6 microg x h/ml (range, 6.6-23.2) on the first and second study days, respectively. The geometric mean ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.72; P = 0.016). This represented a 50% reduction in plasma NFV concentrations. Maximum and minimum concentrations were also reduced during NVP therapy (from 4.4 to 2.5 microg/ml and from 1.7 to 0.8 microg/ml, respectively). Time to maximum concentration was reduced from 4 to 2 h. NVP concentrations were determined with a maximum concentration of 5.4 microg/ml at 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: NVP is currently being used in combination therapy with protease inhibitors for antiretroviral-experienced patients in the setting of treatment failure. This study demonstrates that when patients are coadministered NVP there is a 50% reduction in the plasma AUC of NFV. Although the mean trough concentrations of NFV remained above the stated minimum effective concentration of 0.4 microg/ml, there is nevertheless concern that some patients will fall below this value when NVP is added to treatment regimens. In the absence of therapeutic drug monitoring we suggest that an increase in the standard NFV dosage of 750 mg three times daily will be required to ensure satisfactory NFV plasma concentrations, thereby maintaining antiviral efficacy.

TI  - The Deinococcus radiodurans uvr A gene: identification of mutation sites in two mitomycin-sensitive strains and the first discovery of insertion sequence element from deinobacteria.  
AB  - Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr) possesses a prominent ability to repair the DNA injury induced by various DNA-damaging agents including mitomycin C (MC), ultraviolet light (UV) and ionizing radiation. DNA damage resistance was restored in MC sensitive (MC(S)) mutants 2621 and 3021 by transforming with DNAs of four cosmid clones derived from the gene library of strain KD8301, which showed wild type (wt) phenotype to DNA-damaging agents. Gene affected by mutation (mtcA or mtcB) in both mutants was cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the gene product consists of 1016 aa and shares homology with many bacterial UvrA proteins. The mutation sites of both mutants were identified by analyzing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments derived from the genomic DNA of the mutants. A 144-base pair (bp) deletion including the start codon for the uvrA gene was observed in DNA of the mutant 3021, causing a defect in the gene. On the other hand, an insertion sequence (IS) element intervened in the uvrA gene of the mutant 2621, suggesting the insertional inactivation of the gene. The IS element comprises 1322-bp long, flanked by 19-bp inverted terminal repeats (ITR), and generated a 6-bp target duplication (TD). Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found in the IS element. The deduced aa sequences of large and small ORFs show homology to a putative transposase found in IS4 of Escherichia coli (Ec) and to a resolvase found in ISXc5 of Xanthomonas campestris (Xc), respectively. This is the first discovery of IS element in deinobacteria, and the IS element was designated IS2621.

TI  - Progesterone implants delay age-related declines in regular estrous cyclicity and the ovarian follicular reserve in Long-Evans rats.  
AB  - The present study examined the effects of progesterone (P4) treatments on estrous cyclicity and the loss of ovarian follicles during aging. Young rats received repeated treatments with P4 or empty implants between 3.5 and 8 mo of age. At 8 mo, ovaries were obtained from some animals to determine the numbers of resting follicles, and estrous cycle patterns and hormone levels were determined from other groups of treated females. In contrast to the cyclic increases in P4, estradiol (E2), LH, and FSH in control animals, P4-implanted rats exhibited elevated serum P4 but low E2, LH, and FSH levels. After implant treatments, the follicular reserve was significantly (p < 0.05) larger in P4-treated females (2012 +/- 297 resting follicles per ovary, n = 5 rats per group) than in regularly cyclic control rats (713 +/- 226 follicles per ovary, n = 7). The effects of P4 implants on the follicular reserve were associated with a subsequently higher incidence of regular estrous cycles after P4 treatment. These results demonstrate that P4 prevents cyclic increases in E2 secretion and is associated with a conservation of the ovarian follicular reserve and the maintenance of regular estrous cycle patterns, indicating a protective effect of P4 on the age-related loss of ovarian follicles.

TI  - Effect of beta-blockade on regional left ventricular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - It has been reported that beta-blockade has beneficial effects on the cardiac function and prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure. However, the mechanism for these effects remained unclear. This study compared the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 2.5 to 5.0 mg/day, or delapril, 15 to 30 mg/day) alone with the effects of beta-blockade therapy (metoprolol, 40 to 60 mg/day) coupled with an ACE inhibitor on global and regional left ventricular (LV) function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the global LV ejection fraction (EF), regional EF (rEF), and regional ejection time (rET) were determined by sector analysis of the radionuclide ventriculogram before and after therapy (duration 14 +/- 9 months). The coefficients of variation of rEF and rET were calculated as indexes of the heterogeneity of regional LV systolic wall motion. EF increased significantly from 20% +/- 8% to 30% +/- 8% (p < 0.05) in patients who received beta-blockade and an ACE inhibitor (n = 5). Furthermore, the coefficients of variation of rET decreased from 27% +/- 13% to 16% +/- 7% (p < 0.05). In contrast, patients treated with an ACE inhibitor only (n = 7) showed no significant improvements in any of these parameters. These results suggest that, compared with an ACE inhibitor alone, beta-blockade improves global and regional LV function in dilated cardiomyopathy by synchronizing myocardial contraction.

TI  - The fluoride concentration in the drinking water of towns in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal.  
AB  - In previous studies the water fluoride content of the larger cities in South Africa, and smaller towns in the Cape Province were recorded. This project was extended to include smaller towns (500 or more inhabitants) in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal. Drinking water was collected in polypropylene containers and the fluoride content determined potentiometrically. The information obtained made it possible to compile a table setting out the fluoride content of the drinking water in these smaller towns. The study confirms a previous observation that water from boreholes has the highest (p < 0.05), and fountains the lowest fluoride content.
