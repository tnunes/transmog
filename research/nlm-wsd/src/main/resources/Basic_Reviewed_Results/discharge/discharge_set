TI  - From clinical trials to clinical practice: oral anticoagulation among patients with non-rheumatic, atrial fibrillation.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the results of clinical trials on the prophylactic treatment of non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with oral anticoagulants. METHODS: Retrospectively, we studied a random sample of 375 patients discharged from our hospital with a diagnosis of non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation between 1991 and 1993. Information about diagnoses, other clinical variables and treatments prescribed at discharge was obtained from the hospital medical records. RESULTS: During the whole study period, 14% of patients were prescribed an oral anticoagulant agent and 17% were prescribed acetylsalicylic acid. A non-significant increase in the proportion of patients prescribed oral anticoagulant drugs, from 9% to 17%, was observed. Multivariate analysis showed that a history of stroke (OR = 5.96) and younger age were significantly associated with the prescription of oral anticoagulants. ASA prescription was strongly associated with a history of concomitant vascular disease (OR = 5.8), but not with other risk factors for stroke. Sixty-five percent of patients had one or more risk factors for stroke, did not present any contraindications to anticoagulant agents, but nevertheless were not prescribed one of these drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant agents and acetylsalicylic acid were largely underprescribed to patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, and oral anticoagulants were not prescribed according to the individual patients' risk of stroke.

TI  - Influence of adenosine, dipyridamole, adenosine antagonists and antiepileptic drugs on EEG after discharge following cortical stimulation.  
AB  - The effects of adenosine (100 nM, icv), dipyridamole (DPM, 5 mg/kg, i.p.), adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-theophylline (8-CPT, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), and aminophylline (AMP) and caffeine (CAF) (at equivalent doses of 35 mg/kg, i.p.), were examined in rats. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were also administered i.p., viz, carbamazepine (CBZ, 10 mg/kg); phenobarbitone (PB, 10 mg/kg); phenytoin (PHT, 20 mg/kg); valproic acid (VPA, 300 mg/kg); and diazepam (DZP, 10 mg/kg), to study their effects on EEG after discharge (AD) and postictal depression (PID) induced by cortical stimulation. The AD parameters: (1) duration of EEG-AD (sec) and (2) number of spikes was noted both during pre and post drug treatment sessions. Adenosine and DPM had no special effects on AD parameters but showed significant prolongation of PID. All the adenosine antagonists, 8-CPT, AMP and CAF produced significant prolongation of AD duration, increase in number of spikes and reduced the duration of PID to a significant extent. Interestingly, some of the AEDs, viz. CBZ, VPA and DZP showed abolition of all the EEG-AD parameters whereas PB and PHT failed to show any significant effect. The results confirm previous findings on involvement of adenosine in postictal events.

TI  - Development of latent fingerprints using a corona discharge.  
AB  - A novel technique for the development of latent fingerprints is presented. It is based on placing a fingerprint-bearing object inside a corona discharge induced plasma. The development of various real and artificial fingerprints on metallic substrates under a wide range of conditions is studied. Using the results of the development experiments and the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is shown that the development is based on oxidation of the fingerprint background. This is achieved by strong oxidizers generated by the discharge process, while saturated fatty-acids found in sebaceous fingerprints protect the area beneath them, resulting in a visible fingerprint. The process is optimized by minimizing the electrode gap distance and maximizing the peak discharge voltage and the pulse repetition frequency.

TI  - Effects of botulinum neurotoxin type A on abducens motoneurons in the cat: alterations of the discharge pattern.  
AB  -  The discharge characteristics that abducens motoneurons exhibit after paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle with botulinum neurotoxin type A were studied in the alert cat. Antidromically identified motoneurons were recorded during both spontaneous and vestibularly induced eye movements. A single injection of 0.3 ng/kg produced a complete paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle lasting for about 12-15 days, whereas after 3 ng/kg the paralysis was still complete at the longest time checked, three months. Motoneurons recorded under the effect of the low dose showed differences in their sensitivities to both eye position and velocity according to the direction of the previous and ongoing movements, respectively. These directional differences could be explained by post-saccadic adaptation of the non-injected eye in the appropriate direction for reducing ocular misalignment. Thus, backward and forward post-saccadic drifts accompanied on- and off-directed saccades, respectively. The magnitude of the drift was similar to the magnitude of changes in eye position sensitivity. The discharge of the high-dose-treated motoneurons could be described in a three-stage sequence. During the initial 10-12 days, motoneuronal discharge resembled the effects of axotomy, particularly in the loss of tonic signals and the presence of exponential-like decay of firing after saccades. In this stage, the conduction velocity of abducens motoneurons was reduced by 21.4%. The second stage was characterized by an overall reduction in firing rate towards a tonic firing at 15-70 spikes/s. Motoneurons remained almost unmodulated for all types of eye movement and thus eye position and velocity sensitivities were significantly reduced. Tonic firing ceased only when the animal became drowsy, but was restored by alerting stimuli. In addition, the inhibition of firing for off-directed saccades was more affected than the burst excitation during on-directed saccades, since in many cells pauses were almost negligible. These alterations could not be explained by adaptational changes in the movement of the non-injected eye. Finally, after 60 days the initial stages of recovery were observed. The present results indicate that the high dose of botulinum neurotoxin produces effects on the motoneuron not attributable to the functional disconnection alone, but to a direct effect of the neurotoxin in the motoneuron and/or its synaptic inputs.

TI  - Lack of value of routine postpartum hematocrit determination after vaginal delivery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with low postpartum hematocrits after vaginal delivery and to define lower risk categories of patients for whom routine determination of hematocrit may not be necessary. METHODS: This case-control study was designed to identify risk factors for discharge hematocrit below 27% in nonanemic patients after a vaginal delivery using the University of California, San Francisco, Perinatal Database. Multivariate statistics were used to determine the most significant risk factors. Lower risk subpopulations were analyzed to determine their rate of low discharge hematocrits. RESULTS: Risk factors associated with odds ratios greater than 1.5 for discharge hematocrit less than 27% included estimated blood loss greater than 500 mL, placenta previa, abruption, prolonged third stage, preeclampsia, prior postpartum hemorrhage, and prior cesarean delivery. Estimated blood loss > 500 mL was the most significant risk factor for discharge hematocrit less than 27% (odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 3.8, 5.4). A population without statistically significant risk factors was identified; this group had a 1.4% risk of discharge hematocrit less than 27%. CONCLUSION: Routine postpartum hematocrits are unnecessary in clinically stable patients with an estimated blood loss of less than 500 mL.

TI  - Rapid hospital discharge following laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy. A promise unfulfilled?  
AB  - This study was done to determine whether laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy in the United States is associated with rapid postoperative discharge, defined as 2 days or less, and to estimate how often ambulatory treatment of ectopic pregnancy occurs without subsequent hospital admission. We used the National Hospital Discharge Survey to estimate the frequency of ectopic pregnancy admissions, operations, and length of hospital stays in 1990. We used the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to estimate the number, type, and disposition of office visits for ectopic pregnancy in 1990. According to National Hospital Discharge Survey data, tubal pregnancy led to an estimated 57,000 hospital admissions in 1990. Most (70%) of the 26,000 patients treated with laparoscopy were in the hospital 3 days or more, and most (73%) underwent salpingectomy. The number of ambulatory visits for ectopic pregnancy was too low to estimate reliably according to the standards of the National Center for Health Statistics. We found that laparoscopy was used frequently for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy but was not associated with rapid postoperative discharge. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings persist and whether reimbursement incentives, patient preference, or problems with the diffusion of technology are responsible.

TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis and open groin hernia repair [see comments]  
AB  - Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely given for nonimplant, clean operations, although this view has recently been challenged. We have conducted a randomized multicenter, double-blind prospective trial to compare co-amoxiclav with placebo in 619 patients undergoing open groin hernia repair. Altogether 563 (91%) patients fulfilled the protocol; 283 received co-amoxiclav and 280 placebo. There was no difference between the groups in the number of patients receiving local or general anesthetic, the type of repair performed, the use of a subcutaneous fat suture, the type of skin closure used, the use of wound analgesia, or the use of a wound drain. Patients were given a card to return to the hospital in the event of their wound discharging or their needing to see their general practitioner. All patients were reviewed at approximately 6 weeks after operation. Fifty (8.9%) patients sustained a wound infection, 25 in the co-amoxiclav group and 25 in the placebo group. We conclude that antibiotic prophylaxis is of no benefit to patients undergoing open groin hernia repair.

TI  - A comparison between emergency diagnostic and treatment unit and inpatient care in the management of acute asthma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency diagnostic and treatment units (EDTUs) may provide an alternative to hospitalization for patients with reversible diseases, such as asthma, who fail to adequately respond to emergency department therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the medical and cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and quality of life of patients receiving EDTU care for acute asthma compared with inpatient care. METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical trial performed at 2 urban public hospitals enrolled patients with acute asthma (age range, 18-55 years) not meeting discharge criteria after 3 hours of emergency department therapy. Patients were treated with inhaled adrenergic agonists and steroids in an EDTU for up to 9 hours after randomization or with routine therapy in a hospital ward. Patients were followed up for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discharge rate from the EDTU, length of stay, relapse rates, days missed from work or school, days incapacitated during waking hours, symptom-free days and nights, nocturnal awakenings, direct medical costs, patients satisfaction, and patient quality of life. RESULTS: The study consisted of 222 patients with asthma. Sixty-five patients (59%) treated in an EDTU were discharged home; the remainder were admitted to the hospital. There were no differences during the follow-up period in relapse rates (P = .74) or in any other morbidities between the EDTU and inpatient groups. There were significant differences in the length of stay, patient satisfaction, and quality of life favoring EDTU care. The mean (+/-SD) cost per patient in the EDTU group was $1202.79 +/- $1343.96, compared with $2247.32 +/- $1110.18 for the control group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of selected patients with asthma in an EDTU results in the safe discharge of most such patients. This study suggests that quality gains and cost-effective measures can be achieved by the use of such units.

TI  - Conscious sedation and implantable devices. Safe and effective sedation during pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement.  
AB  - There is a paucity of research on the use of CS during ICD or pacemaker implantation. Pacemaker patients generally require small amounts of i.v. sedation, in conjunction with local anesthetic agents, to relieve incisional discomfort. Because of innovations in ICD technology, little difference now exists between ICD and pacemaker placement. Studies have reported on the use of deep sedation during ICD implantations, but only one study addressed CS in ICD placement. Whether deep levels of sedation are necessary for DFT testing is not apparent from these studies. Two studies report giving sedation at a level consistent with deep sedation, yet partial loss of protective reflexes was not reported in one of the studies. Further research is needed to explore the use of sedation in ICD implantation. It may be that deep sedation for patient comfort is necessary only during DFT testing or for tunneling of leads to an abdominal generator site, and that CS is more than appropriate for the implant portion of the procedure. Research may disclose that agents such as midazolam and, to some extent propofol, provide an amnesic effect that may mitigate the need for deep sedation during DFT testing or lead tunneling. Another benefit of agents and analgesics such as Fentanyl, is the relatively short duration of sedation, which minimizes recovery time. Patients recover quicker than with general anesthesia and can be discharged the same day in some procedures (e.g., generator replacement). Cost-benefit studies also are needed to compare the cost of anesthesiologist-delivered sedation with that of nurse-administered sedation. A comparison study could explore complication rates, patient comfort, and costs for the two sedation delivery methods.

The present experiments were to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the discharge activity of temperature-sensitive neurons of preoptic-anterior hypothalamus (PO-AH) in rabbits treated by AVP and arginine vasopressin monoclonal antibody (AVPMcAb). The results were as follows: (1) AVP could markedly promote the firing activity of EA on heat-sensitive neurons in PO-AH. (2) AVPMcAb could markedly reduce the effect of EA on temperature-sensitive neurons in PO-AH. Experimental results indicated that the mechanisms of EA on hypothermia might be related to AVP.

TI  - Implantable left ventricular assist devices provide an excellent outpatient bridge to transplantation and recovery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our recent experience with outpatient left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is presented to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of long-term outpatient mechanical circulatory assistance. BACKGROUND: The experience with inpatient LVAD support as a bridge to transplantation has proved the efficacy of such therapy in improving circulatory hemodynamic status, restoring normal end-organ function and facilitating patient rehabilitation. With miniaturization of the power supplies and controllers, such mechanical circulatory support can now be accomplished in an outpatient setting. METHODS: Between March 1993 and February 1997, 32 patients (26 male, 6 female, mean [+/-SEM] age 49 +/- 15 years) underwent implantation of the ThermoCardiosystems (TCI) Heartmate vented electric (VE) LVAD. The VE LVAD is powered by batteries worn on shoulder holsters and is operated by a belt-mounted system controller, allowing unrestricted patient ambulation and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Mean duration of support was 122 +/- 26 days (range 3 to 605), with a survival rate to transplantation or explantation of 78%. Nineteen patients were discharged from the hospital on mean postoperative day 41 +/- 4 (range 17 to 68), for an outpatient support time of 108 +/- 30 days (range 2 to 466). Four patients underwent early transplantation and could not participate in the discharge program, and three patients currently await discharge. The complication rate was not statistically different from that encountered in our previous 52 patients with a pneumatic LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient LVAD support is safe and provides improved quality of life for patients awaiting transplantation. Wearable and totally implantable LVADs should be studied as permanent treatment options for patients who are not candidates for heart transplantation.

TI  - A comparison of methods used to detect changes in neuronal discharge patterns.  
AB  - The discharge pattern of two thalamic neurones was recorded from a conscious monkey performing voluntary movements about the wrist joint. The neuronal discharge was displayed as a raster centred on movement of the wrist. The discharge patterns of both neurones was very strongly correlated with movement. Three experienced researchers were asked to examine the data and to classify every part of each trial as background discharge, 'on' (increased firing rate) or 'off' (decreased or zero firing rate) and to mark the times that neuronal discharge changed state. A 'standard output' was made from these classifications. A back-propagation artificial Neural Network (the Network) was used to model the standard output and cumulative sums (CUSUMs) and maximum likelihood was then performed on the data and compared with the Network. There was a high correlation between the output of each observer (r > 0.61) and the standard output and between the Network and the standard output (r > 0.99). However the correlation between standard output and CUSUMs (r = 0.06) and standard output and maximum likelihood (r = 0.36) was much lower. The Network could be trained with as few as 12 trials, indicating a high degree of constancy in the methods employed by the observers. The Network was also highly efficient at detecting changes in state of neuronal activity (r > 0.99). In summary, when used on single trial data, visual inspection is a reliable method for detecting timing of change neuronal discharge and is superior to CUSUM and maximum likelihood. As well it is capable of detecting neuronal discharge state: that is whether firing rate is increased, normal or decreased. Neural Networks promise to be a useful method of confirming the consistency of visual inspection as a means of detecting changes in neuronal discharge pattern.

We postulate that septal cholinergic and GABAergic rhythmically bursting cells fire in relative synchrony; their coordinated burst discharge (burst mode) drives the positive-going phase of intracellular theta and associated firing of pyramidal cells; their synchronized pauses (interburst mode) give rise to the negative-going phase of intracellular theta and an inhibition of pyramidal cells.

TI  - Brainstem-diencephalo-septohippocampal systems controlling the theta rhythm of the hippocampus.  
AB  - We present a new model for the generation of theta rhythm of the hippocampus. We propose that theta at CA1 involves extracellular current fluxes produced by alternating depolarizing and hyperpolarizing membrane potential fluctuations of large populations of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Pyramidal cells are, in turn, controlled by rhythmically bursting cholinergic and GABAergic cells of the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band. We postulate that septal cholinergic and GABAergic rhythmically bursting cells fire in relative synchrony; their coordinated burst discharge (burst mode) drives the positive-going phase of intracellular theta and associated firing of pyramidal cells; their synchronized pauses (interburst mode) give rise to the negative-going phase of intracellular theta and an inhibition of pyramidal cells. We further demonstrate that the theta rhythm is controlled by a network of cells extending from the brainstem to the septum/hippocampus. During theta, tonically discharging cells of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis activate neurons of the supramammillary nucleus; the supramammillary nucleus, in turn, converts this steady barrage into a rhythmical pattern of discharge which is relayed to GABAergic/ cholinergic rhythmically bursting cells of the medial septum. The septal rhythmically bursting cells modulate subsets of hippocampal interneurons and principal cells in the generation of the theta rhythm. We review evidence showing that the serotonin-containing neurons of the median raphe nucleus desynchronize the hippocampal electroencephalogram, presumably by disrupting the rhythmical discharge of septal cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. Finally, we summarize recent work indicating that the theta rhythm is critically involved in memory functions of the hippocampus and that its disruption (electroencephalographic desynchronization) may block or temporarily suspend mnemonic processes of the hippocampus.

TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia: can it be defined with claims data?  
AB  - The use of administrative data to study pneumonia is limited because International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) diagnosis codes do not specify whether pneumonia is community-acquired (CAP), a key clinical distinction. We classified 212 patients discharged with a diagnosis code for pneumonia as to whether or not they had CAP, using three administrative data-based systems (Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) alone, principal diagnosis alone, and a complex algorithm). We examined agreement with classification by clinician chart review. We also compared the length of stay (LOS) and mortality among the CAP populations identified with different methods. Agreement between the clinical review and the three administrative data methods ranged from 86 to 80%. Classification by DRG performed least well. Populations defined by claims data had similar mortality but shorter mean LOS (9.70, 9.40, and 7.91 days for the algorithm, principal diagnosis and DRG methods, respectively) than the clinically defined population (10.85 days). We conclude that studies of CAP using populations identified by claims may underestimate LOS.

TI  - Postnatal inositol levels in preterm infants.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma inositol levels in preterm infants fed formula containing inositol at levels close to those in human milk. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma inositol levels were measured in 72 preterm infants fed formula containing 1110 mumol/L inositol and in cord blood of 12 healthy term infants. Preterm infant plasma levels were measured four times: (1) within the first 7 days of life, (2) intermediate enteral feeding, (3) at hospital discharge, and (4) 2 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Inositol concentrations in term cord blood samples were significantly lower than in preterm initial feeding, intermediate feeding, and discharge samples. Initial concentrations in blood of preterm infants were higher than in all other groups, and were significantly lower among infants with gestational ages of 31 to 33 weeks compared with those of 28 to 30 or 31 to 33 weeks. Days of parenteral nutrition were a significant predictor of inositol levels in the full feeding sample, with lower levels associated with prolonged parenteral nutrition. Clinical outcomes were not related to plasma inositol levels. CONCLUSIONS: Feeding preterm formula with inositol levels close to those reported for human milk may not prevent the postnatal decline in preterm infant plasma inositol levels.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the discharge information needs and symptom distress of people after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery. Interviews (N = 51) were conducted prior to, and 4 weeks after, hospital discharge. People indicated that the most important information to help them manage their care after discharge related to the recognition, prevention and management of complications. Broken sleep and incisional pain were the most distressful of symptoms prior to hospital discharge, whereas fatigue and broken sleep were most distressful once home. These results may assist nurses to understand the discharge information needs and symptom distress of people recovering from aortic reconstructive surgery and the importance of discharge education to help people to manage their care once home.

TI  - Midaortic pseudoaneurysm complicating extensive endovascular stenting of aortic disease.  
AB  - We report a case of successful surgical management of a potentially life-threatening complication of aortoiliac stent placement. A 59-year-old man who had Leriche syndrome underwent bilateral iliac artery and infrarenal aortic stent placement at another institution. His history was significant for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at 19 years of age for testicular cancer. One week after stent placement, the patient was readmitted with abdominal pain, poor oral intake, and diffuse intermittent tenderness. Evaluation with computed tomographic scanning and endoscopy was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged. He was admitted to our institution 1 week later with persistent abdominal pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a large pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta. The patient underwent urgent exploration, and exclusion of his infrarenal aorta was achieved with aortobifemoral bypass grafting. After the operation, the patient's course was complicated by a large paraduodenal hematoma, which resulted in a gastric outlet obstruction, which was managed without operation. This case illustrates a potential life-threatening complication of extensive stent placement for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Injury to the abdominal aorta must be considered in a symptomatic patient after the placement of stents in the aortoiliac region, beyond the immediate periprocedural period.

TI  - Living related donor liver transplantation.  
AB  - Living related liver transplantation (LRLT) has been developed in response to the paediatric organ donor shortage. According to the International Living Donor Registry, 521 transplants had been performed in 515 patients between December 8 1988 and January 19 1996 in 30 centres worldwide. The overall actuarial patient and graft survival rates were 82.7 and 80%, respectively. Between June 17 1994 and November 30 1996, the authors performed 11 LRLT at the Chung Gung Memorial Hospital. The living donors consisted of 10 mothers and one father. The mean graft weight was 303 g and the mean graft recipient weight ratio was 2.2%. Donor hepatectomy was performed without vascular inflow occlusion. The intra-operative blood loss ranged from 30 mL to 120 mL with an average of 61 mL, and blood transfusion was not required in all donors both intra-operatively and during the postoperative period. Underlying diseases of the recipients were biliary atresia (n = 10) and glycogen storage disease (n = 1). The mean graft cold ischaemia time was 106 min, the mean second warm ischaemia time was 51 min and the mean interval between portal and arterial reperfusion was 81 min. The initial LRLT results were promising with all donors having been discharged without complication. The recipients experienced a few complications, all of which were manageable with early intervention. All 11 recipients are alive and well. These are encouraging results and the authors hope to expand the use of live donors for liver transplantation to cope with demand.

TI  - [Nosocomial infections in surgical patients. Problems of measuring and comparing results]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: What is striking when studying the frequency of nosocomial infection (NI) is the variability of the study data. Different frequency indicators and infection criteria are used for estimates and these make it difficult to compare works. The aim of this work is to estimate the frequency of hospital infection by using different indicators to compare the results. METHODS: A market study was carried out including patients admitted to four surgical units over the period of one year. The following indicators were used: proportion of patients infected, cumulative number of cases of infection and density of number of cases. The infections were detected through active search and included those acquired in Intensive Care Units and those diagnosed after patients had been discharged from hospital. RESULTS: A total of 14.5% of the patients suffered NI and 5% of the infections were diagnosed after discharge from hospital. In 38.5% of the cases of infection a microbiological study was not requested. The General Surgery Unit had the highest figures for the three indicators. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the differences between services was modified in line with the indicator used. CONCLUSIONS: The real percentage of patients with NI is higher than the values given by the usual monitoring systems. Given the trend witnessed over recent years whereby the length of hospital stays is being reduced and early discharge programmes promoted with the aim of increasing efficiency, densities for the number of cases should be estimated and these should include the NI cases diagnosed after hospital discharge in order to make valid comparisons between different institutions and periods of time.

TI  - Early supported hospital discharge following acute stroke: pilot study results.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the feasibility and method of evaluation of an early supported hospital discharge policy for patients with acute stroke. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial comparing an early supported discharge service to conventional care. SETTING: Three acute hospitals in Newcastle upon Tyne. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two eligible patients with acute stroke admitted between 1 February 1995 and 31 January 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Placement, length of stay, readmission rates, mortality, functional ability (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale), handicap (Oxford Handicap Scale), global health status (Dartmouth Coop Function Charts) and carer stress (General Health Questionnaire 30 item). RESULTS: The median length of stay for patients randomized to early supported discharge was 13 days compared to 22 days in the conventional care group (p = 0.02). The median Barthel ADL index at seven days post stroke of patients randomized to early supported discharge was 15, and 13 for those randomized to conventional care (NS). At three months post stroke the median Nottingham EADL score of patients randomized to early supported discharge was 10 compared to 7 for those who received conventional care (NS). There were no statistically significant differences in the global health status of patients or carer stress. CONCLUSION: An early supported discharge service following acute stroke with individualized rehabilitation in the community is feasible and can be evaluated by a randomized controlled trial but a larger multicentre trial is needed before such a service is widely adopted.

TI  - Hospitalization of children born to human immunodeficiency virus-infected women in Europe. The European Collaborative Study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern of inpatient hospital service use in the first 5 years of life of all children born to HIV-infected women in 10 pediatric centers of the European Collaborative Study. BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the need for hospitalization of children born to HIV-infected women, especially those uninfected, despite the fact that they may be at risk of social deprivation and poor health because of family circumstances. METHODS: Data on 1189 children enrolled between 1986 and 1997 and followed prospectively since birth according to a standard protocol were analyzed. RESULTS: This analysis included 151 HIV-infected and 811 uninfected children. One hundred forty (12%) infants had delayed postnatal discharge, mainly for drug withdrawal symptoms and prematurity. Uninfected children had 0.5 admission per 5 child years compared with 2.4 for infected children. From life table analysis, an estimated 48% of infected and 17% of uninfected children will have been admitted by age 12 months. Nearly 60% (3304 of 5604) of the total inpatient days of infected children occurred after AIDS diagnosis. Infected children were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized than uninfected children of the same age, and children with symptomatic mothers were 13 times more likely to be admitted for a nonmedical reason. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas hospitalization of infected children poses an expected burden on the health care system, the use of such services by uninfected children is largely explained by their social background and provides an argument for better support for families affected by HIV.

TI  - [Multidimensional geriatric assessment in the acute hospital and ambulatory practice]  
AB  - Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is defined as a multidimensional medical, functional, psychosocial and environmental evaluation of an older person's problems and resources, linked with an overall plan for treatment and follow-up. It is well established that CGA implemented in specialized geriatric evaluation and management units improves function and survival in frail older patients. The results of new randomized controlled trials, however, show that the application of CGA does not only improve outcomes in selected older persons, but probably in most. A randomized controlled study in unselected older patients admitted to an acute care hospital found that patients function at hospital discharge was improved, and the risk of nursing home admissions decreased, in patients receiving integrated geriatric care as compared to patients receiving the usual acute hospital care. Another trial examined the impact of follow-up geriatric home-visits in patients with unstable cardiac failure discharged from the hospital. This trial found a statistically significant reduction of hospital readmissions and cost savings in the intervention group as compared with controls. A new application for CGA emerges in the preventive arena. Annual comprehensive geriatric assessments with preventive home visits in older people living at home resulted in fewer nursing home admissions and delayed or prevented the onset of disability in the activities of daily living in persons of the intervention group as compared to controls. One of the roles of geriatricians is teaching CGA and conducting further research with a view to refining CGA methodology and its application. Practical application of the principles of geriatric assessment and management, however, should not remain in the hand of specialists alone, but should become an integrated part of primary care medicine in the ambulatory and hospital settings.

TI  - Laparoscopic resection of solitary gastric schwannoma.  
AB  - We report a case of successful laparoscopic resection of a solitary schwannoma of the gastric fundus performed on emergency. The patient was a 52-year-old man who presented with an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. At admission, the endoscopy and hydro-CT scan showed a submucosal tumor, 2.5 cm in maximum diameter, with an area of central ulceration arising from the anterior wall of the gastric fundus. A wedge laparoscopic resection of the gastric wall was performed under endoscopic guidance. The defect in the anterior wall was repaired in part by linear stapler and in part using a continuous suture. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 4th postoperative day. Laparoscopic approach represents a safe and efficient approach for the treatment of benign tumors of the stomach, also on emergency basis.

TI  - Variability and correlated noise in the discharge of neurons in motor and parietal areas of the primate cortex.  
AB  - We analyzed the magnitude and interneuronal correlation of the variability in the activity of single neurons that were recorded simultaneously using a multielectrode array in the primary motor cortex and parietal areas 2/5 in rhesus monkeys. The animals were trained to move their arms in one of eight directions as instructed by a visual target. The relationship between variability (SD) and mean of the discharge rate was described by a power function with a similar exponent ( approximately 0.57), regardless of the cortical area or the behavioral condition. We examined whether the deviation from mean activity between target onset and the end of the movement was correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with variability in activity during the hold period before target onset. In both cortical areas, for about a quarter of the neurons, the neuronal noise of these two periods was positively correlated, whereas significant negative correlations were seldom observed. Overall, neurons with higher signal correlation (i.e., similar directional pattern) showed higher noise correlation in both cortical areas. On the other hand, when the data were divided according to the distance between the electrode tips from which the neurons were recorded, a consistent relationship between the signal and noise correlations was found only for pairs of neurons recorded through the same electrode. These results suggest that nearby neurons with similar directional tuning carry primarily redundant messages, whereas neurons in separate cortical columns perform more independent processing.

TI  - The psychosocial and physiological experiences of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.  
AB  - This article describes the relationships between anxiety, self-efficacy, as well as the psychosocial and physiological experiences of patients with an internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Although survival rates with ICDs are impressive, patients experience psychological and physiological responses to their lifesaving devices. Thirty-nine patients completed questionnaires during outpatient clinic visits. Patients' anxiety levels were correlated with fears about ICD malfunction, fear of death, fear of being shocked, loss of control, trouble related to sleeping, inability to concentrate, overprotective family members, and depression. Patients with physical symptoms had higher anxiety levels than those without physical symptoms. There was not a significant relationship between anxiety and discomfort associated with discharge, the number of discharges, or ejection fractions. Low self-efficacy was significantly related to fears about ICD malfunction as well as patients' inability to work, engage in hobbies, and drive a car. Patients with low self-efficacy had more physical symptoms and lower ejection fractions. There were no significant relationships between self-efficacy and frequency of ICD discharge or patients' discomfort during ICD discharge.

TI  - [Infection registration underestimates the frequency of surgical wound infection]  
AB  - Two consecutive bedside prevalence studies of 455 surgical patients were made by the same infection control nurse in 15 surgical and gynaecological departments in eight Danish hospitals. Four point six percent had a deep and another 4.6% a superficial surgical wound infection (SWI). Two months after the second survey only one third of the infections were correctly recorded by the hospital routine surveillance of surgical wound infections (SWI). Registration systems that are simpler and more valid than the existing ones need to be developed. A follow-up was carried out with self-administered questionnaires in 2976 patients, of whom 1447 (48.6%) responded. A patient-diagnosed SWI was defined as an antibiotic treatment of a wound and/or a wound reopening by a health care professional. A total of 311 patients were treated for a SWI, 42% with antibiotics, 27% with wound reopening and 31% received both these treatments.  Post-discharge surveillance cannot be recommended as a routine.

TI  - H+ secretion is inhibited by clostridial toxins in an inner medullary collecting duct cell line.  
AB  - Renal epithelial cell H+ secretion is an exocytic-endocytic phenomenon. In the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cell line, which we have utilized as a model of renal epithelial cell acid secretion, we found previously that acidification increased exocytosis and alkalinization increased endocytosis. It is likely, therefore, that the rate of proton secretion is regulated by the membrane insertion and retrieval of proton pumps. There is abundant evidence from studies in the nerve terminal and the chromaffin cell that vesicle docking, membrane fusion, and discharge of vesicular contents (exocytosis) involve a series of interactions among so-called trafficking proteins. The clostridial toxins, botulinum and tetanus are proteases that specifically inactivate some of these proteins. In these experiments we demonstrated, by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation, the presence in this IMCD cell line of the specific protein targets of these toxins, synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP), syntaxin, and synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25). Furthermore, we showed that these toxins markedly inhibit the capacity of these cells to realkalinize after an acid load. Thus these data provide new insight into the mechanism for H+ secretion in the IMCD.

TI  - Diagnostic value of 123iodine scintigraphy and perchlorate discharge test in the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism.  
AB  - AIM: Forty children suffering from congenital primary permanent hypothyroidism were studied to determine the diagnostic impact of 123I scintigraphy in comparison to laboratory findings and ultrasonography. METHODS: In all patients 123I scintigraphy was performed after intravenous administration of 3.7 MBq 123I. If accumulation of the radiotracer in thyroid tissue occurred a perchlorate discharge test was performed subsequently. RESULTS: Scintigraphy revealed athyrosis in 7 children. In 11 children a lingual thyroid was observed. Deficiency in iodine organification was diagnosed by a significant discharge of 123I in 15 patients. In four of these children the diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome could be established. Ectopic thyroid tissue could be demonstrated only by scintigraphy where clinical examination and sonography failed in the diagnosis in all cases. Hypoplasia of the thyroid gland as it was diagnosed in 2 cases by ultrasonography appeared to be unlikely because a normal 123I uptake was seen in these patients. In 2 patients with scintigraphic proven athyrosis an orthotopic gland had been considered by ultrasound. In 50% of our patients the final diagnosis could only be established if 123I scintigraphy and perchlorate discharge test were performed. CONCLUSION: This findings suggest that scintigraphy is indispensible in the correct diagnostic work up of congenital hypothyroidism.

TI  - Postinhibitory rebound during locomotor-like activity in neonatal rat motoneurons in vitro.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish how a membrane property contributes to the neuronal discharge during ongoing behavior. We therefore studied the role of the postinhibitory rebound (PIR) in the bursting discharge of lumbar motoneurons intracellularly recorded in newborn rat in vitro brain stem/spinal cord preparation. The PIR is a transient depolarization that occurs after a hyperpolarization. We first investigated how it was expressed during experimentally induced hyperpolarizations. Its amplitude increased with the inhibition and was voltage dependent. The Ca2+ channel blockers Mn2+ and Co2+ partly suppressed the PIR in a few of the motoneurons tested. When hyperpolarized, the motoneurons exhibited a sag that was associated with the PIR. Adding caesium to the bath abolished both sag and rebound, which suggested that the PIR in the lumbar motoneurons was mainly due to the activation of the inward rectifying current IQ. In the second part, we studied the physiological involvement of PIR during fictive locomotion induced by bath application of N-methyl-D-L-aspartate and serotonin. We established that experimentally induced PIR could initiate or modulate the bursting discharge of motoneurons during fictive locomotion. We then studied whether the firing patterns of the motoneurons were correlated in one way with the synaptic inhibition. When the monosynaptic inhibitory input to the motoneurons was abolished with the glycinergic blocker strychnine, these neurons stopped discharging (although they still were depolarized rhythmically). The firing of action potentials was restored by applying negative current pulses. This study provides evidence as to how one membrane property in mammals is involved in a complex type of behavior, namely locomotion.

Ninety-nine patient-relative pairs were studied. Reliability was quantified by using measures of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and correlation coefficients) and reliability coefficients. Relatives' responses met the required standards of reliability and validity, but reliability was consistently weaker in the mental health dimension. Relatives' and patients' scores differed significantly in six dimensions at discharge; however, agreement between patients' and relatives' responses, as measured by the Kappa statistic, was fair, improved over 6 months, and was greatest in aspects concerning physical health. We conclude that relatives are able to give a good proxy assessment of functional aspects of quality of life.

TI  - Neuronal activity in posterior parietal area 7a during the delay periods of a spatial memory task.  
AB  - 1. Neuronal activity was recorded from area 7a of monkeys performing a delayed match-to-sample task requiring release of a behavioral key when a visual stimulus appeared at a remembered spatial location. 2. Activity in the delay periods was significantly elevated in 28% of 405 neurons studied and could be classified as either sustained or anticipatory in nature. 3. Sustained activity was characterized by maintained or slowly decreasing discharge rates that were typically greater when the preceding stimulus was at a location that evoked a strong response. Sustained activity was terminated when a subsequent stimulus appeared at another location. 4. Anticipatory activity was characterized by accelerating discharge rates that were ordinarily greater after a stimulus at a location that evoked a weak response. Anticipatory activity was often associated with facilitated responses to the next stimulus. 5. These data demonstrate that a population of neurons in area 7a is active during the delay periods of a spatial memory task that does not require a behavioral response directed toward the location of the stimulus. This activity could represent a short-term memory trace for the spatial location of the preceding stimulus.

TI  - GroEL/ES chaperonins protect interferon-gamma against physicochemical stress--study of tertiary structure formation by alpha-casein quenching and ELISA.  
AB  - Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a structurally labile cytokine that rapidly denatures upon exposure to acid or heat. Here we show that both acid-denatured (pH 2) and thermally inactivated (50 degrees C) porcine IFN-gamma can be rescued with the Escherichia coli GroEL/ES chaperonin system and ATP, and reassembled into bioactive dimers. At 35 degrees C, spontaneous refolding of acid-denatured IFN-gamma was found to be dependent on the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride (0.15-0.25 M) or NaCl (0.1-0.2 M). Under non-permissive reaction conditions for regain of native structure (low-ionic-strength buffer at 35 degrees C), the yield of IFN-gamma refolded with GroEL/ES/ATP increased about 30-fold above the level of spontaneous refolding. In the absence of GroES, GroEL captured IFN-gamma in a folding-competent complex. Under these conditions, both ATP and alpha-casein induced release of IFN-gamma from GroEL but with the released protein tending to partition into sedimentable aggregates. Only in the presence of GroES, did ATP induce complete discharge of IFN-gamma from GroEL, with the released protein refolded into a conformation that is (a) immunoreactive/bio-active, (b) resistant to precipitation and (c) in a dimeric configuration. Chicken egg albumin and 90-kDa heat-shock protein were inactive in the exertion of any protective effect against physicochemical stress. The precise amount of protein refolded to the native state at different times of the folding reaction was determined by alpha-casein quenching and ELISA. The former is based on the conversion by excess alpha-casein of any population of unfolded IFN-gamma into one that escapes antibody recognition by subsequent ELISA. Since the native dimers, however, are not affected by alpha-casein quenching, immunoreactivity is directly proportional to the yield of correctly refolded protein. The validity of this approach was confirmed by measurement of biological activity. GroEL/ES-meditated reactivation amounted to > 80% both by ELISA and antiviral assay.

TI  - Effect of exercise rehabilitation on heart rate variability in hypertensives after myocardial infarction.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to find out whether the presence of hypertension affects heart rate variability in patients rehabilitated after myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Echocardiography, exercise testing and 24 h Holter monitoring were performed before and after 27 days of early postdischarge cardiac rehabilitation. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 64 patients aged 34-65 years (mean+/-SD 51.6+/-6.6) discharged from hospital after a first myocardial infarction who were subdivided into two groups, group A comprising 34 patients with arterial hypertension which had lasted 4.8+/-2.1 years and group B comprising 30 normotensives. MAIN OUTCOME: We expected exercise rehabilitation to affect heart rate variability, exercise tolerance and myocardial ischemia in patients after myocardial infarction with and without arterial hypertension. RESULTS: At baseline no intergroup differences were seen in the duration of exercise, workload and heart rate variability parameters. All parameters increased significantly after cardiac rehabilitation (P < 0.01): SD of all normal RR intervals 123.4+/-30.0 versus 123.8+/-30.0 ms; SD of the averages of normal RR intervals in all 5-min segments of the entire recording 115.1+/-30.5 versus 116.3+/-28.3 ms; mean of the SD of all normal RR intervals for all 5-min segments of the entire recording 49.0+/-12.5 versus 48.3+/-11.8 ms; square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals 29.7+/-9.1 versus 28.0+/-8.5 ms; percentage of differences between adjacent RR intervals > 50 ms 7.9+/-6.0 versus 7.1+/-6.1% (group A versus group B, respectively, NS). The duration of exercise and the workload were significantly increased (the rise was higher in normotensives). No differences were seen in the frequency and severity of silent myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Early stationary exercise rehabilitation after myocardial infarction improves heart rate variability parameters and exercise tolerance both in hypertensives and in normotensives.

TI  - Initial experience with the Nikkiso centrifugal pump during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Several centers use atriodistal bypass (ADB) as a protective adjunct against distal ischemia during extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Most current ADB circuits use indirect-drive centrifugal pumps. The purpose of this report is to describe our initial clinical experience with the Nikkiso pump, a more compact direct-drive centrifugal pump recently developed at Baylor, for ADB during TAAA repair. METHODS: The Nikkiso pump was used for ADB perfusion in 10 consecutive patients during graft repair of TAAAs (six Crawford extent I and four extent II). Two patients had aortic dissection. In the four patients who had extent II repairs, selective renal and visceral perfusion was also performed with the Nikkiso pump. RESULTS: No mechanical pump malfunctions or adverse events related to the device occurred. All 10 patients survived and were discharged from the hospital. No patient had paraplegia after surgery. Two patients had delayed lower extremity weakness after undergoing extent I repairs; both recovered and were ambulating at the time of discharge. No complications were associated with bleeding or cerebral, respiratory, renal, or hepatic function. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the Nikkiso centrifugal pump during TAAA repair demonstrated excellent pump function that provided sufficient flow for both distal aortic and selective organ perfusion. The prevention of permanent spinal cord injury and distal organ failure was successful in this group.

TI  - Implantation of a 16-channel functional electrical stimulation walking system.  
AB  - A 16-channel electrical stimulation system was implanted in a 39-year-old patient with T10 paraplegia to restore sit to stand, walking, and exercise functions. System implantation required two surgical sessions. In the first session, the posterior muscle set consisting of bilateral semimembranosus, adductor magnus, and gluteus maximus muscles were exposed and epimysial electrodes sutured at the point of greatest muscle contraction. Closed double helix intramuscular electrodes were implanted in the erector spinae. Two weeks later, epimysial electrodes were attached to the eight anterior muscles consisting of the tibialis anterior, sartorius, tensor fasciae latae, and vastus lateralis with all 16 electrode leads passed to the anterior abdominal wall. The electrodes were connected to two eight-channel stimulators placed in the iliac fossae, and the system was checked by activating the individual muscles. The implanted stimulators received stimulation instructions and power via a radio frequency link to an external control. Stimulation patterns for standing, walking, sitting, and exercise functions were chosen from a preprogrammed menu via a finger key pad. After 3 weeks of restricted patient activity, all electrodes stimulated either the target muscle or had an acceptable spillover pattern. The patient is undergoing a 16-week rehabilitation course of stimulated exercises gradually increasing in intensity. At the conclusion, the goal is to discharge the patient with the system for spontaneous use. Although long term followup is required to determine system reliability, preliminary clinical results indicate that targeted, repeatable, functional muscle contractions in the lower extremity can be achieved with a system consisting of epimysial electrodes.

The regimen consisted of 5-FU 1,000 mg/ m2 (day 1-5, continuous infusion) and CDDP 100 mg/m2 (day 3, 1 hr drip infusion). The interval was from the 6th to 21st day. The response to chemotherapy showed shrinking of intra-abdominal lymph-nodes and reopening of the biliary tract. The patients could be discharged from the hospital without PTBD tube and enjoyed a better quality of life (QOL). This therapy is thought to be effective against obstructive jaundice due to intra-abdominal lymph-node metastases of advanced and recurrent gastric cancer.

TI  - Incidence, acute care length of stay, and discharge to rehabilitation of traumatic amputee patients: an epidemiologic study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns of trauma-related amputations over time by age and gender of the patient and by level and type of amputation, and to explore factors affecting acute care length of stay and discharge to inpatient rehabilitation. DESIGN: Population-based hospital discharge data for Maryland from 1979 through 1993. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N = 6,069) discharged with either (1) a principal or secondary diagnosis of a trauma-related amputation to the upper or lower extremity or (2) a procedure code for a lower or upper limb amputation in combination with a principal diagnosis of an extremity injury or injury-related complication. RESULTS: Incidence of major amputations declined 3.4% (p < .05) annually from 1.88 per 100,000 in 1979 to 1.07 per 100,000 in 1993. Incidence of minor amputations declined 4.8% (p < .05) annually from 10.8 per 100,000 in 1979 to 4.7 per 100,000 in 1993. Acute care length of stay for trauma-related amputations declined 40% over the study period and was significantly affected by the patient's payer source, amputation level, and injury characteristics. Of the patients with a major amputation, 15% were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation; 60% were discharged directly home. More proximal amputation levels, presence of severe injuries to other body systems, and acute care at a designated trauma center significantly increased the likelihood of disposition to inpatient rehabilitation. The leading causes of trauma-related amputation were injuries involving machinery (40.1%), powered tools and appliances (27.8%), firearms (8.5%), and motor vehicle crashes (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a substantial decline in incidence rates of both major and minor amputations over the 15-year study period, a low rate of disposition to inpatient rehabilitation services of patients sustaining major amputations, and an apparent role of firearms as a cause of trauma-related amputations in patients younger than 25 years of age. The consequences of increasingly shorter acute care hospital stays and low rates of discharge to inpatient rehabilitation on the long-term outcomes of persons who have had traumatic amputation should be examined.

TI  - Discharge characteristics of vestibular saccade neurons in alert monkeys.  
AB  - We previously described a class of neurons, located in and around the interstitial nucleus of Cajal of the cat, that discharged during vestibular stimulation and before saccades. We called these neurons vestibular saccade neurons (VSNs). In the present study, we characterized similar neurons in the monkey. These neurons discharged before vertical saccades and during vertical vestibular stimulation as well as vertical smooth pursuit. Like cat VSNs, the discharge metrics of these VSNs were poorly related to saccade metrics and showed only occasional, weak sensitivity to eye position. They discharged most intensely (on-direction) for movements that were either upward or downward, and their on-directions were consistent during pitch and pursuit but not for eye position. For saccades, the correlation coefficient of number of spikes and vertical saccade size varied from 0.08 to 0.90 with a mean of approximately 0.6. The average sensitivity (i.e., slope) of the number of spikes and vertical saccade size linear regression was 0.3 +/- 0.2 spike/deg. Average correlations between peak discharge rate and peak saccade velocity and between burst duration and saccade duration were 0.5 and 0.4; sensitivities were 0.2 +/- 0.2 spike per s per deg/s and 0.6 +/- 0.5 ms/ms, respectively. Average vestibular sensitivities during 0.5 Hz, +/-10 degrees sinusoidal pitch while the animals suppressed their vestibular ocular reflex were 0.97 spike/s per deg/s for up VSNs and 0.66 spike/s per deg/s for down VSNs. The average static position sensitivity for the population of 39 VSNs tested was 0.55 spike/s per deg. The average gain for VSNs tested during 0.5 Hz, +/-10 degrees sinusoidal smooth pursuit tracking was 1.4 spike/s per deg/s. As we could not identify analogous neurons in the region of the monkey ponto-medullary junction, we conclude that horizontal on-direction VSNs do not exist in the monkey. We discuss a possible functional role for VSNs and similar neurons described in previous studies and conclude that these neurons are most likely involved with the process of neural integration (in a mathematical sense) of velocity-coded inputs from a variety of oculomotor subsystems and are not a pivotal element in saccade generation.

TI  - [Circadian rhythm and lacunar syndromes]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is scarce knowledge on the mode of onset of disease related to circadian rhythm in lacunar syndromes. METHODS: A prospective clinical analysis was conducted in 181 patients with lacunar infarcts (LI) and 47 patients with lacunar syndromes not due to lacunar infarcts. In every patient the onset of the disease was recorded for each of the four 6-hour equal periods of the day. The injure volume of the LI was measured by means of a computer and image analyzer. A descriptive analysis of the hour of onset of the disease and a comparative analysis of clinical differences and injure size for each day period, relating to circadian rhythm were made. RESULTS: For LI, the onset occurred during nocturnal sleep in 32.5% and during wakening hours in 67.5%. The morning onset of the disease was significantly more frequent in lacunar syndromes by cerebral hemorrhage (55.5%) than in LI (24.5%) (p < 0.001). For LI, the mean injure volume was significantly larger when associated with a morning onset (2,574 mm3), during the afternoon (1,678 mm3) or during the night (1,328 mm3) (p < 0.04).  At discharge, no significant differences were documented between hospital stay length and also between functional disability, when compared with disease onset and circadian rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: A third of patients with LI had their onset of symptoms during nocturnal sleep. The morning onset of the disease regarding circadian rhythm in LI is associated with a larger injure volume.

TI  - [Dementia syndromes and length of stay of elderly patients in internal medicine]  
AB  - Dementia is frequently observed in elderly patients admitted in Internal Medicine Units. Study of prospective data allowed comparison between 199 demented patients and 601 non demented ones, for life conditions, hospitalization parameters, way of discharge and associated diseases. Age and sex ratio are equal. Demented patients live more frequently in geriatric institutions and require more often nurse care at home. For them, social care is more frequent during hospitalization. There is no significant difference for mean duration of stay, discharge in step down unit and mortality. In both groups the predictive factors for the duration of stay are the need for social care during hospitalization and the number of comorbidities. In patients with degenerative dementia, hypertension and cardiopathies are less frequent than among other patients. These data suggest that adequate care, including social care, may produce the same duration of stay and way of discharge for demented and non demented elderly patients in Internal Medicine Units.

TI  - Factors determining angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor underutilization in heart failure in a community setting.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were underprescribed for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) treated in the community setting in the early 1990s despite convincing evidence of benefit. HYPOTHESIS: We postulated that (1) the prevalence of ACE inhibitor use has increased, and (2) prescribing biases have narrowed, as community physicians have gained additional clinical experience with these drugs for treatment of CHF. METHODS: We examined rates of ACE inhibitor use among 1,150 patients with CHF hospitalized at 10 community hospitals in 1995, evaluated determinants of ACE inhibitor prescription, and compared the results with survey data gathered among similar patients during 1992. RESULTS: Compared with 1992, ACE inhibitor use prior to hospital admission was increased among all patients (42 vs. 33%, p < 0.001) and the subset with a history of CHF (53 vs. 39%, p < 0.0005). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescription at hospital discharge also increased among all survivors (64 vs. 51%, p < 0.00005) and the subset eligible for ACE inhibitor treatment based on clinical trial criteria (77 vs. 66%, p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis suggested no change in the prescribing biases previously observed; ACE inhibitor use was related to lower ejection fraction, lower serum creatinine, documentation of left ventricular systolic function, younger patient age, prescription of any diuretic drug, and nonprescription of alternate vasodilators and calcium blockers. In multivariate analyses, physician specialty did not predict ACE inhibitor use. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use among patients with CHF is increasing but remains below the 80-90% rates of drug tolerance documented in randomized clinical trials. This discrepancy is partially explained by the prevalence of renal impairment and "diastolic" heart failure in the community setting. However, age bias, use of alternative vasodilators, and substandard quality of care may also play a role.

TI  - The influence of surveillance methods on surgical wound infection rates in a tertiary care spinal surgery service.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A 1-year prospective study of the influence of surveillance methods on the surgical wound infection rates in a tertiary care spinal surgery unit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of postdischarge surveillance, the diagnostic indications for surgery, and the type of procedure on the surgical wound infection rates. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Use of the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system for surgical wound infection resulted in infection rates above the published values for procedures performed by the Spinal Surgical Service. A preliminary review failed to find causes for these higher rates, and a study was undertaken to assess the influence of the surveillance methods used. METHODS: Patient information collected by the Spinal Surgical Service and surveillance data obtained by infection control were combined in a relational database. Surveillance after discharge was performed by regularly sending questionnaires to surgeons' offices. The diagnostic indications were assessed by dividing all patients into three groups: Class D (disc disease or spinal stenosis). Class T (spinal trauma within 60 days), and Class M (mostly complex spinal procedures for deformity and instability). Infection rates for the three diagnostic indication classes and for procedures with and without instrumentation were calculated. RESULTS: Postdischarge surveillance significantly increased the infection rates, mostly by detecting superficial infections that did not require readmission. Significant differences were noted between Class T and Class M patients undergoing lumbar posterior segmental instrumentation, despite the fact that they had a similar incidence of risk factors according to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system. The surgical wound infection rates of the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system may not be appropriate standards for specialized units with a high incidence of complex clinical problems and complicated surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge surveillance, surgical procedure classification methods, and the indications for surgery (e.g., trauma, congenital deformity) influence the surgical wound infection rate. Current adjustments for some of these factors in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system appear to be inadequate when used in a tertiary care facility.

TI  - How safe is hospital-in-the-home care? [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of negative, unexpected and adverse events associated with hospital-in-the-home (HIH) care in an established unit, and to validate indicators of safety for HIH care. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive survey. PATIENTS AND SETTING: 231 patients, who would otherwise have required hospitalisation, accepted for acute home-based care by the HIH unit at Frankston Hospital, a 350-bed hospital serving a population of 240,000 on the south-eastern boundary of Melbourne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following indicators of safety: patient telephone calls to the on-call service; unscheduled staff callout to patients' homes; return to hospital during an HIH admission; and return to hospital after discharge. RESULTS: 190 acute admissions were examined. Planned same-day admissions were uneventful and excluded from the analysis. The therapies provided were intravenous therapy (mainly antibiotics), anticoagulation, and wound care. Unplanned patient telephone calls were received in 6.3% of admissions; 5.8% of acute admissions required an unscheduled staff home attendance; 4.2% of episodes resulted in a return to hospital, of which 2.6% required continued care in hospital; 2.2% of episodes resulted in a return to hospital within 14 days of discharge for a related problem. The rate of iatrogenic adverse events was 3.5%. CONCLUSIONS: HIH care is very safe. This study may help define safety standards for HIH care so that future studies can compare them with those of traditional inpatient care.

TI  - Orientation tuning and receptive field structure in cat striate neurons during local blockade of intracortical inhibition.  
AB  - The contribution of intracortical inhibition to orientation tuning in the cat striate cortex (area 17) was studied by responses to flashing light bars of different orientations and lengths in 68 single-units before and during microiontophoretical application of bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist, A three-fold increase in the background activity (13.3 +/- 1.3 vs 4.4 +/- 0.5 imp/s) and 4.4-fold increase in the maximal discharge frequency (264.4 +/- 22.3 vs 60.6 +/- 5.3 imp/s) was found in 96.0% of the cells studied during microiontophoresis. In most units all characteristics of orientation tuning significantly changed during application of bicuculline: i) tuning width increased in 76.3% of cells from 52.7 +/- 2.8 degrees in control to 85.2 +/- 4.6 degrees, ii) tuning selectivity diminished in 63.6% of cells by a factor of 1.5, and iii) tuning quality dropped in 68.5% of cases by a factor of 2.5. The threshold ejection current of bicuculline for widening of tuning was in 2/3 of the cells in the range from +10 to +40 nA (+31.0 +/- 4.5 nA) and the maximum effect was obtained in 3/4 of units with +30(-) + 100 nA (+67.1 +/- 6.0 nA). Unmasking of additional excitatory inputs to the studied cells due to blockade of the inputs from inhibitory interneurons in considered as the main mechanism of the described bicuculline effects.

TI  - [Protein-energy malnutrition as a consequence of the hospitalization of gastroenterologic patients]  
AB  - The effects of the clinical and dietetics in patient managements on the protein-energy status of hospitalized patients were retrospectively (four yr) investigated in 243 adult (49 +/- 16 yr), male (168) and female (75) patients suffering from chronic liver diseases (42%), intestinal diseases with diarrhea (14%), digestive cancers (11%), chronic pancreatitis (10%), stomach and duodenum diseases (7%), acute pancreatitis (7%), primary protein-energy malnutrition (3%), esophagus diseases (3%), intestinal diseases with constipation 14 (2%) and chronic alcoholism (2%). The protein-energy nutritional status assessed by combinations of anthropometric and blood parameters showed 75% of protein energy malnutrition at the hospital entry mostly (4/5) in severe and moderate grades. The overall average of hospitalization was 20 +/- 15 days being the shortest (13 +/- 5,7 days) for esophagus diseases and the longest (28 +/- 21 days) for the intestinal diseases with diarrhea patients which also received mostly (42%) of the enteral and/or parenteral feedings followed by acute pacreatitis (41%) and digestive cancers (31%) patients. When compared to the entry the protein-energy malnutrition rate at the discharge decreased only 5% despite the increasing of 30% found on the protein-energy intake. The main improvement of the protein-energy nutritional status were attained to those patients showing protein-energy malnutrition milder degrees at the entry which belonged mostly to primary protein-energy malnutrition, acute pancreatitis and intestinal diseases with diarrhea diseases. The later two groups showed protein-energy nutritional status improvement only after the second week of hospitalization. The digestive cancers patients had their protein-energy nutritional status worsened throughout the hospitalization whereas it happened only in the first week for the intestinal diseases with diarrhea and chronic liver diseases patients, improving thereafter up to the discharge. The protein-energy nutritional status improvement found in few patients could be attributed to some complementary factors such as theirs mild degree of protein-energy malnutrition at entry and/or non-invasive propedeutics and/or enteral-parenteral feddings and/or longer hospitalization staying. The institutional causes for the unexpected lack of nutritional responses by the patients were probably the high demand for the few available beds which favour the hospitalization of the most severed patients and the university-teaching pressure for the high rotation of the available beds. Both often resulting in early discharging. In persisting the current physical area and attendance demand one could suggest an aggressive support early at the entry preceding and/or accompanying the more invasive propedeutical procedures.

TI  - Evaluation of simethicone for the treatment of postoperative abdominal discomfort in infants.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether abdominal discomfort is a cause for distress symptoms in infants following administration of inhalational anesthesia, and to evaluate the effectiveness of simethicone in treating this discomfort. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded study. SETTING: Large tertiary care, university-based medical center. PATIENTS: 175 ASA physical status I and II infants under 28 months of age who underwent an inhalational anesthetic for a variety of procedures that were expected to cause relatively little pain. INTERVENTIONS: Children were assessed for the presence of postoperative abdominal discomfort, and, if evident, were randomly given either simethicone or placebo in a double-blinded fashion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Abdominal discomfort was measured using the Faces Legs Activity Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Pain Scale. Scores were recorded pre-drug; at 10, 20, and 30 minutes following drug administration; and at discharge. If discomfort had not resolved within 15 minutes after the drug was given, routine analgesics or other medications were administered. Abdominal girth was measured preoperatively, on admission into the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and at discharge. 21% of infants exhibited symptoms of abdominal discomfort postoperatively. Younger infants were at greater risk for this condition. 36 infants were given either placebo or simethicone, and of these, infants who received simethicone were comfortable earlier and required fewer rescue medications compared with placebo. There were no differences in ability to tolerate oral fluids prior to discharge or in the length of stay in the PACU. CONCLUSIONS: Simethicone is a safe and inexpensive medication that may provide anesthesiologists with an effective treatment choice for suspected postoperative abdominal discomfort in infants.

TI  - Hearing loss in survivors of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and high-frequency oscillatory (HFO) therapy.  
AB  - Survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and high-frequency oscillatory (HFO) therapy during the newborn period were followed to evaluate their hearing. Eleven of the 66 ECMO survivors (16.7%) were diagnosed with significant hearing loss after being discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This rate of hearing loss is consistent with other reports of hearing loss in ECMO survivors. The majority of ECMO survivors with hearing loss developed a bilateral sloping hearing loss; the high frequencies were more impaired than the low frequencies. The hearing of nine ECMO survivors with hearing loss was assessed with auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs) in the newborn period prior to discharge from the NICU. Seven of nine ECMO survivors with hearing loss passed their newborn ABR screen. This result is consistent with the results of other researchers. Eight newborns receiving ECMO therapy had congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH). Three of these newborns (37.5%) were subsequently diagnosed as having a hearing loss. The combination of CDH and ECMO therapy may be a strong predictor of hearing loss. Six HFO survivors with hearing losses were also followed. Their losses were similar to the ECMO survivors with hearing loss, including the progressive nature of the loss (all five of these newborns with neonatal ABR screens passed them only to later be diagnosed with a hearing loss). A growing body of research indicates that newborns experiencing severe oxygen deprivation are at risk for progressive hearing loss.

TI  - [Quality assessment of the medical information on the standardized discharge summary]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: DRG-based management of public hospitals in France involves the use of standardised discharge abstracts for the "Medicalisation of Information Systems Program". METHODS: To assess the quality of the medical information in these abstracts, a sample of 649 abstracts for 1994 was collected from the Hospices Civils de Lyon's data base. To validate the information in these abstracts, we reviewed the medical records of each patient. RESULTS: The results showed an error rate of 32% (CI: 28-36) for the diagnosis-related group and an error rate of 40% (CI: 36-44) for the principal diagnosis. There was no significant difference between these error rates and the calculation of "Indices Synthetiques d'Activite" (French system for attributing points to hospital stays according to DRGs categories). CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the medical information for the "Medicalisation of Information Systems Program" remains a major challenge not only for budget allocation, but also for the study of the case-mix in hospitals.

TI  - A comparative study of calcipotriol and anthralin for chronic plaque psoriasis in a day care treatment center.  
AB  - Eighteen patients with symmetric plaque-type psoriasis were recruited for an open, controlled, bilateral half-body comparison study to evaluate the efficacy of calcipotriol/tar/UVB vs. anthralin/tar/UVB in a day care treatment setting. No patient had been on systemic antipsoriatic agents for at least 3 months prior to enrolment. One half-body was arbitrarily assigned to treatment with gradually increasing concentrations of anthralin as tolerated. The other half-body received calcipotriol ointment twice daily. Both sides received UVB and additional coal tar distillate in accordance with our standard day care regimen. Patients who were admitted to the day care program attended the clinic for UVB, anthralin, and calcipotriol on weekdays for two consecutive weeks. Anthralin was applied to psoriatic plaques on one side in the following fashion: anthralin 0.1% with salicylic acid 3% in zinc oxide paste on days 1 and 2; anthralin 0.2% with salicylic acid 3% in zinc oxide paste on days 3-5; anthralin 1% with salicylic acid 3% in hydrophilic petrolatum for 60 min on days 8-10 to thicker lesions; and anthralin 2% with salicylic acid 3% in hydrophilic petrolatum for 60 min on day 11 to thicker lesions. On the contralateral side, calcipotriol ointment 0.05 microgram/mL (Leo Pharmaceuticals, Ajax, Ontario) was applied to lesions twice daily. No anthralin or calcipotriol was applied on weekends. All patients applied coal tar oil 50% (Doak Oil Forte, Trans CanaDerm, St-Laurent, Quebec, equivalent to 5% coal tar distillate) with salicylic acid 5% in hydrophilic petrolatum to their lesions at home in the evenings and on weekends. UVB (FSX72T12 lamps, National Biologic Corporation, Twinsburg, Ohio) was administered twice daily on weekdays in increasing doses as tolerated (to erythema) prior to the application of the topical medications. No trial medications were applied to the face, scalp, or genital regions. For clinical evaluation, the standard Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) score was modified by splitting the score for area under 10%; the modified score (mPASI) for an area of coverage of 1%-4% was 0.5 and for an area of 5%-9% was 1. The head and neck area was excluded from the analysis since neither anthralin nor calcipotriol was used at these sites. Each half-body was considered to represent 100% in the area score determination. The maximum modified score for each side was 64.8 (vs. 72 in the standard PASI scoring system). Clinical evaluations were completed at days 0 (baseline), 3, 7, 10, and 42. The primary end-point was day 10. On day 10, patients were asked to compare the calcipotriol ointment to the anthralin on a five-point scale in terms of efficacy and irritancy and to state their future preferred treatment modality.  Following discharge from day care, patients were continued on outpatient UVB and tar treatments three times weekly and asked to return for a repeat clinical assessment after 4 weeks (day 42). Blood samples taken prior to treatment and at day 10 were analyzed for serum calcium. Comparisons of treatment efficacy were based on changes in the mPASI scores from onset of treatment to day 10, as well as on the corresponding percentage changes. Analyses were carried out using the Wilcoxon test. Subjective patient comparisons of effectiveness and irritancy, as well as patient preference, were tested for equiprobability using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test with an examination of the adjusted residuals.

TI  - The hypoxic response of neurones within the in vitro mammalian respiratory network.  
AB  - 1. The transverse brainstem slice preparation containing the pre-Botzinger complex (PBC) was used in mice to study developmental changes of the response of the in vitro respiratory network to hypoxia. This preparation generates at different postnatal stages (postnatal days (P) 0-22) spontaneous rhythmic activity in hypoglossal (XII) rootlets that occur in synchrony with periodic bursts of neurones in the PBC. 2. In slices from P0-4 mice, hypoxia did not significantly affect the amplitude of rhythmic synaptic drive potentials in four of five inspiratory neurones. Hypoxia reduced, but did not suppress, the amplitude of synaptic drive potentials in only one inspiratory neurone.  Spike discharge and phasic 'inspiratory' hyperpolarizations of six expiratory neurones were suppressed during hypoxia revealing a phasic 'inspiratory' depolarization. 3. The coupling between rhythmic activity in PBC neurones and XII bursts occurred under control conditions in preparations from P0-4 mice in a 1:1 manner (n = 11) and from mice older than P5 in a 3:1 manner (n = 9). During hypoxia, PBC and XII activity were linked in a 1:1 manner in all slices. 4. In six of fourteen inspiratory PBC neurones, the amplitude of synaptic drive potentials of slices from mice older than P8 was increased during the period of augmentation, reduced during the period of depression and suppressed during a hypoxic response which we refer to as central apnoea. Augmentation led to a weak-to-moderate membrane depolarization which on average was 4.8 +/- 3.7 mV. This depolarization was followed by a hyperpolarization of 6.2 +/- 4.1 mV only in four inspiratory neurones. In the majority of neurones (n = 9), however, membrane depolarization remained stable and was not followed by hyperpolarization. In expiratory neurones (n = 12) from this age group hypoxia suppressed phasic hyperpolarizations that occurred in synchrony with XII bursts. As similarly seen in inspiratory neurones, membrane potentials were depolarized by 5.1 +/- 4.1 mV during the period of hypoxic augmentation. 5. The hypoxic response of respiratory neurones within the pre-Botzinger complex resembles the response of neurones that were previously described under in vivo conditions. Thus we conclude that the 'transverse rhythmic slice' is a good model for studying the hypoxic response of the respiratory network under in vitro conditions.

TI  - [From the study of biochemical changes in ischemic and reperfused skeletal muscle to the controlled reperfusion of limbs in patients with acute severe ischemia]  
AB  - The reperfusion of a limb which has been submitted to a severe and prolonged period of ischemia may be followed by dramatic local and systemic complications. The results of several experimental studies have given insights on the biochemical and physiopathological alterations occurring in the ischemic and reperfused skeletal muscle. Therefore the technique of the controlled limb reperfusion has been developed. we present the results obtained in two patients with this technique. Two patients were admitted for a limb-threatening ischemia consecutive to embolism. After removal of the thrombi with a Fogarty's catheter and before reperfusion with the normal blood, a controlled limb reperfusion was performed by mixing the systemic blood with a crystalloid solution in order to obtain a hyperosmolar, hypocalcemic, alcalotic and substrate-enriched (aspartate and glutamate) reperfusate. This reperfusate was infused during 30 min with a roller pump into the deep and superficial femoral arteries. The delivery conditions (temperature, flow and reinjection pressure) were closely monitored. In both cases, no post-operative complication was observed and the pedal pulses were restored after the operation. Complete recovery of the motor and sensitive functions were observed and the patient were discharged at the 10th post-operative day.

AB  - This study reviews the cervical smear history of women developing CIN aged over 50 years to consider if they might be discharged sooner from the cervical screening programme in Tayside Region. From the OCCURS database all women over 50 years who developed CIN between 1 Jan 1993 and 30 June 1996 were identified and their smear history obtained. Results show that had women been discharged from the screening programme at age 50 following three consecutive negative smears and a negative exit smear then only two women with CIN 3 and one with microinvasive disease would have been missed in the subsequent three and a half years. A wider geographical survey of the incidence of CIN in this older age group is needed to determine whether it is cost beneficial and cost effective to continue cervical screening beyond the age of 50 years.

TI  - Geriatric evaluation is a useful adjunct to traditional medical care of the frail older patient.  
AB  - GEMU evaluation is most helpful in complicated cases where frail elderly patients appear likely to require custodial nursing home care in the near future. The best results and most significant reductions in subsequent mortality have occurred in less ill or more recently debilitated elders with a reasonable chance of returning to modified self-care in the home or in assisted living situations. Adapting these principles in an effective, cost-efficient manner for outpatient care is the focus of the majority of current investigations of CGA/GEM. Unfortunately, this option will not be universally available even after the proper parameters for its use are determined. Furthermore, better geriatric assessment and earlier intervention could logically prevent or forestall the patient's functional decline, dependency, and the need for placement. Toward that goal, the reader is referred to a practical guide to efficient outpatient geriatric assessment for general internists and other primary care providers, published by Dr. D.B. Reuben in 1996. A number of questionnaires and rapid screening techniques are included, which make these assessments less cumbersome and thus feasible in this era of austere Medicare reimbursement. However, when managing the care of outpatients with multiple impediments to independent living or hospitalized patients who are partially dependent upon others and are likely to require nursing home placement at (or shortly after) discharge, careful consideration should be given to referral for formal GEM, even if travel to a metropolitan area is required.

TI  - Long-term effects of sectioning the olivocochlear bundle in neonatal cats.  
AB  - The olivocochlear bundle (OCB) was cut in neonatal cats to evaluate its role in the development of normal cochlear function. Approximately 1 year after deefferentation, acute auditory nerve fiber (ANF) recordings were made from lesioned animals, lesion shams, and normal controls. The degree of deefferentation was quantified via light microscopic evaluation of the density of OCB fascicles in the tunnel of Corti, and selected cases were analyzed via electron microscopy. In the most successful cases, the deefferentation was virtually complete. ANFs from successfully lesioned animals exhibited significant pathophysiology compared with normals and with other animals in which the surgery failed to interrupt the OCB. Thresholds at the characteristic frequency (CF), the frequency at which ANFs are most sensitive, were elevated across the CF range, with maximal effects for CFs in the 10 kHz region. Frequency threshold or tuning curves displayed reduction of tip-to-tail ratios (the difference between CF and low-frequency "tail" thresholds) and decreased sharpness of tuning. These pathological changes are generally associated with outer hair cell (OHC) damage. However, light microscopic histological analysis showed minimal hair cell loss and no significant differences between normal and deefferented groups.  Spontaneous discharge rates (SRs) were lower than normal; however, those fibers with the highest SRs remained more sensitive than those with lower SRs. Findings suggest that the interaction between OC efferents and OHCs early in development may be critical for full expression of active mechanical processes.

AB  - Risk factors and outcomes associated with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetics and nondiabetics were analyzed for 376 consecutive patients, 77 with diabetes (20%) and 299 nondiabetics (80%), who had non-Q-wave MI and had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) performed before discharge from hospital during the period from January 1992 to February 1996. Diabetics were slightly older (64 +/- 10 years vs 61 +/- 12 years, p <0.053), had more prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery (27% vs 12%, p <0.001), and hypertension (77% vs 49%, p <0.001). There was no significant difference in unstable angina, saphenous vein graft PTCA, single versus multiple vessel disease, or history of MI. PTCA success rates for diabetics versus nondiabetics were similar (96% vs 97%, p = NS). In-hospital complications such CABG, recurrent MI, repeat PTCA, stroke, and death were not statistically significant between the 2 groups. At 1-year follow-up, survival in diabetics (92%) was similar to nondiabetics (94%, p = NS), although event-free survival (PTCA, CABG, MI, death) was worse in diabetics (55% vs 67% for nondiabetics, p <0.05). Although diabetic patients with non-Q-wave MI represent a cohort with more risk factors for poor outcome, aggressive in-hospital revascularization with PTCA results in an excellent short-term outcome as well as 1-year survival similar to the nondiabetic patients. However, total events at 1-year follow-up are more common in the diabetic patients, suggesting that more aggressive screening and therapy in follow-up may be warranted, and that a diabetic with non-Q-wave MI will require increased utilization of cardiovascular resources in the first year after the event.

TI  - Motor unit activity during long-lasting intermittent muscle contractions in humans.  
AB  - Changes accompanying long-lasting intermittent muscle contractions (30%-50% of the maximal) were investigated by tracing the activity of 38 motor units (MU) of the human biceps brachii muscle recorded from fine-wire branched electrodes. The motor task was a continuous repetition of ramp-and-hold cycles of isometric flexion contractions. During ramp-up phases a significant decline in recruitment thresholds was found with no changes in the discharge pattern. During ramp-down phases the unchanged mean value of derecruitment thresholds during the task was accompanied by increased duration of the last two interspike intervals (ISI). These findings would suggest that during fatigue development the main compensatory mechanism during ramp-up contractions is space coding while for ramp-down contractions it is rate coding. During the steady-state phases the mean value of ISI, as well as the firing variability. had increased by the end of the task in most of the MU investigated . In addition 17 recruited MU were also investigated. These units revealed a lower initial discharge rate and a faster decrease in the mean discharge rate with the development of fatigue. The gradual reduction of the recruitment threshold of already active MU and the recruitment of new units demonstrated an increased excitability of the motorneuron pool during fatigue. A typical recruitment pattern (a first short ISI followed by a long one) was observed during ramp-up contractions in units active from the very beginning of the task, as well as during sustained contractions at the onset of the stable discharge of the additionally recruited MU.

TI  - Tocolysis of preterm contractions does not improve preterm delivery rate or perinatal outcomes.  
AB  - To determine whether hospital admission and parenteral tocolysis of patients with threatened preterm labor results in a decreased preterm delivery rate and improved perinatal outcome, we performed a prospective cohort study comparing tocolytic treatment versus no tocolytic treatment. Women between 20 and 37 weeks' gestation who presented with at least eight uterine contractions per hour and a cervical examination <2 cm dilated, <80% effaced, and no cervical change over a 2-hr period were entered into the study. Exclusion criteria included cervical change, multiple gestation, chorioamnionitis, rupture of membranes, placenta previa or abruption, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, and prior tocolytic therapy in the current pregnancy. Seventy-five patients were admitted to the hospital for tocolysis (tocolysis cohort) and 81 were observed and discharged to home (observation cohort). There was no significant difference in mean gestational age at delivery, mean birth weight, or in preterm delivery rate between the two cohorts. Four of the eight women in the observation cohort who delivered preterm had a history of preterm delivery. We conclude that discharging women with preterm contractions without objective evidence of labor does not result in an increase in preterm births. More importantly, tocolysis did not decrease the preterm delivery rate in this cohort.

TI  - Thirteen-year follow-up of deliberate self-harm, using linked data.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe a national cohort of individuals surviving an episode of deliberate self-harm (DSH). Subsequent admissions for DSH and mortality over the following 13 years were studied. METHOD: In 1981, 8304 individuals were discharged from Scottish general hospitals with a diagnosis of attempted suicide (E950-959). They were followed-up to the end of 1994 using the Scottish Linked Data Set. Mortality was compared to the Scottish population using person-years analysis. RESULTS: 2624 people (31.6%) were readmitted with further episodes of DSH. The median number of readmissions was 1, range 1-137. The observed:expected ratio for all-cause mortality was 2.26 (95% CI 2.13-2.26). One hundred and sixty-eight people (2%) died from suicide, and 46 (0.6%) from undetermined causes. The observed:expected ratio for suicide plus undetermined deaths was 12.17 (95% CI 10.64-13.91). Accidental deaths in men and homicide deaths in men and women were elevated. The pattern of deaths from other causes suggested that alcohol misuse was a contributory factor. CONCLUSIONS: People admitted to general hospitals in Scotland after attempted suicide are at high risk of readmission for further episodes of DSH. Long-term follow-up of such large cohorts is impractical, but services should review the scope for intervention in alcohol misuse following DSH.

TI  - Persistence of the biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia in preterm infants.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize postnatal maturation of the biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia in order to determine whether it persists beyond the first weeks of life in preterm infants, and the contributions of respiratory frequency and tidal volume to this response. METHODS: Stable preterm infants were studied at two postnatal ages, 2 to 3 weeks (n = 12) and 4 to 8 weeks (n = 12), before hospital discharge at 35 weeks (range, 33 to 38 weeks) of postconceptional age. Infants were exposed to 5 minutes of 15% (or 13%) inspired oxygen; ventilation, oxygen saturation, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and heart rate were simultaneously recorded. RESULTS: Minute ventilation exhibited a characteristic biphasic response to hypoxia at both postnatal ages, regardless of the development of periodic breathing. At both ages there was a transient increase in tidal volume, which peaked at 1 minute, accompanied by a sustained decrease in respiratory frequency as a result of significant prolongation of expiratory time. CONCLUSION: The characteristic biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia persists into the second month of postnatal life in preterm infants. We speculate that this finding is consistent with the prolonged vulnerability of such infants to neonatal apnea.

TI  - Clinical experience with antagonist-induced opiate withdrawal under anaesthesia.  
AB  - AIMS: The study describes experience with antagonist-induced opiate withdrawal under anaesthesia in standard clinical conditions. DESIGN: The study was restricted to patients who had undergone failed withdrawal treatments with usual methods over the past months. No control group was used. SETTING AND PROCEDURE: The patients were selected after history-taking and examination. A multi-axial diagnosis was performed. They were then admitted to an inpatient treatment unit for addicted patients. On the second day they were put into neurological intensive care. There they were intubated, ventilated and anaesthetized with propofol for 6 hours. Shortly after induction of anaesthesia, naloxone and naltrexone were administered. A high amount of fluid was used to balance changes in water and electrolytes. After anaesthesia the patients were transferred back to the addiction ward and sedated with clonidine. The patients were then fully mobilized. On discharge 50 mg naltrexone were given daily. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight patients were treated. They were long-term opiate users. Preference was given to methadone-substituted patients who were unable to rid themselves of methadone. MEASUREMENTS: The account given is based solely on clinical observations. FINDINGS: The first 14 patients were observed in detail and it is on them that this report is based. It was found that withdrawal from codeine and methadone can be shortened to approximately 2-3 days. No patient was in a condition to go home immediately after anaesthesia. Twelve patients showed significant symptoms on the day following anaesthesia. The majority of patients treated by this method will continue to suffer withdrawal symptoms for a few days after detoxification, after which time most can be treated in an outpatient setting. Dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, the lungs, the kidneys or other organs was not observed. Taking into account all the 88 patients, five had to stay in hospital for a longer period (up to 2 weeks) because of a prolonged withdrawal syndrome.

TI  - Conservation of resources: indications for intensive care monitoring after upper airway surgery on patients with obstructive sleep apnea.  
AB  - Although significant complications can result after upper airway surgery for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there is a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate level of monitoring in the perioperative period. A retrospective analysis was performed on the operative records of 109 adult patients who underwent 125 surgical procedures from January 1, 1991, to May 31, 1996, with particular emphasis on complications that would have mandated intensive care monitoring and management. Airway complications occurred in one patient (0.8%), who became obstructed immediately after surgery; he responded to naloxone and suctioning. Five other patients (4%) suffered oxygen desaturation to levels below 90% (none fell below 80%, and in only one case was it below the lowest preoperative oxygen saturation level). Cardiac complications, primarily significant hypertension, were the most common adverse events. Four (3.2%) bleeding complications were encountered; all occurred after discharge from the hospital. Routine postoperative intensive care monitoring for all adult patients undergoing upper airway surgery for OSA is unnecessary. Although high-risk patients cannot always be identified preoperatively, significant complications generally emerge within 2 hours after surgery. Therefore a decision regarding the level of postoperative monitoring needed may be made with confidence during the period of time that the patient is in the recovery room.

TI  - Conversion of complex neonatal Ebstein's anomaly into functional tricuspid or pulmonary atresia.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ebstein's anomaly, due to failure of delamination of one or more leaflets of the tricuspid valve (TV), is associated with varying degrees of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and dysplasia of the right ventricle (RV). Although refinement of tricuspid valvuloplasty and plication techniques have opened the way to a satisfactory outlook for the majority of older children and adults, Ebstein's anomaly presenting at neonatal age, secondary to ineffective forward flow into the pulmonary and systemic circulation, has a reported mortality rate of as high as 75%. In order to improve the dismal outcome in neonatal Ebstein's anomaly, we have strived for early univentricular palliation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Univentricular repair was performed in five neonates (median age 5 days; range 2-14 days) with Ebstein's anomaly, ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow, severe TR, absence of forward flow across the pulmonary valve, and small left ventricular (LV) area due to right-to-left bowing of the ventricular septum and ineffective LV loading (median indexed LV area 10.5 cm2/m2). In addition, two neonates had moderate pulmonary regurgitation (PR), one with additional pulmonary stenosis. In all patients, the indexed area of the combined right atrium and atrialized RV was greater than that of the combined functional RV, left atrium, and left ventricle (median 22.0 and 20.8 cm2/m2, respectively). The median preoperative systemic oxygen tension was 35 mmHg and the median pH 7.28. Repair consisted of TV closure with a pericardial patch (with the coronary sinus draining into the RV) (n = 3) or, in the presence of PR, resection of the dysplastic TV and division and oversewing of the main pulmonary artery (n = 2), as well as excision of the atrial septum, resection of redundant right atrial wall, and construction of an aortopulmonary shunt (n = 5). RESULTS: The median indexed LV area increased from 10.5 to 18.8 cm2/m2 as a result of more effective loading of the left ventricle. There was no intraoperative or late mortality. The patients were extubated at a median of 7 days postoperatively.  At discharge, the median systemic oxygen tension was 46 mmHg. In all five patients, at 6, 7, 10, 12 and 16 weeks of age, a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis has been constructed. CONCLUSIONS: In neonates with Ebstein's anomaly and ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow, rational palliation consists of the surgical creation of tricuspid atresia or, in the additional presence of PR or pulmonary stenosis, the creation of pulmonary atresia. These procedures may result in effective LV decompression and more effective volume loading of the left ventricle with increase of systemic output and improved clinical outcome.

TI  - Trace metal pollution in Hong Kong: implications for the health of Hong Kong's Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (Sousa chinensis).  
AB  - The territorial waters of Hong Kong are highly contaminated with anthropogenic pollutants, including trace metals. Hong Kong's population of Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabits an area where a high volume of sewage waste discharge and the close proximity of contaminated mud pits mean a considerable potential for trace metal contamination. Trace metal concentrations in the muscle tissue of fish caught from areas of high dolphin abundance are notable. However, in order to gauge the amount of trace metal consumed by dolphins, whole fish must be analysed. Whole fish from areas of high dolphin abundance have considerably higher trace metal loads than muscle tissue alone. Considering the consumption of prey items by dolphins, a daily intake of trace metals was estimated as As, 410-518; Cd, 34-44; Co, 4-5; Cr, 40-50; Cu, 44-56; Hg, 51-66; Mo, 22-27; Ni, 19-24; Pb, 320-403; Se, 99-125 and Zn, 388-490 (microgram kg-1 body wt. per day). Concentrations of arsenic, chromium, lead, molybdenum and nickel in dolphin tissues were an order of magnitude lower than in prey items, suggesting these elements may be excreted by this species. Mercury concentrations in dolphin tissues were, however, an order of magnitude higher than in prey items and could be considered potentially health threatening (max: 906 micrograms kg-1 dry wt.). Hong Kong's Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin population has a high dietary intake of trace metals which may, especially in the case of mercury, be a cause for concern.

AB  - Utero-ovarian arterial blood flow and hormonal profile were evaluated in 20 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in 22 patients with normal menstrual cycle (NMC) undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. In this controlled prospective clinical study the vascular impedance in the utero-ovarian arteries was measured in both groups on days 4, 13, 22 [introduction of gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) administration], 36 (after the 14 day GnRHa administration) and on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Simultaneously, serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol, androstendione and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were determined. In the PCOS group significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations of FSH and LH were found on day 22, whereas the excess of androstendione production and lower SHBG values were registered throughout the studied cycles. Also, no effect of the 14 day GnRHa administration on the androstendione discharge was registered. In both groups the serum LH concentration decreased significantly (P < 0.05); however, the value remained significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the PCOS group. In the PCOS group no changes regarding the vascular impedance in the uterine artery were registered in the phase of the cycle preceding the GnRHa administration. The resistance index (RI) on day 22 of the cycle was 0.86 in the PCOS and 0.82 in the NMC group. In the NMC group the active ovary showed dramatic changes during the cycle, with vascular impedance almost constant throughout the cycle in the inactive ovary. In the PCOS group the vascular impedance to ovarian arterial blood flow in both ovaries was similar to that in inactive ovaries in the NMC group. After the 14 day GnRHa administration the utero-ovarian vascular impedance was high in both groups with changes registered only in the NMC group, as the PCOS patients exhibited maximal vascular impedance throughout the cycle. On the day of HCG administration strong negative correlation between the vascular impedance in the uterine artery and the serum oestradiol concentration in stimulated cycles was found in both groups, but not in anovulatory PCOS patients. As in PCOS patients the utero-ovarian vascular impedance was raised throughout the cycle we concluded that the 14 day GnRHa administration neither affected the utero-ovarian arterial blood flow nor suppressed the androstendione discharge.

TI  - Postnatal changes in responses of rat dorsal horn cells to afferent stimulation: a fibre-induced sensitization.  
AB  - 1. In vivo extracellular recordings were made of 171 dorsal horn cells in both superficial and deep laminae in urethane-anaesthetized newborn rats aged 3, 6, 10 and 21 days, and their response to single and repeated stimuli to primary afferent fibres investigated. 2. No long-latency spike responses were evoked in response to C fibre stimulation in pups at postnatal day 3 (P3) or P6, while by P10, 35 % of cells had a C fibre response. Latencies of response to A fibre skin stimulation were very long and varied widely in the youngest animals, particularly in superficial cells, but mean latencies decreased with postnatal age, from 33.1 +/- 2.78 ms at P3 to 7.3 +/- 0.3 ms at P21. The mean number of spikes evoked by a single A fibre skin stimulus was remarkably consistent between cells and not significantly different in superficial and deep laminae at each age. The mean value of 5.1 +/- 0.6 at P3 increased to 7.0 +/- 1.4 at P10. 3. Repeated stimulation of cutaneous A fibres at 0.5 Hz at twice the threshold level did not significantly alter the magnitude of the evoked response but led to shifts in latency, or 'latency jitter', which decreased with age. Deeper cells displayed more latency jitter than superficial cells. 4. Repeated stimulation of cutaneous A fibres at 0.5 Hz at twice the threshold level produced considerable sensitization in a population of dorsal horn cells in the neonate. This sensitization was unlike the classic C fibre-evoked 'wind-up' observed in adult dorsal horn. The direct A fibre-evoked activity did not increase, but the background activity increased during repetitive stimulation leading to a prolonged after-discharge beyond the stimulation period. At P6, 33 % of cells were sensitized, displaying a mean after-discharge of 70.6 +/- 18 s. At P10, only 6 % were sensitized, with a mean after-discharge of 63 s, and by P21, sensitization was no longer observed. 5. The present study demonstrates that the postsynaptic activity evoked in neonatal dorsal horn cells by cutaneous afferents differs considerably from that in adults. The results may account for the known behavioural reflex sensitization to low-intensity cutaneous stimulation observed in neonatal rats and man.

TI  - Discharge destination and motor function outcome in severe stroke as measured by the functional independence measure/function-related group classification system [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Function-related groups based on the Functional Independence Measure have been proposed as a model for a prospective payment system for medical rehabilitation. This study describes discharge destination and motor function outcomes in a sample of patients with stroke from the FIM-FRG STR1 classification. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 293 cases of stroke from the years 1993 to 1995. The demographic and outcome characteristics of this sample were described. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Forty-five percent of the patients were discharged to home after a mean length of stay of 23.8 days in acute medical rehabilitation. Patients who were discharged home had higher admission and discharge motor FIM scores than those discharged to a subacute facility or long-term care facility, although the correlation between motor FIM score and discharge destination was low to moderate. Median discharge motor FIM scores indicate considerable residual disability in this classification after rehabilitation. Research problems that address methods to improve the usefulness of the FIM-FRG system in a prospective payment system are discussed.

TI  - Work status and attrition from longitudinal studies are influenced by psychiatric disorder.  
AB  - Participants (n=95) were assessed at the time of discharge and at 4 and 12 months after discharge in regard to work status and psychiatric history both before and after the burn injury. Complex psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse disorders that occurred before the burn injury each significantly raised the risk of unemployment before the burn injury; preburn substance abuse also affected unemployment at 4 months after the burn injury. Trends for higher unemployment rates at 12 months after discharge also were noted among those with a preburn history of complex psychiatric comorbidity and alcohol use, anxiety, or mood disorder. Preburn substance-use disorder raised the risk of attrition from the 12-month study; whereas, those diagnosed at the time of discharge with post-traumatic stress disorder or with two or more current psychiatric disorders after the burn injury dropped out less often. The greater risk for unemployment and attrition observed among subjects with psychiatric disorders before the burn injury suggests the need for routine screening, tracking, and assistance in accessing supportive or rehabilitative services to remove barriers to employment.

TI  - Preadmission psychosocial screening of older orthopedic surgery patients: evaluation of a Social Work Service.  
AB  - A preadmission social work intervention was evaluated for impact on length of hospital stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction. Psychosocial issues related to function and post-discharge needs were assessed at an exploratory level. A modified post-test only control group design was used. Study group patients were screened before hospitalization and offered services on admission. Control group patients received standard care. Study group patients were significantly more satisfied with services but impact on length of stay was not demonstrated with one possible exception. Post-operative complications were significantly related to longer LOS; however, unlike control group patients, study group patients with complications did not have significantly longer LOS. Women and those limited in preadmission physical function were most likely to report insufficient help after discharge. A more intensive preadmission intervention is recommended to improve impact on LOS and informal support system involvement, while future outcome studies would clarify the nature of service gaps and high risk groups.

AB  - This article examines the extent to which the costs of formal health care are shifted from third-party payers to the patient and his or her family, especially during the transition to the community after discharge from a state hospital. Findings indicate that patients residing in the community are as likely to receive some care as their counterparts in institutions, but are at higher risk for uncovered care. Uncovered care is more likely to manifest as an unmet need for patients who have been recently discharged, especially for racial minorities, and as an out-of-pocket expense for patients who are established in the community.

TI  - Postoperative pain control after microlaparoscopy in patients with infertility: a prospective randomized study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intraperitoneal subdiaphragmatic instillation of lidocaine and trocar site infiltration of bupivacaine to minimize postoperative pain after diagnostic microlaparoscopy performed under local anesthesia with conscious sedation. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Day-surgery unit of Endogyn Service, Naples, and Department of Gynecologic and Pediatric Sciences, Reggio Calabria University, Catanzaro, Italy. PATIENT(S): Sixty-one women with infertility. INTERVENTION(S): All patients received local anesthesia and conscious sedation before surgery. After the microlaparoscopy, the treatment group was given 40 mL of intraperitoneal subdiaphragmatic 0.5% lidocaine and 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine that was infiltrated into the trocar insertion sites. The control group received no treatment. When necessary, ketoprofene or ketorolac were administered IM after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Postoperative pain was evaluated with the use of a visual analog scale with scores ranging from 1-10 immediately after surgery and over the next 48 hours. The rate at which patients were discharged from the hospital 2 hours after surgery also was recorded. RESULT(S): The treatment group had significantly lower pain scores both immediately after surgery and 1, 3, and 6 hours afterward. The need for postoperative analgesics also was significantly lower in the treatment group. The rate at which patients were discharged 2 hours after surgery was significantly higher in the treatment group. CONCLUSION(S): Postoperative intraperitoneal lidocaine administration and bupivacaine infiltration of the trocar sites is beneficial for patients undergoing microlaparoscopy. The effect of these drugs is temporary, but they can significantly decrease postoperative pain for approximately 6 hours and reduce the need for additional analgesics. Most important, the rate at which patients can be discharged from the hospital only 2 hours after surgery is increased significantly.

TI  - Primate red nucleus discharge encodes the dynamics of limb muscle activity.  
AB  - We studied the dynamical relationship between magnocellular red nucleus (RNm) discharge and electromyographic (EMG) activity of 10-15 limb muscles in two monkeys during voluntary limb movement. Recordings were made from 158 neurons during two different kinds of limb movement tasks. One was a tracking task in which the subjects were required to acquire targets displayed on an oscilloscope by rotating one of six different single degree of freedom manipulanda. During this task, we recorded the angular position of the manipulandum. The monkeys also were trained in several free-form food-retrieval tasks that were much less constrained mechanically. There was generally significantly greater neuronal discharge during the free-form tasks than during the tracking task. During both types of tasks, cross-correlation and impulse response functions calculated between RNm and EMG were predominantly pulse-shaped, indicating that the dynamics of the RNm discharge were very similar to those of the muscle activity. There was no evidence during either task for a substantial dynamical transformation (e.g., integration) between the two signals as had been previously suggested. In only 15% of the cases, did these correlations have step or pulse-step dynamics. There was a relatively broad, unimodal distribution of lag times between RNm and EMG, based on the time of occurrence of the peak correlation. During tracking, the mode of this distribution was approximately 50 ms, with 80% of the lags falling between -100 and 200 ms. During the free-form task, the mode was between 0 and 20 ms, with 65% of the lags between -100 and 200 ms. A positive lag indicates that RNm discharge preceded EMG. The shape and timing of both the cross-correlation and the impulse response functions were consistent with a model in which many RNm neurons contribute mutually correlated signals which are simply summed within the spinal cord to produce a muscle activation signal.

In the present study, morning bright light as well as evening melatonin phase-advanced sleep-wake cycles and melatonin rhythm. Both these procedures achieved appropriate entrainment to a 24 h day. However, the patient did not continue morning bright light therapy after the discharge. Rising at appropriate times in the morning for bright light therapy was difficult for him to continue. Melatonin treatment was better tolerated because of its ease of application.

TI  - Outcome of intensive care patients in a group of British intensive care units [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify priorities for intensive care unit (ICU) intervention and research. DESIGN: Analysis of a large intensive care database. SETTING: Twenty-four ICUs in the North Thames region of the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to an ICU between January 1, 1992, and April 31, 1996, on whom data had been entered into the database. Patients who were admitted after cardiac surgery, who had burns, or were <16 yrs of age were excluded from the study, as were data from patients with a previous ICU admission within 6 mos or where ICU or hospital outcome was unknown. Data were excluded from units that had entered <300 patients into the database. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 23,331 admissions with complete records were available. After exclusions, 12,762 admissions from 15 ICUs were selected for analysis. Hospital mortality was 32.5% with a mortality ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.17). Nonsurvivors were older than survivors and had longer ICU stays. Patients admitted from wards had a higher mortality than patients from the operating room/recovery or the emergency department. Observed percentage mortality increased linearly with mortality predicted by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, although the number of patients who died remained broadly constant across the range of predicted mortality. Twenty-seven percent of all deaths occurred after discharge from the ICU. Patients admitted after cardiopulmonary resuscitation constituted 30% of all deaths. Thirty-four percent of patients were in the ICU for >2 days, and they accounted for nearly 81% of bed days. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of patients at risk, both before admission and after discharge from the ICU, may allow treatment to decrease mortality. Research and resources may be best directed at patients who die, despite a relatively low predicted mortality. Although these patients are a small percentage of the low-risk admissions, they constitute a large number of ICU deaths. Many patients die after discharge from ICU and this mortality may be decreased by minimizing inappropriate early discharge to the ward, by the provision of high-dependency and step-down units, and by continuing advice and follow-up by the ICU team after the patient has been discharged. Intervention before ICU admission and support of patients after discharge from the ICU should be part of the effort to decrease mortality for ICU patients. Inadequate provision of resources for critically ill patients may result in excess intensive care mortality that is not detected with ICU outcome prediction methods.

TI  - Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at discharge in patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States: data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients discharged after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify clinical factors associated with ACE inhibitor prescribing patterns. BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have demonstrated a significant mortality benefit in patients treated with ACE inhibitors after AMI. Numerous studies have demonstrated underuse of other beneficial treatments for patients with AMI, such as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, aspirin and immediate reperfusion therapy. METHODS: Demographic, procedural and discharge medication data from 190,015 patients with AMI were collected at 1,470 U.S. hospitals participating in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2. RESULTS: Prescriptions for ACE inhibitor therapy at hospital discharge increased from 25.0% in 1994 to 30.7% in 1996. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =40% or evidence of congestive heart failure while in the hospital were discharged with ACE inhibitor treatment 42.6% of the time. Of patients experiencing an anterior wall myocardial infarction and no evidence of heart failure, 26.1% of patients were discharged with this treatment. Of the remaining patients, 15.6% received ACE inhibitors at discharge. ACE inhibitors were prescribed more often to elderly and diabetic patients as well as those requiring intraaortic balloon pump placement. This therapy was given less often to patients who underwent revascularization with coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery or were treated with calcium channel blocking agents. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are prescribing ACE inhibitors in patients with myocardial infarction with increasing frequency. Those patients with the greatest expected benefit receive ACE inhibitor treatment most often. However, the majority of even these high risk patients were not discharged with this life-saving therapy.

TI  - Functional recovery and timing of hospital discharge after primary total hip arthroplasty.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early discharge programmes in hospitals are encouraged to increase financial efficiency and bed availability, but standards of clinical care must not be compromised. Criteria for safe hospital discharge must be established and objective data are needed to assess how rapidly patients can achieve these discharge criteria. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 65 patients (mean age = 71 years) scheduled for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). The Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was measured pre-operatively and postoperatively at set intervals to asses recovery of function after THA. A score of 90 out of a possible 100 was used as a discharge criterion and indicated that the patient was functionally independent for safe hospital discharge. In addition, a combined score for thigh flexion and extension isokinetic peak strength was recorded for each patient before and after surgery. The number and nature of comorbidities and complications were also recorded. RESULTS: The length of hospital stay in this sample varied from 5 to 39 days. The MBI scores increased rapidly between days 3 and 5, then began to plateau from day 8 onwards. Based on the MBI, 58% of patients were fit for discharge at or before day 8. The remainder were fit for discharge from day 10 onwards (mean = 14.2 days). The latter group who required an extended hospital stay were older (P = 0.003), had more identified comorbidities (P = 0.01) and were weaker in their hip musculature prior to surgery (P = 0.001), compared to those who were discharged by day 8. A logistic regression analysis indicated that the pre-operative MBI score and hip strength score were strong predictors of timing for hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical pathway with functional milestones laid out over 8 days would be an appropriate criterion for the discharge of the majority of patients. However, approximately 40% of the patients presented in this study required a longer hospital stay before the criteria for safe discharge could be achieved. These patients can be identified pre-operatively by screening their MBI and composite hip strength scores.

TI  - Recognition of the presence and severity of newborn jaundice by parents, nurses, physicians, and icterometer.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how well parents, nurses, physicians, and an Ingram icterometer can detect the presence and the severity of jaundice in newborns. SETTING: Normal newborn nursery in a 340-bed teaching hospital. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Nurses and physicians caring for nursery infants and parents of the infants. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians and nurses examining newborns documented whether they detected jaundice in the infants and, if so, the estimated bilirubin level and the extent of cephalocaudal progression of the jaundice. An assistant taught the parents how to examine the infants for jaundice and determine its cephalocaudal progression. The assistant also obtained icterometer readings. Bilirubin testing was performed according to usual clinical practice. OUTCOME MEASURES: Nurse and physician estimates of bilirubin levels; parent, nurse, and physician assessment of the presence of jaundice and its cephalocaudal progression; icterometer readings; bilirubin levels. RESULTS: There was moderate agreement about the presence of jaundice in the infants (pairwise kappa, 0.48) However, all infants with bilirubin levels >12 mg/dL were correctly identified as jaundiced by all examiners. The parents' assessment of cephalocaudal progression and the icterometer readings were most highly correlated with serum bilirubin levels (adjusted Pearson correlations, 0.71 and 0.57, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Many parents can be taught to accurately assess cephalocaudal progression of jaundice in the hospital. The icterometer is a useful tool for assessing jaundice severity. Both parent assessment and the icterometer were more highly correlated with bilirubin levels than physician and nurse estimates in this study. Additional research is needed to determine how accurate these methods of clinical assessment are at the higher bilirubin levels that typically occur after hospital discharge.

TI  - [Extrahospital cardiac arrest: the experience of Mestre Emergency Service]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (AC) is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries. AC-related mortality can be reduced by rapid intervention. We report the experience of the emergency medical service (EMS) of Mestre on the management of out-of-hospital AC. METHODS: We analyzed 80 cases of out-of-hospital AC observed consecutively by the EMS of Mestre from February 1996 to September 1997: 72 cases (90.0%) involved cardiac etiology and 8 (10.0%) non-cardiac etiology. The 72 cases involving cardiac etiology were divided in three groups: group A) 12 unwitnessed ACs (16.7%); group B) 12 ACs witnessed by EMS personnel (16.7%); group C) 48 bystander-witnessed ACs (66.6%). RESULTS: In group A, in which 4/12 patients (33.3%) presented ventricular fibrillation (FV) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (TV) as initial rhythm, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained in one patient with FV and in one patient with asystole. In group B, 7/12 patients (58.3%) presented FV or TV as initial rhythm; in this subgroup, ROSC was obtained in 71.4% of cases (4 cases with FV and one case with TV) and discharge in 42.9%, while in the subgroup with other rhythms the rate of ROSC was 40.0% (two patients with pulseless electrical activity later died). In group C, 35/48 patients (72.9%) presented VF or TV as initial rhythm; in this subgroup, ROSC was achieved in 42.9% of cases (13 cases with FV and 2 cases with TV) and discharge in 14.3%, while in the subgroup of bystander-witnessed AC with other rhythms the rate of ROSC was extremely low (7.7%) (one patient with asystole later discharged). In group C, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed in 20/48 patients (40.1%). In these patients, FV or TV were more frequently recorded as initial rhythm (80.0 vs 67.9%; p < 0.05). In patients without bystander CPR, the interval between the time of collapse and the time of the first defibrillation was shorter in the patients who were admitted than in patients who died (6.0 +/- 1.4 vs 10.9 +/- 4.4 min; p < 0.05). Considering all patients with FV or TV as initial rhythm and the interval between the collapse and the first defibrillation exactly recorded, the percentage of ROSC decreased when the interval between the collapse and the first defibrillation increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that early defibrillation is the key factor in the prognosis of out-of-hospital AC. The data suggest that the immediate delivery of bystander CPR could extend the interval in which defibrillation is effective.

TI  - Respiratory depression produced by intravenously administered NBQX.  
AB  - To determine whether blockade of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) excitatory amino acid receptors affects breathing, we administered the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX), to anesthetized cats while monitoring phrenic nerve discharge, blood pressure and heart rate. NBQX, 3 and 10 mg/kg, i.v., reduced phrenic amplitude 59 +/- 20% (n = 3) and 88 +/- 6% (n = 5), respectively, and decreased respiratory rate. Phrenic activity was completely silenced in 3 animals. These effects were accompanied by decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Our data indicate that NBQX, a competitive antagonist of non-NMDA receptors, is a powerful depressant of cardiorespiratory activity.

TI  - Comparison of 6- and 7-day physical therapy coverage on length of stay and discharge outcome for individuals with total hip and knee arthroplasty.  
AB  - Providing physical therapy service on Sundays is a much debated topic among hospital administrators. The purpose of this study was to determine if 7 days per week of physical therapy coverage results in shorter lengths of stay and differing discharge status than 6 days per week. A total of 140 subjects with hip or knee arthroplasty participated; there were 80 in the 6-day groups and 60 in the 7-day groups. Data on postoperative length of stay, discharge destination, and discharge disposition were collected by retrospective medical record review. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for differences in length of stay data, and the chi-squared test was used to test for differences in discharge disposition and discharge destination. No significant differences in postoperative length of stay, discharge destination, nor discharge disposition existed between the 6- and 7-day physical therapy coverage hip or knee arthroplasty groups. However, the power of the statistical tests applied was low. This study provides no evidence that 7-day per week physical therapy results in shortened postoperative length of stay, differing discharge destination, nor differing discharge disposition for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.

TI  - Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder: an open study of 40 cases treated by joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection and immediate physical therapy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy of joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection then by high-intensity physical therapy and use of an abduction splint in an open study of 40 patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. METHODS: Patients were evaluated on D0, D5 (i.e., before discharge) and D30 for pain severity assessed using a four-point scale (0-3) and for passive ranges of abduction, internal rotation and external rotation of the shoulder. RESULTS: Mean pain severity improved significantly from 2.18 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) on D0 to 1.74 +/- 0.5 on D5 (P: 0.01) and 0.92 +/- 0.5 on D30 (P: 0.02). Passive range of abduction increased significantly from 44.8 degrees +/- 1.54 degrees on D0 to 68 degrees +/- 15 degrees on D5 (P: 0.05), whereas the difference between D5 and D30 (71 degrees +/- 13 degrees) was not significant (P: 0.8). Similarly, passive range of external rotation increased significantly from 4.3 degrees +/- 0.6 degree on D0 to 13.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degree on D5 (P = 0.04) and showed a nonsignificant increase from D5 to D30 (17 degrees +/- 13 degrees, P: 0.2). CONCLUSION: Joint distention during arthrography followed by an intraarticular corticosteroid injection then by high-intensity physical therapy significantly improved pain and passive range of motion within the first five days, and these gains were sustained after one month.

TI  - Thyroid scintigraphy in children with hypothyroidism: a five-year experience.  
AB  - The presence or absence of thyroid glandular tissue demonstrated by thyroid scintigraphy is important for genetic and prognostic counseling and for acceleration of diagnosis in other affected siblings. Technetium-99m-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy was performed on 27 children with cretinism at the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital during the 5-year period from June 1991. Based on scintigraphic findings, three main groups of thyroid localization were seen. Thirteen (48.1%) were athyrotic while 3 (11.1%) had an ectopic thyroid and 11 (40.8%) had gland in normal position.  Perchlorate discharge test was performed in 8 children of the last group and the results were positive indicating an organification defect. Thyroid scintigraphy and perchlorate discharge test provided the useful information for diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis in children with cretinism.

TI  - [Evaluation of long-term prognosis in patients with heart failure: is cardiac imaging with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine useful?]  
AB  - The effect of cardiac sympathetic activity on long-term prognosis in patients with heart failure was evaluated by cardiac imaging with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) in 46 patients admitted for the first episode of heart failure (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: 18, ischemic heart disease: 10, hypertensive heart disease: 7, valvular heart disease: 4, others: 7). Cardiac imaging was performed with 123I-MIBG and thallium-201 (201Tl) at rest on separate days before discharge. Using whole body imaging, the ratio of cardiac uptake of the isotope to total injected dose was calculated (percentage uptake). The cardiac uptake ratio of 123I-MIBG (percentage uptake of 123I-MIBG divided by percentage uptake of 201Tl) and percentage washout of 123I-MIBG from the heart over 3 hours were calculated as scintigraphic parameters. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death or deterioration of heart failure requiring readmission. Scintigraphic parameters, clinical parameters, left ventricular function obtained by echocardiography and neurohumoral parameters were compared between the event group and event-free group. During the follow-up period of 26.9 +/- 13.9 (7.1-53.8 months), cardiac events developed in 14 patients (cardiac death in 10 and deterioration of heart failure in 4; 30%). Univariate analysis showed uptake ratio and washout rate of 123I-MIBG, percentage uptake of 201Tl, New York Heart Association class at discharge, fractional shortening of the left ventricle, serum norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide levels differed significantly between the two groups. Cox proportional-hazard analysis showed that the uptake ratio was an independent predictor of cardiac events (p < 0.0001). When a cut-off point in the uptake ratio equal to or less than 0.50 and age equal to or more than 65 years old were included in the Cox proportional-hazard analysis instead of actual numbers, relative risks of cardiac events by each index were 31.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 247.6; p = 0.001) and 4.2 (p = 0.025), respectively. These data suggest that cardiac uptake of 123I-MIBG is a strong and independent predictor of long-term prognosis in patients with heart failure.

TI  - Dependence and perceived difficulty in daily activities in community-living stroke survivors 2 years after stroke: a study of instrumental structures.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a need for better understanding of the structure of instruments for functional outcome assessment after discharge from rehabilitation. One purpose of the study was to contribute to the analysis of instrumental dimensionality. Another purpose was to compare disability in stroke patients within the younger age range 2 years after onset of stroke with that at discharge with respect to both dependence and patients' perceived difficulty and to extend the assessments with instrumental activities. METHODS: We studied 68 stroke survivors aged 18 to 71 years at onset (59% aged <55 years) by means of interviews in their home, using activities from the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Instrumental Activity Measure (IAM) for ratings of dependence and perceived difficulty. Rasch analysis was used to construct calibrated linear measures and to evaluate the level of fit. RESULTS: Acceptable models for comparison of dependence between discharge and follow-up were found for the physical and the social-cognitive items in FIM. However, personal care and social-cognitive items showed an increased level of dependence at follow-up compared with at discharge. A combination of physical activities from FIM and IAM also gave acceptable models for both dependence and perceived difficulty, and the hierarchical orders of activities are presented. In general, there was agreement between the ratings of dependence and perceived difficulty, but with some discrepancies. Men found it harder to be independent in such instrumental activities as cooking and cleaning than women; the opposite was true for small-scale shopping and locomotion outdoors. Subjects aged > or =55 years had slightly higher level of dependence and perceived difficulty in IAM activities than those below that age. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the hierarchical order of activities should be taken into account in follow-up studies. Differences in the environment between hospital and home, as well as differences in support and motivation, might explain the relatively larger degree of dependence at follow-up compared with at discharge and indicate the need for further rehabilitation efforts. Instrumental activities could be combined with FIM activities in a model. For individual items, ratings of both dependence and perceived difficulty may provide further insight into the disablement process.

TI  - Interest in alternative birth settings in Finland.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the extent of wishes for and realised choices of alternative and conventional birth care in Finland based on survey and registry data. METHODS: A population-based national survey to 3000 women of reproductive age and 400 men aged 18-24 and 40-44 in Finland and a cross-sectional analysis of all childbirths in 1990 1995 based on the National Medical Birth Registry (n=390, 943). RESULTS: In the survey 69% of women and 66% of men chose conventional hospital birth as their preferred alternative. An early discharge birth was chosen by 14% of women and 18% of men and home birth by 6% of women and 3% of men. Childless respondents were more likely than parents to choose an alternative other than conventional hospital birth, yet 16% of mothers and 14% of fathers would choose either home birth or early discharge from hospital in a future birth. The expressed interest in alternatives to conventional hospital care was far greater than what occurs in reality: in the MBR data 99% of births were conventional hospital births, 0.01% were planned homebirths and 0.9 % early discharge births. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a discrepancy between expressed interests and actually realised choices of birth settings. The majority of female and male survey respondents would choose conventional hospital care for birth. However, the fact that even some women who had earlier birth experience preferred some form of alternative to the conventional hospital birth should be taken as a sign of women wanting choices in birth care.

TI  - Hip fracture incidence and mortality in an English Region: a study using routine National Health Service data.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the validity of routine hospital and mortality hip fracture data in one English Region and estimated trends in hip fracture between 1978-1981 and 1993-1995. METHODS: We identified from Hospital Episode System (HES) data for 1993-1995 all hip fracture episodes relating to individual patients aged over 65 years resident in Wessex. We determined from the discharge method code whether an individual had died during that admission. The number of individual regional and district admissions and deaths were compared with those presented in the Public Health Common Data Set. We compared regional admission rates with data for 1978-1981 from a previous study. RESULTS: National comparative indicators for hip fracture overestimated individual admissions in Wessex by 17 per cent (in health authorities by 1-56 per cent). National comparative indicators for hip fracture mortality underestimated individual deaths in Wessex by 48 per cent. Between 1978-1981 and 1993-1995 the age-sex-standardized hip fracture rates rose from 1.90 to 2.63 per 1000 per year for men and from 5.70 to 7.70 per 1000 per year for women. Rates increased in all age groups except those aged 65-69 years. There was also a small fall in absolute mean annual numbers in this age group. The rates also fell in females aged 70-74. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to adjust routine national HES data to take account of multiple episodes within a single admission. These methods should be applied to national comparative indicators for hip fracture admission and deaths. Hip fracture rates continue to rise in those aged over 70 years. There may be a cohort effect with those born after 1925 showing stable rates which needs further investigation.

TI  - [Clinical pharmacokinetics of calcium antagonists]  
AB  - Calcium antagonists (C.A.T.S.) represent a heterogeneous group of pharmacons, being its mechanism of action the inhibition of the flow of entrance of calcium through type L depending-voltage channels of the membranes of the excitable cells. They are very liposoluble molecules which are well absorbed after oral prescription (90-100%); they show an important effect in their first step, they join the serum proteins in a high proportion, present a wide tissue distribution, they are quickly biotransformed in the liver and only a minimum proportion is discharged by urine without any modification. Most of the dihydropiridines are liposoluble showing pka values < 4, so that in a physiologic ph of 7.4, up to 95% of the molecule is found in a nonionized neuter form, passing easily the cell membranes through lipidic and hydrophilic routes and as a consequence their actions will appear and disappear rapidly. Amlodipine is a dihydropiridine with a pharmacologic profile different from other C.A.T.S. Due to its physical and chemical properties which confer basic and hydrosoluble features (pka = 8.6), with a physiologic ph, almost 95% of the pharmacon is found in an ionized condition, passing the biological membranes through the lipophylic routes, showing a high affinity for membrane phospholipids where they interact forming an ionic binding. The pharmacon accumulates at this level and from there it spreads very slowly towards its receptors in the calcium channel; this slow association speed explains why the vasodilator effects of amlodipine appear in a gradual manner reaching their maximum effect after 6-10 hours.

TI  - Linking inpatients with schizophrenia to outpatient care.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study focused on inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were scheduled to begin outpatient care with clinicians who had not previously treated them. The authors evaluated the effects of communication between the patients and their outpatient clinicians before discharge on patients' referral compliance, psychiatric symptoms, and community function at follow-up three months after discharge. METHODS: A total of 104 adult inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were scheduled to receive outpatient care from clinicians who had not previously treated them were evaluated at hospital discharge and again three months later. Comparisons were made between patients who had telephone or face-to-face contact with an outpatient clinician before hospital discharge and patients who did not have such contact. RESULTS: About half (51 percent) of the inpatient sample communicated with an outpatient clinician before leaving the hospital. Compared with patients who had no communication, those who spoke with an outpatient clinician were significantly more likely to complete the outpatient referral. After baseline scores and other covariates were controlled for, predischarge contact with an outpatient clinician was associated with a significantly lower total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score at follow-up and less self-assessed difficulty controlling symptoms. Nonsignificant trends toward improved medication compliance and a lower rate of homelessness were also found. The two patients groups did not significantly differ in the proportion who were readmitted to the hospital or who made a psychiatric emergency room visit during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Direct communication between inpatients and new outpatient clinicians may help smooth the transition to outpatient care and thereby contribute to improved control of clinical symptoms.

AB  - This prospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a selective discharge policy for patients treated with racemic epinephrine (RE) and intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone (DEX) in the emergency department (ED). Children younger than 13 years of age presenting to the ED with croup who were treated with RE and IM DEX and discharged home were enrolled in the study. Patients were discharged home if they were free of intercostal retractions and stridor at rest, following a 2 h observation period. Telephone follow up determined whether further medical attention for croup was required within 48 h of discharge from the ED. Eighty-two patients were enrolled in the study over a one year period. Six of these patients (7%) required follow up for croup within 48 h of discharge and 2 (2%) required admission. We conclude that a subset of patients with croup treated with RE and IM DEX in the ED can be safely discharged home.

AB  - We report a 74-year-old woman with parkinsonism and dementia, who died 4 years after the onset of the disease. She was well until 70 years of the age (1993) when she noted slowness in the movement in her left hand. She also developed gait disturbance and the similar symptoms spread to the right upper and lower extremities. Two years after the onset, she had difficulty in walk, and was admitted to our hospital on March 9, 1995. Her daughter had the onset of hand tremor at 50 years of the age and gait disturbance at 52. Her gait improved after levodopa treatment, but her MRI revealed a liner T2-high signal lesion along the outer surface of each putamen. On admission, the patient was alert but slighted demented. Higher cerebral functions were normal. She had a masked face and small voice. Her gait was of small step without arm swing. Retropulsion was present. Rigidity was noted in the neck but not in the limbs. She was bradykinetic but tremor was absent. She was treated with levodopa/carbidopa, dops, and bromocriptine with considerable improvement and was discharged on March 30, 1995. On January 19, 1996, she developed fever and hallucination; she became more akinetic and admitted again. She showed marked dementia and stage IV parkinsonism. She was treated by supportive measures with improvement in the general condition, but she was found to have a gastric cancer for which a subtotal gastrectomy was performed on March 11, 1996. Post-operative course was uneventful, but her parkinsonism progressed to stage V. She was transferred to another hospital on May 13, 1996. In July 21, 1996, she developed dyspnea and fever and was admitted to our hospital again. She was somnolent. Rigidity was moderate to marked and she was unable to stand or walk. By supportive cares, her general condition improved and was discharged to home on November 4, 1996. She developed fever on June 13, 1997 and admitted to our service again. Her BP was 150/90 mmHg. She was alert but markedly demented. Laboratory examination revealed increases in liver enzymes (GOT 75 IU/l, GPT 101 IU/l) and renal dysfunction (BUN 68 mg/dl, creatinine 3.27 mg/dl). Subsequent hospital course was complicated by renal failure and thrombocytopenia (33,000/ml). She expired on July 1, 1997. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and a chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had diffuse Lewy body disease and her daughter striatonigral degeneration. Some participants thought both the patient and her daughter had diffuse Lewy body disease. Post-mortem examination revealed marked degeneration of the substania nigra and the locus coeruleus. The medial part of the nigra also showed marked cell loss. Lewy bodies were found in the remaining nigral and coeruleus neurons. Cortical Lewy bodies were very few and the striatum was intact. Pathologic diagnosis was Parkinson's disease. Dementia was in part attributed to the marked degeneration of the medial part of the substantia nigra.

TI  - A survey of patient education postdischarge.  
AB  - Through a telephone survey, the Discharge Call Service (DCS) was instituted with 206 patients discharged from two medical-surgical nursing units. The purposes of the survey were to (1) improve patient outcomes by assessing patient perceptions of their recuperation progress after discharge, (2) assess the patient's post discharge educational needs, (3) provide additional information concerning diagnosis, treatment, or medications requested by the patient, and (4) direct patients to the appropriate medical center or community resource as needed for further assistance or education. In general, patients believed their medical status was progressing as expected; nevertheless almost half of the patients surveyed needed additional information or specific directions concerning their self-care. Findings suggest the DCS is an effective strategy to enhance the patient's ability for self-care after discharge. The DCS is also an easily implemented and cost-effective enhancement of hospital patient education and health promotion activities.

TI  - Behavioral and environmental factors associated with acute exacerbation of asthma [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relapse rate following treatment for acute asthma is high. While previous studies have evaluated the utility of pulmonary function measurements to identify patients likely to relapse, the results are conflicting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate other correctable, risk factors that may be associated with relapse. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-three patients treated in the emergency department during 1994, including those either admitted or discharged. METHODS: Patient interviews to identify behavioral and environmental risk factors for asthma exacerbation. Telephone contact and medical record review to determine incidence of relapse. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three patients were enrolled of whom follow-up data were available for 152 (68%). Twenty-one percent of the patients relapsed within 14 days. Relapse was associated with the lack of an identifiable primary care physician and inability to obtain discharge medications. There was no relationship between relapse and the use of a spacer, hypoallergenic pillow or mattress cover, cigarette smoking, the presence of pets in the home, or weekly carpet cleaning. CONCLUSION: Even following hospitalization for acute asthma, there is a significant relapse rate. Improving patients' access to primary care physicians and to appropriate medications may decrease the relapse rate. Although a significant portion of patients have behavioral and environmental risk factors for asthma exacerbation including cigarette smoking and failure to maintain a hypoallergenic environment, these factors are not associated with short-term relapse.

TI  - Importance of preoperative liver function as a predictor of survival in patients supported with Thoratec ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation.  
AB  - Patient selection is crucial for the success of ventricular assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to identify preoperative markers for survival and end-organ recovery in patients having a ventricular assist device. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 32 severely ill patients with end-stage cardiac failure being mechanically bridged to heart transplantation with the Thoratec Ventricular Assist Device System (Thoratec Laboratories Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) in a single center between 1984 and 1995. The preoperative cardiac index averaged 1.6 L/min per square meter with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 29 mm Hg. Because of a high incidence of hepatic or renal dysfunction, or both (total bilirubin: 3.5 +/- 6.2 mg/dL; creatinine: 2.0 +/- 1.3 mg/dL), biventricular support was used in most patients (28/32). A total of 30 preoperative and 4 perioperative variables were evaluated for their association with survival and liver recovery. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (59.4%) survived to transplantation and 13 died. All 19 patients undergoing transplantation were discharged alive with a 1-year survival of 94.4%. All patients without liver recovery died of multiorgan failure. Direct and indirect bilirubin measurements were the only significant predictors for survival to discharge (P = .036, .045); all other factors failed to show significance. As direct bilirubin levels increased (normal range, 3 times normal, and >3 times normal), patient survival decreased (82 %, 56%, and 33 %, respectively). In addition, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels before insertion of the assist device were significantly associated with liver recovery during support with the device. CONCLUSION: In our patient population with ventricular assist devices, liver function is the most predictive factor of patient survival in bridging to transplantation.

TI  - Standardized clinical care pathways for major thoracic cases reduce hospital costs.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standardized clinical care pathways have been developed for postoperative management in an attempt to contain costs in an era of rising health care costs and limited resources. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of these pathways on length of stay, hospital charges, and outcome for major thoracic surgical procedures. METHODS: All anatomic lung (segmentectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy) and partial and complete esophageal resections performed from July 1991 to July 1997 were retrospectively analyzed for length of stay, hospital charges, and outcome. A prospectively developed database was used. Clinical care pathways were introduced in March 1994. Comparisons were made between the procedures performed before (group I) and after (group II) pathway implementation. Common to both pathways are early mobilization and prudent x-ray and laboratory analysis. In addition, the pathway for esophagectomies emphasizes overnight intubation with 24-hour intensive care unit care, and staged diet advancement.  The discharge goal was postoperative day 10. For lung resection the emphasis is early postoperative extubation with overnight intensive care unit management. The discharge goal was postoperative day 7. RESULTS: Group I esophagectomies (n = 56) had significantly greater hospital charges compared with group II (n = 96) ($21,977 +/- $13,555 versus $17,919 +/- $5,321; p < 0.04, in actual dollars) and ($29,097 +/- $18,586 versus $19,260 +/- $6,000; p < 0.001, in dollars adjusted for inflation) and greater length of stay (13.6 +/- 6.9 versus 9.5 +/- 2.8 days; p < 0.001). Group I lung resections (n = 185) had a significantly greater length of stay compared with group II (n = 241) (8.0 +/- 6.2 versus 6.4 +/- 3.8 days; p < 0.002); although charges trended downward ($13,113 +/- $10,711 versus $12,404 +/- $7,189; not significant) in actual dollars, charges were significantly less in dollars adjusted for inflation ($17,103 +/- $13,211 versus $13,432 +/- $8,056; p < 0.01). The most significant decreases in charges for esophagectomies were in miscellaneous charges (61% in dollars adjusted for inflation), pharmaceuticals (60%), laboratory (42%) and radiologic (39%) tests, physical therapy charges (35%), and routine charges (34%). For lung resections the greatest savings occurred for pharmaceuticals (38%), supplies (34%), miscellaneous charges (25%), and routine charges (22%). Mortality was similar (esophagectomies: I, 3.6%; II, 0%; lung resections: I, 0.5%; II, 0.8%; not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of standardized clinical pathways has resulted in a marked reduction of length of stay for all major thoracic surgical procedures. Total charges were reduced for both esophagectomies (34%) and lung resections (21%) with continued quality of outcome.

TI  - [Left ventricular rupture following mitral valvular surgery]  
AB  - During 10 years from 1979 to 1988, 99 patients underwent mitral valvular surgery in our clinic. Among 99 patients, we have experienced 3 cases of left ventricular rupture (3.0%). One of 3 patients survived after successful surgical repair. In patient 1, who underwent MVR, type I rupture occurred. The tears were immediately sutured on the beating heart. But 4 hours later, he died due to rerupture. The cause of rupture was suggested the high blood pressure following the trouble of respirator. In patient 2, who underwent OMC and AVR, type II rupture occurred. The cause of rupture was suggested to be the intimal injury of left ventricle with sucker or the excessive traction of papillary muscle. Fortunately, the bleeding was stopped after the mattress suture of tear from epicardial side under the beating heart. Subsequent rerupture did not occur and she could discharge from hospital 44 days later. In patient 3, who underwent AVR and MVR, type III rupture occurred. We restarted cardiopulmonary bypass and sutured the tears adding patch closure from the epicardial side on cardiac arrest. But she died two days later due to continuous bleeding. It is suggested that the stent of bioprosthesis injured the endocardium of left ventricle. In patient 1 and 3, we might have to repair the tear after the removal of prosthetic valve.

TI  - Impact of emergency medical helicopter service on mortality for trauma in north-east Italy. A regional prospective audit.  
AB  - The hypothesis that high level on-the-field ATLS could influence mortality in severe trauma patients was tested by means of a prospective study. During a 7 month period, data of all the victims of severe involuntary trauma (road traffic accidents, work and sport accidents) in 3 Provinces of north-east Italy were entered in a database and analysed. The whole area is covered by a single emergency service which has direct control over all the ambulances and the Emergency Helicopter Service (EMHS). The area concerned by the study has a surface of 7,300 kmq with a population of 1 million inhabitants and is served by 12 first level hospitals and 4 second level institutions (trauma centres). All the patients who were still alive at the time of arrival of the first rescuers were considered, but only severe trauma patients with ISS > 15 were enclosed into the study. All the patients were followed up to their discharge from the ICUs (end point). There were three different rescue approaches: 82 Patients (GROUP A) were rescued by EMTs with BLS training, transported to the nearest level 1 hospital for stabilisation and subsequently transferred to a trauma center; 98 Patients (GROUP B) were rescued by EMTs and directly transported to a trauma centre which was the nearest institution; 42 Patients were rescued on the scene by the EMHS team including an anaesthesiologist with 10 years experience in trauma care and directly transported to a trauma centre after full on-the-field stabilisation (GROUP C) RESULTS: 222 severe trauma patients (ISS > 15) were considered. Mean ISS was 35.1 +/- 18.2 in group A, 33.4 +/- 19.6 in group B and 36.0 +/- 17.8 in group C. 67 patients died previous to ICU discharge (31%). 31 over the 82 pts in Group A (38%) died. 23 of them died even before reaching the trauma centre. The mean time elapsed between the first emergency call and the arrival at the trauma centre was 162 min (90'-300'). Mean ICU stay for patients who survived was 15 days. In Group B 31 over 98 patients (32%) died before ICU discharge. The mean time between the emergency call and hospital admission was 27'. Mean ICU stay for patients who were discharged, was 13 days. 5 over 42 patients rescued by the EMHS (Group C) died, none of them in the pre-hospital setting. Stabilisation included tracheal intubation in 34 cases (81%) and thoracic drainage in 6 (14%). All the patients arrived at the hospital with 2 i.v. line. The average amount of infused fluids were 600 mls of colloids and 810 mls of crystalloid. 13 patients with hypotension received and average of 1000 mls of colloids and 1200 mls of crystalloid. The average time elapsed between the emergency call and the final admission to the definitive care institution was 55'. Mean ICU stay was 11 days. Mortality rate in this group was 12%, significantly lower than in group A (p < 0.005) and group B (p < 0.05).
