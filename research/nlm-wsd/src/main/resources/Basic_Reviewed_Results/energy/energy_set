TI  - Evidence for reliability, validity and usefulness of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV).  
AB  - The Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) is a brief, comprehensive measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) used extensively in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The 35-item questionnaire includes ten dimensions (health perceptions, pain, physical, role, social and cognitive functioning, mental health, energy, health distress and quality of life (QoL) and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Subscales are scored on a 0-100 scale (a higher score indicates better health) and physical and mental health summary scores can be generated. The MOS-HIV has been shown to be internally consistent, correlate with concurrent measures of health, discriminate between distinct groups, predict future outcomes and be responsive to changes over time. Limited experience suggests acceptable reliability and validity in women, injecting drug users and African-American and lower socioeconomic status patients. The MOS-HIV is available in 14 languages and has been included as a secondary outcome measure in numerous clinical trials for all stages of disease. In several studies it has detected significant differences between treatments; in some cases concordant with conventional endpoints and, in others, discordant. The interpretation of scores is facilitated by an explanation in terms meaningful to the intended audience. Research is needed to compare the MOS-HIV to other strategies for HRQoL assessment in early HIV disease.

TI  - Intratumoral delivery of boronated epidermal growth factor for neutron capture therapy of brain tumors.  
AB  - The gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is amplified or overexpressed in high-grade gliomas but is low or undetectable in normal brain. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using epidermal growth factor (EGF)-based bioconjugates as targeting agents for brain tumors. In the present study, we have investigated the potential use of boronated EGF as a delivery agent for boron neutron capture therapy, which is based on the capture reaction that occurs when 10B, a stable isotope, is irradiated with low-energy thermal neutrons. A fourth generation starburst dendrimer was boronated and linked to EGF using heterobifunctional reagents. Either wild-type or EGFR gene transduced C6 glioma cells (C6EGFR), which expressed 10(5)-10(6) receptor sites/cell, were stereotactically implanted into the right cerebral hemisphere of Fischer rats. Four weeks later, the rats received either i.v. or intratumoral (i.t.) injection of 131I-labeled boronated starburst dendrimer (BSD) or BSD-EGF. The biodistribution of 131I-BSD-EGF and 131I-BSD was studied by means of whole-body scintigraphy, autoradiography, and gamma scintillation counting. Following i.t. injection of 131I-BSD-EGF, 21.8% of the injected dose per gram tissue (% ID/g) was localized in C6EGFR tumors at 24 h and 16.3% at 48 h compared to 5 and 1.3% ID/g in C6 wild-type tumors, respectively, and 0.01 and 0.006% ID/g, respectively, for i.v. injected animals at the corresponding times. In contrast, following i.t. injection of BSD-EGF, only 0.01-0.1% ID/g was localized in the liver and spleen at 24 and 48 h compared to 5-12% ID/g following i.v. injection. Our data indicate that direct i.t. injection can selectively deliver BSD-EGF to EGFR-positive gliomas and suggest that intracerebral administration may be the most effective way for delivering EGF-based bioconjugates to EGFR-positive brain tumors.

TI  - The effect of ethanol and/or food restriction on coenzyme Q in liver in rats.  
AB  - The individual and combined effects of ethanol and lovastatin on rats and their prevention by supplemental coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was studied. The ethanol and lovastatin findings are reported elsewhere. This paper focuses on the food restriction which occurred in rats fed 35% of energy as ethanol and those control rats pair-fed to the 35% of energy as ethanol group. Six groups of rats received 35% of energy as ethanol (with or without lovastatin and/or CoQ10 treatment). One group served as a 0% ethanol ad libitum control and one 0% ethanol control group was pair-fed to the 35% ethanol group. Rats receiving 35% of energy as ethanol and their pair-fed controls consumed 83% of the energy/day consumed by the ad libitum controls. This was consistent regardless of lovastatin or CoQ10 treatment. Weight gains were 84% of control. The energy reduction was consistently associated with a substantial (48%+) increase in liver CoQ9 concentrations. Reports by others of associations between food restriction and increased longevity in rodents has focused on a decrease in oxidant damage in tissues of food restricted animals. The increase in CoQ levels in the food restricted animals would result in an increase in antioxidant protection and might explain the observed increases in longevity.

TI  - Microbial thiamin metabolism in the rumen simulating fermenter (RUSITEC): the effect of acidogenic conditions, a high sulfur level and added thiamin.  
AB  - The effects of acidogenic conditions, a high S level and the addition of thiamin on the rumen microbial metabolism of thiamin were investigated in vitro in a semi-continuous fermenter (RUSITEC), using a factorial design. Acidogenic conditions were obtained by simultaneously increasing the starch: cellulose ratio and the amount of solid substrate fed, and by decreasing the buffering capacity of the liquid phase of the fermenter. S in the form of sulfate was supplied at two levels, one corresponding to a control amount of S (2 g/kg dietary DM), the second to an excess (5 g/kg DM) which is sufficient to trigger cerebrocortical necrosis (CCN) when used in vivo. Acidogenic conditions decreased the pH of the fermenters, CH4 production and cellulose digestibility, increased the short-chain fatty acid production, but had no effect on thiamin production. The high S level enhanced the production of sulfide considerably, had no effect ont he microbial metabolism of energy and N, and decreased thiamin production (326 v. 266 nmol/d). The added thiamin was rapidly converted into phosphorylated compounds which largely decreased the apparent synthesis of this vitamin by the rumen microflora. The total thiamin flow was increased by added thiamin. In no case was thiaminase activity in the fermenter liquid phase significantly modified. The high level of S induced only a limited decrease of total thiamin flow. Consequently, it is unlikely that the investigated factors could be considered to be high risk factors for the thiamin-dependent CCN.

TI  - Protein stability; optimization of electrostatic contributions by partially neutralizing surface ionic charges.  
AB  - 'Partial Charge-Neutralization Method' is developed to study influence of the relative amount of positive and negative charges in proteins on their structural stability. A given number of either positively or negatively charged groups are neutralized in all of their possible combinations to generate a whole set of distinct species.  The Coulomb energy of each species is calculated by numerically solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for aqueous solutions. Partial neutralization of lysine residues of tuna cytochrome c in aqueous solution at neutral pH with the Debye-Huckel screening parameter kappa = 1 nm-1 reproduces qualitatively well the destabilization of acetylated cytochrome c observed in physicochemical measurements at pH 7. The stabilization of its molten globule state at pH 2 is also studied with the present method. It is shown that the electrostatic contribution to the structural stability of natural proteins can be optimized by changing the difference in number of their positive and negative charges.

TI  - Chromosomal aberrations induced in human lymphocytes by high-LET irradiation.  
AB  - High linear energy transfer (LET) particles are more efficient than sparsely ionizing radiations in inducing chromosomal aberrations, in particular complex rearrangements. We analysed R-banded chromosome rearrangements in human lymphocytes irradiated with several ions having a wide range of LET (31.3-1435 keV/micron). The frequency of chromosome breaks unrejoined or inferred from observed rearrangements, and of complex rearrangements induced by a single particle, increased with the LET up to about 100-150 keV/micron and seemed to level off for higher LET values. Additional study was focused on damage induced by oxygen ions of three different energies. Significant cell cycle delay, and multiple chromosome rearrangements and breaks were demonstrated using Giemsa and Fluorescence-plus-Giemsa stainings, coupled with chromosome painting. Damage increased with the fluence and the LET, but at the higher LET damage decreased for fluences > 10(7) particles/cm2. Cell death and G2 block might be involved in this phenomenon. Chromosome 1 painting exhibited a high frequency of breaks and complex rearrangements, which would not have been detected using a standard staining. Complex rearrangements were induced by as few as one particle per cell nucleus and may be considered as a biological fingerprint of high-LET irradiation.

TI  - Conformational analysis of six- and twelve-membered ring compounds by molecular dynamics.  
AB  - A molecular dynamics (MD)-based conformational analysis has been performed on a number of cycloalkanes in order to demonstrate the reliability and generality of MD as a tool for conformational analysis. MD simulations on cyclohexane and a series of methyl-substituted cyclohexanes were performed at temperatures between 400 and 1200 K. Depending on the simulation temperature, different types of interconversions (twist-boat-twist-boat, twist-boat-chair and chair-chair) could be observed, and the MD simulations demonstrated the expected correlation between simulation temperature and ring inversion barriers. A series of methyl-substituted 1,3-dioxanes were investigated at 1000 K, and the number of chair-chair interconversions could be quantitatively correlated to the experimentally determined ring inversion barrier. Similarly, the distribution of sampled minimum-energy conformations correlated with the energy-derived Boltzmann distribution. The macrocyclic ring system cyclododecane was subjected to an MD simulation at 1000 K and 71 different conformations could be sampled. These conformations were compared with the results of previously reported conformational analyses using stochastic search methods, and the MD method provided 19 out of the 20 most stable conformations found in the MM2 force field. Finally, the general performance of the MD method for conformational analysis is discussed.

TI  - Responses of meat-type chickens to choice feeding of diets differing in protein and energy from hatch to market weight.  
AB  - Chickens from three genetic stocks known to differ in growth potential consumed ad libitum either a single (control) diet or a choice of two diets that differed in protein and energy. Formulation of the choice diets was such that when mixed in specific proportions they provided single diets that decreased in protein and increased in energy over the experimental period. When comparisons of feeding regimens were made at a common age, body weights and feed efficiencies for all stocks were enhanced in chicks fed a single diet. When comparisons were made at a common body weight for controls, chickens fed the single diet were about 15% heavier than those given a dietary choice. For feed efficiency, however, the pattern remained for the faster growing stock whereas there was no difference between feeding regimens for the slower growing stock. Chicks provided a choice of diets had heavier abdominal fat pads and lighter breasts relative to body weight than those fed a single diet. With choice feeding, there were stock by diet interactions for dietary preferences through the first 9 d after hatch. Early on, the interactions resulted from the faster growing stocks exhibiting a greater preference for the diet higher in protein and lower in energy than the slower growing stock. By Day 5, however, the interaction occurred because stocks exhibited either no dietary preference or preferred the diet that was lower in protein and higher in energy. Regardless of genetic stock, at 9 d of age and thereafter there was a clear preference for the diet lower in protein and higher in energy than the diet higher in protein and lower in energy. These data for feed intake were consistent with behavioral observations that showed a preponderance of chicks eating from the feeder containing the diet lower in protein and higher in energy. Compared to a single diet, under choice feeding, energy utilization was negatively influenced more in the faster than slower growing stocks. Protein and sulfur amino acid utilization was not affected by feeding regimen in faster growing stocks, but was enhanced under choice feeding in the slower growing stock. Although lysine utilization was enhanced by choice feeding in all stocks, the effect was greater in the slower than in the faster growing ones. These data demonstrate that although broiler diets are formulated to enhance growth and overall feed efficiency, chicks that are provided a dietary choice of protein and energy do not eat to maximize growth or feed efficiency.

TI  - Effect of measurement error on energy-adjustment models in nutritional epidemiology.  
AB  - The use and interpretation of energy-adjustment regression models in nutritional epidemiology has been vigorously debated recently. There has been little discussion, however, regarding the effect of dietary measurement error on the performance of such models. Contrary to conventional assumptions invoked in the standard treatment of the effect of measurement error in regression analysis, reporting errors in dietary studies are usually biased, correlated with true nutrient intakes and with each other, heteroscedastic, and nonnormally distributed. Methods developed in this paper allow for this more complex error structure and are therefore more appropriate for dietary data. For practical illustration, these methods are applied to data from the Women's Health Trial Vanguard Study. The results demonstrate considerable shrinkage in the magnitude of the estimated main exposure effect in energy-adjustment models due to attenuation of the true effect and contamination from the effect of an adjusting covariate. In most cases, this shrinkage causes a sharply reduced statistical power of the corresponding significance test in comparison with measurement without error. These results emphasize the need to understand the measurement error properties of dietary instruments through validation/calibration studies and, where possible, to correct for the impact of measurement error when applying energy-adjustment models.

TI  - Dietary energy restriction does not inhibit pancreatic carcinogenesis by N-nitrosobis-2-(oxopropyl)amine in the Syrian hamster.  
AB  - Dietary energy restriction was previously shown to be effective in preventing a wide range of experimentally induced cancers. Studies were conducted to assess the influence on pancreatic carcinogenesis of dietary energy restrictions (reduced fat and carbohydrate) of 10%, 20% or 40% in comparison with control in Syrian hamsters treated with N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP). Two carcinogenesis studies were conducted. One used a single treatment with 20 mg BOP/kg body weight and followed hamsters for 102 weeks following treatment, and the other used three weekly treatments of 20 mg BOP/kg body weight and followed hamsters for 45 weeks after treatment. Hamsters were fed control or energy restricted diet beginning the week following the last BOP treatment. Pancreatic carcinomas were induced in 9-18% of the hamsters in the first experiment and in 59-66% of the animals in the second. Dietary energy restriction did not influence carcinoma incidence in either study, and in the second experiment the multiplicity of tumors was higher in the 40% energy restriction (ER) group than in control hamsters. Plasma corticosterone was suppressed by BOP treatment, particularly in the 20% and 40% ER hamsters in the second experiment, and diet or BOP treatment did not significantly alter plasma cortisol. Pancreatic protein kinase Czeta measured by Western blot was highest in the cytosol and particulate fractions of the 40% ER hamsters in the first experiment. These results indicate that dietary energy restriction is not effective in the prevention of BOP induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the Syrian hamster.

TI  - Chronic weight cycling increases oxidative DNA damage levels in mammary gland of female rats fed a high-fat diet.  
AB  - Oxidative DNA damage levels may be a marker of breast cancer risk that is modulated by diet. We examined the effects of a high-fat diet fed in varying feeding regimens on levels of 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (5-OHmU), an oxidized thymidine residue, in DNA from mammary gland of aging female rats. A total of 48 rats were randomly divided into four groups: ad libitum fed (AL), weight cycled above baseline (WC-G), weight cycled below baseline (WC-L), or energy restricted (ER) for 28 weeks. WC groups were fed repeated ad libitum/restricted amounts of the diet. At sacrifice, both WC groups had body weights similar to the ER group but higher levels of 5-OHmU (p < 0.01). 5-OHmU levels were higher in the WC groups than in the AL group, even though body weights of the WC groups were significantly lower (p < 0.001). These results indicate that a history of weight cycling, even when body weight is reduced, can have adverse effects on 5-OHmU levels in mammary gland DNA, a potential biomarker of cancer risk. Constant control of calories for the maintenance of body weight, therefore, may be more beneficial.

The parenteral and enteral diets had the same protein/lipid/carbohydrate composition. The data indicated that both routes led to positive nitrogen balance. Nitrogen equilibrium was achieved by day 3 in the TPN group and by day 5 in the enteral group. There were no significant changes in serum albumin within either group. Serum level of transferrin reached a significant increase in both groups (p = 0.003). Thyroxine-binding prealbumin rose significantly in both groups as well (p = 0.019 and 0.004 respectively). Statistically significant rises in lymphocyte counts (p = 0.003 and 0.001 respectively), in levels of C3 (p = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively), IgA (p = 0.002), IgG (p = 0.004 and 0.003 respectively) and IgM (p = 0.004) occurred in either treatment group. There was a high incidence of negative skin tests at the start of the study in the enteral group (73.3%) and the TPN group (60%). By the end of the study the incidence of negative results for this test was 40.0% and 26.6% respectively. Despite maintenance of similar glucose levels in both groups, TPN led to significantly (p = 0.000) higher serum insulin levels. The serum insulin increased almost linearly over the study period, and eventually prevented fat mobilization and lipolysis, so that free fatty acid levels had fallen significantly (p = 0.000). A significant elevation of the liver enzymes over the study period occurred in the TPN group, but not in the enterally fed patients. The present findings provide no evidence that semi-elemental diets are in any way inferior to isonitrogenous isocaloric regimes parenterally given for a short period of time.

TI  - Leptin selectively decreases visceral adiposity and enhances insulin action.  
AB  - Intraabdominal adiposity and insulin resistance are risk factors for diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, arteriosclerosis, and mortality. Leptin, a fat-derived protein encoded by the ob gene, has been postulated to be a sensor of energy storage in adipose tissue capable of mediating a feedback signal to sites involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Here, we provide evidence for specific effects of leptin on fat distribution and in vivo insulin action. Leptin (LEP) or vehicle (CON) was administered by osmotic minipumps for 8 d to pair-fed adult rats. During the 8 d of the study, body weight and total fat mass decreased similarly in LEP and in CON. However, while moderate calorie restriction (CON) resulted in similar decreases in whole body (by 20%) and visceral (by 21%) fat, leptin administration led to a specific and marked decrease (by 62%) in visceral adiposity. During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (insulin clamp), leptin markedly enhanced insulin action on both inhibition of hepatic glucose production and stimulation of glucose uptake. Finally, leptin exerted complex effects on the hepatic gene expression of key metabolic enzymes and on the intrahepatic partitioning of metabolic fluxes, which are likely to represent a defense against excessive storage of energy in adipose depots. These studies demonstrate novel actions of circulating leptin in the regulation of fat distribution, insulin action, and hepatic gene expression and suggest that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance.

TI  - Three-window transformation cross-talk correction for simultaneous dual-isotope imaging.  
AB  - We developed and tested a new transformation cross-talk correction method for simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT imaging, which uses information from three energy windows in a simultaneous 18F/99mTc cardiac phantom study. METHODS: The method combines the previously reported "three-window" technique and transformation cross-talk correction methods. In the three-window technique, the images from the third energy "scatter" window are usually multiplied by a constant factor to obtain the estimates of the cross-talk. However, such an approach neglects differences in the spatial distribution between cross-talk photons in different energy windows. The transformation method is based on the assumption that the transformations, which convert the images from one energy window into the other energy windows, are known. These transformations were found by measuring the point-spread functions in different energy windows for both isotopes in water. The transformation method takes into account the different spatial distributions of the primary and scatter cross-talk photons in the different energy windows. Here, we are assuming that the imaging system and the image transformations between different energy windows are shift-invariant and linear. Thus, the new method is described by two convolution equations applied in frequency space. In addition to the cross-talk correction, the restoration filters were also applied to the resulting corrected images. The new method was performed on the simultaneous 18F/99mTc cardiac phantom study. Three separate studies were acquired in our phantom study: two single-isotope studies and one dual-isotope study. The single-isotope images were used as references. The contrast between the left ventricle cavity and the myocardium was used in transaxial slices as a parameter to evaluate results of the dual-isotope correction method with restoration. RESULTS: The contrast improvement in the dual-isotope corrected images in both energy windows, i.e., the 99mTc primary window (140 keV) and the 18F primary window (511 keV), was significant. The corrected 511-keV, dual-isotope image had a contrast of 0.74 compared to 0.60, which was the value in the noncorrected dual-isotope image. The improvement of the contrast in the corrected, dual-isotope 511-keV image was exclusively a result of the restoration correction. The restoration-corrected, 511-keV, single-isotope 18F image had the same contrast (0.74). For the dual-isotope, 140-keV transaxial slice, first, the contrast improved from 0.78 to 0.85 after cross-talk correction, and, then, it finally reached 0.92 after additional restoration correction. The contrast in the 140-keV, single-isotope 99mTc image after restoration correction improved from 0.87 to 0.95. CONCLUSION: The three-window transformation dual-isotope correction method with restoration significantly improves the contrast between the left ventricle cavity and the myocardium of the simultaneous 18F/99mTc SPECT imaging.

TI  - A novel method of scatter correction using a single isotope for simultaneous emission and transmission data.  
AB  - Photon attenuation and scatter are the most important factors degrading the quantitative accuracy of single photon emission tomography (SPET). Simultaneous SPET and transmission tomographic (TT) scans with dual isotopes have been reported to correct attenuation and scatter. However, there is cross-contamination of different energies (scatter from emission data to transmission data and from transmission data to emission data). A method has been proposed to acquire emission (functional) and transmission (structural) data simultaneously with a single isotope scan. A 99Tcm transmission line source at the focal distance is attached to the rotating drum plate of a triple-headed gamma camera equipped with fan-beam collimators. The transmission source has the same energy spectrum as the emission source because 99Tcm is also used for SPET. The triple-headed SPET system allows the transmission and emission data to be acquired by one detector (D1), while the other two detectors (D2, D3) simultaneously acquire emission data. The transmission data can be calculated by subtracting D2 (D3) from D1 after correction for time-decay. A transmission-dependent method for scatter correction was implemented with the transmission and emission data. In principle, there is no energy cross-contamination using 99Tcm as the transmission-emission source. The results of scatter correction demonstrate a clear improvement in spatial resolution. The contrasts were increased for different sized 'hot' regions both in SPET and brain phantoms. The results indicate that the proposed method can overcome the difficulty associated with simultaneous dual-isotope acquisition. They further support the feasibility of simultaneous SPET and TT scanning using a single isotope.

TI  - Determination of dissociation constants of loop diuretics in acetonitrile-water mixtures.  
AB  - The dissociation pK values of the representative loop diuretics furosemide, bumetanide and ethacrynic acid in 10, 30, 40, 50 and 70% (w/w) acetonitrile-water mixtures at 298.15 K were determined, according to the rules and procedures endorsed by IUPAC. The variation in pK values over the whole composition range studied can be explained by tacking into account the preferential solvation of ionizable substances in acetonitrile-water mixtures. With a view to determining the pK values of the loop diuretics studied in any of the binary solvent acetonitrile-water mixtures, correlations of pK values and different bulk properties of the solvent were examined, and the linear solvation energy relationships method, LSER, has been applied. The pK values were then correlated with the pi*, alpha and beta solvatochromic parameters of acetonitrile-water mixtures. The resulting equations allowed us to calculate pK values for the loop diuretics in any acetonitrile-water mixture up to 70% (w/w) acetonitrile.

TI  - The role of phosphometabolites in cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and tumor therapy.  
AB  - A common characteristic of tumor cells is the constant overexpression of glycolytic and glutaminolytic enzymes. In tumor cells the hyperactive hexokinase and the partly inactive pyruvate kinase lead to an expansion of all phosphometabolites from glucose 6-phosphate to phosphoenolpyruvate. In addition to the glycolytic phosphometabolites, synthesis of their metabolic derivatives such as P-ribose-PP, NADH, NADPH, UTP, CTP, and UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine is also enhanced during cell proliferation. Another phosphometabolite derived from P-ribose-PP, AMP, inhibits cell proliferation. The accumulation of AMP inhibits both P-ribose-PP-synthetase and the increase in concentration of phosphometabolites derived from P-ribose-PP. In cells with low glycerol 3-phosphate and malate-aspartate shuttle capacities the inhibition of the lactate dehydrogenase by low NADH levels leads to an inhibition of glycolytic ATP production. Several tumor-therapeutic drugs reduce NAD and NADH levels, thereby inhibiting glycolytic energy production. The role of AMP, NADH, and NADPH levels in the success of chemotherapeutic treatment is discussed.

TI  - Arginine kinase expression and localization in growth cone migration.  
AB  - Migrating neuronal growth cones exert traction forces that are generated by ATP-driven F-actin/myosin interactions. Sustained generation of these forces may require an energy supply mediated by the guanidino kinases, creatine kinase and arginine kinase. We cloned and sequenced grasshopper arginine kinase and examined its expression during embryogenesis and its subcellular localization in vivo and in vitro. During the first half of embryogenesis, arginine kinase is expressed selectively in a small percentage of ectodermal cells (dorsal closure cells), in a small percentage of mesodermal cells (muscle pioneers), and throughout the developing CNS. Most of these cell types are motile, including nascent neurons, muscle pioneers, dorsal closure cells, and many CNS glia. Neuroblasts also strongly express arginine kinase; they are nonmotile but are undergoing repeated rounds of (ATP-dependent) mitosis. Arginine kinase is colocalized with F-actin in a narrow band along the leading edges of lamellipodia of migrating glia. In neurons undergoing axonogenesis, arginine kinase is concentrated in growth cones and extends to the tips of filopodia. The amount of arginine kinase varies widely between growth cones, even between different growth cones of the same neuron.  Energy for growth cone migration appears to be mobilized by (1) selective expression of arginine kinase by neurons, (2) localization of arginine kinase within growth cones, and (3) concentration of arginine kinase within specific growth cones, depending on the traction forces being generated. Mobilization of guanidino kinases may participate in the selective growth of specific growth cones.

The tolerance of CNS white matter to energy deprivation can be categorized into four stages that are correlated with specific developmental features: premyelination (P0-P4), highly tolerant to anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; early myelination (P5-P20), partially tolerant of anoxia and aglycemia but not to combined anoxia/aglycemia; late myelination (P21-P49), very low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; and mature (>P50), low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia.

TI  - Axon conduction and survival in CNS white matter during energy deprivation: a developmental study.  
AB  - We investigated the postnatal development of axon sensitivity to the withdrawal of oxygen, glucose, or the combined withdrawal of oxygen + glucose in the isolated rat optic nerve (a CNS white matter tract). Removal of either oxygen or glucose for 60 min resulted in irreversible injury in optic nerves from adult rats, assessed by loss of the evoked compound action potential (CAP). Optic nerves at ages <P10 showed no permanent loss of function. CAP sensitivity to the withdrawal of oxygen or glucose emerged during a critical period in development between postnatal days 10-20 (P10-P20). The CAP was unchanged in adult optic nerve for 45 min after the withdrawal of glucose, demonstrating the presence of a significant energy reserve. Periods of glucose withdrawal >45 min caused the selective loss of late CAP components; this was not seen with oxygen deprivation. The amplitude of the early component recovered to 94.8% of control after 60 min of glucose withdrawal, although total CAP area recovered to only 42.3%. Combined oxygen + glucose withdrawal for 60 min produced a greater degree of permanent CAP loss than 60 min of glucose or oxygen withdrawal individually in optic nerves from rats older than P4. Younger than P4 optic nerves showed no permanent loss of function from 60 min of combined oxygen + glucose withdrawal. Unexpectedly, optic nerves from P21-P49 rats recovered significantly less after all three conditions than adult opticnerves (>P50). It is probable that this period of final myelination corresponds to a time of heightened metabolic activity in white matter. The tolerance of CNS white matter to energy deprivation can be categorized into four stages that are correlated with specific developmental features: premyelination (P0-P4), highly tolerant to anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; early myelination (P5-P20), partially tolerant of anoxia and aglycemia but not to combined anoxia/aglycemia; late myelination (P21-P49), very low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; and mature (>P50), low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia. The relative resistance of optic nerve function to glucose withdrawal in the presence of oxygen, compared with glucose withdrawal in the absence of oxygen, is presumably due to the presence of oxygen-dependent energy reserves such as astrocytic glycogen, amino acids. and phospholipids.

TI  - Feeding response to mercaptoacetate in Osborne-Mendel and S5B/PL rats.  
AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to determine if Osborne-Mendel (OM) rats, which are susceptible to dietary-induced obesity, and S5B/PL (S5B) rats, which are resistant to dietary-induced obesity, differ in their feeding responses to mercaptoacetate (MA), which blocks fatty acid oxidation, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), which blocks glucose utilization. 2DG (100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg) increased food intake in both strains of rats on a high-fat diet (56% energy from fat). Mercaptoacetate (600 mumol/kg) increased food intake in OM but not S5B rats on a high-fat diet. When maintained on a low-fat diet (10% energy from fat), MA (400 mumol/kg or 600 mumol/kg) stimulated food intake in OM rats, whereas S5B rats increased food intake only after the highest dose of MA (600 mumol/kg). MA stimulated carbohydrate and protein intake in OM rats maintained on a macronutrient selection diet, whereas S5B rats maintained on this diet did not significantly increase intake of any macronutrient after MA. These results demonstrate that OM and S5B rats have a similar food intake response to 2DG but a dissimilar response to MA. The variable response to MA in these strains may be due to a difference in peripheral or central signaling systems related to fatty acid oxidation or a difference in metabolic environments between the strains, which in turn affects the feeding response to MA. These studies suggest that a difference in control of fatty acid oxidation may account for the difference in susceptibility to obesity when eating a high-fat diet.

AB  - The chloride conductance in brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from pig kidney cortex was investigated using a light-scattering assay, anion-diffusion-potential-dependent Na+-D-glucose cotransport and 36Cl- influx. K+-diffusion-potential-driven salt exit from, or entry into, the vesicles was slow in the presence of gluconate, SO42- and F-, intermediate with Cl- and Br-, and fast with I-, NO3-, and SCN-. Stimulation of Na+-D-glucose uptake followed a similar anion sequence. Conductive Cl- flux had a low activation energy and was inhibited by suphhydryl reagents, the stilbene disulphonates 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonate (SITS) and 4, 4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-disulphonate (DIDS), and the arylaminobenzoates diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB). Intravesicular Ca2+ and extravesicular nucleotides were without effect on conductive Cl- flux. These characteristics tentatively exclude some known Cl- channels and leave members of the ClC family as possible candidates responsible for the Cl- conductance in brush-border membranes.

TI  - Immature tubules are tolerant of oxygen deprivation.  
AB  - The tolerance of immature tissues to injury has been noted over the past several decades. Traditional teaching relates this tolerance to energy derived from anaerobic glycolysis. This mini-review describes investigations of the hypothesis that the immature kidney is less susceptible to oxygen deprivation than the mature kidney. Utilizing proximal tubule suspensions from immature and mature rats, studies assessing ATP levels as an index of cellular energy and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a determinant of plasma membrane damage demonstrate the developing kidney is resistant to prolonged anoxia. ATP is maintained at twofold higher levels during anoxia in the immature tubule compared with the mature tubule. The contribution of anaerobic glycolysis to the tolerance of the immature renal tubules is investigated by two inhibitors of the glycolytic pathway, L-glucose and iodoacetate. Following 70%-90% inhibition of glycolysis, ATP is decreased to similar levels in immature and mature tubules. However, immature tubules remain resistant to anoxic damage with no significant change in LDH release. Therefore, enhanced glycolytic activity does not play a dominant role in the tolerance of the developing kidney to anoxia, and this tolerance is not primarily dependent on preservation of cellular ATP.

TI  - [Millemetre waves inhibit the synergistic effect of calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol ester in neutrophil respiratory burst]  
AB  - The effect of extremely high frequency electromagnetic field (mm-waves) on respiratory burst of neutrophils was studied. The peritoneal evoked neutrophils of the mice (NMRI line) were used. The production of reactive oxygen species was estimated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence technique. Cells were irradiated by the mm-waves of 41. 95 GHz in the far field zone of the channel radiator during 20 min.  Absorbed energy flux density was 150 microW/cm2. The irradiation was carried out at different concentrations of calcium ionophore A23187 and then neutrophils were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 1 microM, activator of PKC. At irradiation of neutrophils the synergistic action of A23187 and PMA was not changed at low concentration of ionophore 10 nM-0.5 microM and was suppressed at high concentrations 0.5-10 microM. The largest inhibition of about 60% was obtained at the concentration of A23187 20 microM. The effect of mm-waves was not found under exposure in Ca(2+)-free medium for all used A23187 concentrations. We suggest that the mm-wave effect on the production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils is determined by the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and PKC.

AB  - The regional distribution of brain metabolites was studied in several cortical white and gray matter areas, cerebellum, and thalamus of young adults with use of quantitative single-voxel proton MRS at 2.0 T. Whereas the neuronal compound N-acetylaspartate is distributed homogeneously throughout the brain, N-acetylaspartylglutamate increases caudally and exhibits higher concentrations in white matter than in gray matter. Creatine, myo-inositol, glutamate, and glutamine are less concentrated in cortical white matter than in gray matter. The highest creatine levels are found in cerebellum, parallel to the distribution of creatine kinase and energy-requiring processes in the brain. Also myo-inositol has highest concentrations in the cerebellum. Choline-containing compounds exhibit a marked regional variability with again highest concentrations in cerebellum and lowest levels and a strong caudally decreasing gradient in gray matter. The present findings neither support a metabolic gender difference (except for a 1.3-fold higher myo-inositol level in parietal white matter of female subjects) nor a metabolic hemispheric asymmetry.

TI  - Mechanical energy contribution of the metatarsophalangeal joint to running and sprinting.  
AB  - Despite the fact that a number of studies have investigated lower extremity energy generation during locomotion, the influence of the metatarsophalangeal (MP) joint remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of the MP joint to the total mechanical energy in running and sprinting. A sagittal plane analysis was performed on data collected from 10 trained male athletes (five runners and five sprinters). The MP moment was assumed to be negligible until the ground reaction force acted distal to the joint. During running, once the ground reaction force crossed the MP joint, the MP moment was plantarflexor for the remainder of ground contact with average peak values of 59.9 Nm. The MP joint moment was plantarflexor throughout the stance phase for sprinting with average peak values of 112.4 Nm. Since the MP joint was dorsiflexing throughout the majority of the stance phase the joint absorbed large amounts of energy, on average 20.9 J during running and 47.8 J during sprinting. A lack of plantarflexion of the MP joint resulted in a lack of energy generation during take-off. Thus, the energy that was absorbed at the joint was dissipated in the shoe and foot structures.

TI  - Advances in fetal echocardiography.  
AB  - Fetal echocardiography is the primary modality for defining and evaluating fetal cardiac status and requires detailed analysis of the cardiac anatomy from numerous views and Doppler interrogation of the intracardiac structures, great vessels, and umbilical artery. Referrals for fetal echocardiography are determined by fetal, maternal, or familial risk factors; however, approximately 50% of neonates diagnosed with a congenital cardiac defect have no risk factor, and most have undergone an obstetrical ultrasound during the pregnancy that did not detect a cardiac defect. Advances in transducer technology have resulted in the development of small high-frequency transvaginal probes that allow fetal cardiac interrogation earlier during gestation. On the horizon is 3-dimensional fetal echocardiography, which provides rapid image acquisition and tremendous computer image reconstruction ability. At present, the computer image data analysis process is lengthy, and several technical limitations must be overcome before 3-dimensional fetal echocardiography becomes the primary modality of fetal cardiac imaging. New Doppler Tissue Imaging using color Doppler energy mapping allows more precise anatomic definition of the fetal endocardium, facilitating diagnosis of small ventricular septal defects. These new advances, along with improved image resolution, provide obstetricians and pediatric cardiologists with more tools and techniques for earlier and more precise detection of fetuses with cardiac defects.

TI  - The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1. A minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework reveals coupled binding of RNA and nucleotide.  
AB  - eIF4A is the archetypal member of the DEAD box family of proteins and has been proposed to use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind structures in the 5'-untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs during translation initiation. As a step toward understanding the mechanism of action of this class of enzymes, a minimal kinetic and thermodynamic framework for the RNA-activated ATPase function has been established for eIF4A. The enzyme's affinity for ssRNA is modulated by the binding of ATP.Mg2+ and ADP.Mg2+: the affinity of the E.ATP complex for ssRNA is approximately 40-fold higher than that of the E.ADP complex. The enzyme binds its substrates in a random manner; contrary to previous suggestions, neither ATP binding nor hydrolysis is required for binding of single-stranded RNA. The presence or absence of the gamma-phosphate on the bound nucleotide acts as a switch that modulates the enzyme's structure and ssRNA affinity. The data presented in this and the following paper in this issue suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis produce a cycle of conformational and RNA affinity changes in eIF4A. Such cycles may be used by DEAD box proteins to transduce the energy from ATP hydrolysis into physical work, thereby allowing each member of this family to rearrange its RNA or RNA.protein target.

TI  - Low energy availability, not stress of exercise, alters LH pulsatility in exercising women.  
AB  - We tested two hypotheses about the disruption of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in exercising women by assaying LH in blood samples drawn at 10-min intervals over 24 h from nine young, habitually sedentary, regularly menstruating women on days 8, 9, or 10 of two menstrual cycles after 4 days of intense exercise [E = 30 kcal.kg lean body mass (LBM)-1.day-1 at 70% of aerobic capacity]. To test the hypothesis that LH pulsatility is disrupted by low energy availability, we controlled the subjects' dietary energy intakes (I) to set their energy availabilities (A = I - E) at 45 and 10 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1 during the two trials. To test the hypothesis that LH pulsatility is disrupted by the stress of exercise, we compared the resulting LH pulsatilities to those previously reported in women with similar controlled energy availability who had not exercised. In the exercising women, low energy availability reduced LH pulse frequency by 10% (P < 0.01) during the waking hours and increased LH pulse amplitude by 36% (P = 0.05) during waking and sleeping hours, but this reduction in LH pulse frequency was blunted by 60% (P = 0.03) compared with that in the previously studied nonexercising women whose low energy availability was caused by dietary restriction. The stress of exercise neither reduced LH pulse frequency nor increased LH pulse amplitude (all P > 0.4). During exercise, the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrate oxidation was reduced from 73% while A = 45 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1 to 49% while A = 10 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1 (P < 0.0001). These results contradict the hypothesis that LH pulsatility is disrupted by exercise stress and suggest that LH pulsatility in women depends on energy availability.

TI  - Neuroanatomical patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity induced by naltrexone in food-restricted and ad libitum fed rats.  
AB  - Chronic food restriction produces a variety of adaptive changes in physiology and behavior aimed at the preservation of energy homeostasis. The brain opioid system may be involved in the adaptation to food restriction since regional levels of opioid peptides, precursor mRNA, and receptor binding have previously been observed. In the present study, c-Fos immunohistochemistry was used to localize cells that are released from opioid-mediated inhibition by naltrexone under conditions of food restriction and ad libitum feeding. In the majority of hypothalamic and forebrain areas examined, Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) was higher in food-restricted rats regardless of injection treatment. This may reflect the persistent stress of underfeeding or the synchronizing effect of afternoon feeding on spontaneous c-fos mRNA expression in food-restricted rats. In two brain regions, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central amygdala (CEA), naltrexone increased FLI in ad libitum fed rats, exclusively. This result suggests the presence of tonic opioid secretion under basal conditions that is suppressed by food restriction. Interestingly, work in other laboratories indicates that anorectic agents consistently increase FLI in BNST and CEA. In three brain regions--lateral (LH), dorsomedial (DMH) and arcuate hypothalamus (ARC)--naltrexone increased FLI in food-restricted rats, exclusively. This result suggests the presence of opioid secretion that is unique to the state of food restriction. The hypothalamic pattern of FLI is discussed in terms of NPY-opioid interactions that result from the ARC response to changes in circulating insulin, corticosterone and leptin levels during food restriction.

TI  - Simulated front crawl swimming performance related to critical speed and critical power.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Competitive pool swimming events range in distance from 50 to 1500 m. Given the difference in performance times (+/- 23-1000 s), the contribution of the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems changes considerably with race distance. In training practice the regression line between swimming distance and time (Distance = critical velocity x time + anaerobic swimming capacity) is used to determine the individual capacity of the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways. Although there is confidence that critical velocity and anaerobic swimming capacity are fitness measures that separate aerobic and anaerobic components, a firm theoretical basis for the interpretation of these results does not exist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the critical power concept and anaerobic swimming capacity as measures of the aerobic and anaerobic capacity using a modeling approach. METHODS: A systems model was developed that relates the mechanics and energetics involved in front crawl swimming performance. From actual swimming flume measurements, the time dependent aerobic and anaerobic energy release was modeled. Data derived from the literature were used to relate the energy cost of front crawl swimming to swimming velocity. A balance should exist between the energy cost to swim a distance in a certain time and the concomitant aerobic and anaerobic energy release. The ensuing model was used to predict performance times over a range of distances (50-1500 m) and to calculate the regression line between swimming distance and time. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensitivity analysis, it was demonstrated that the critical velocity is indicative for the capacity of the aerobic energy system. Estimates of the anaerobic swimming capacity, however, were influenced by variations in both anaerobic and aerobic energy release. Therefore, it was concluded that the anaerobic swimming capacity does not provide a reliable estimate of the anaerobic capacity.

TI  - Quantification of anaerobic energy production during intense exercise.  
AB  - Anaerobic energy production during supramaximal exercise has been estimated from muscle metabolic changes. Based on such measurements the anaerobic energy production was determined to be 63 and 189 mmol ATP x kg(-1) d.w. for 60 and 142 s of exhaustive cycling exercise, respectively. These estimations do not, however, include release of lactate from the exercising muscles. Furthermore, the anaerobic production cannot be related to the work performed since the muscle biopsy sample may not be representative for the muscles involved in the exercise, and the total anaerobic energy production during whole body exercise cannot be determined because the mass of the muscles used is unknown. When a single muscle is exercised, the problems are minimized. With a one-legged knee-extensor exercise model, which uses a defined muscle mass, the anaerobic energy production has been estimated to be 370 mmol ATP x kg(-1) d.w. for a 192-s exhaustive exercise period. Estimated pulmonary oxygen deficit based on an energy demand extrapolated from a linear relationship between exercise intensity and oxygen uptake at submaximal exercise does not appear to represent the anaerobic energy production during whole body exercise.

TI  - During intense exercise, obese women rely more than lean women on aerobic energy.  
AB  - A series of untrained, healthy, obese women (body mass index 32.5 +/- 0.9 kg.m-2) were subjected to a protocol of intense exercise on a cycloergometer and compared with lean controls (body mass index 20. 9 +/- 0.5 kg.m-2). Physiological parameters, blood lactate, bicarbonate, plasma metabolites, oxygen consumption and CO2 production were measured. Impedance-derived extracellular water and plasma changes in lactate and bicarbonate were used to determine changes in bicarbonate pools and lactate-displaced CO2. From these and respiratory gases, the respiratory quotient was calculated and thence overall fuel consumption. Anaerobic energy during exercise accounted for about 1.8% of all energy consumed in the lean but only 0.7% in the obese. Obese women fatigued at lower workloads and energy expenditure levels than did the lean, and their lactate buildup was similar when compared on the basis of fat-free mass. The data support the postulation of fatigue being triggered by a combination of factors: stretched cardiovascular work would be the main factor for obese women, in part limiting lactate production. For lean women, the triggering factor for fatigue could be the loss of buffering capacity; but it is the combination of stretching cardiovascular capacity, exhaustion of glycogen and available glucose and increase in lactate/loss of bicarbonate buffer that determines the onset of fatigue.

TI  - Flexibility of the B-DNA backbone: effects of local and neighbouring sequences on pyrimidine-purine steps.  
AB  - The structurally correlated dihedral angles epsilon and zeta are known for their large variability within the B-DNA backbone. We have used molecular modelling to study both energetic and mechanical features of these variations which can produce BI/BII transitions. Calculations were carried out on DNA oligomers containing either YpR or RpY dinucleotides steps within various sequence environments. The results indicate that CpA and CpG steps favour the BI/BII transition more than TpA or any RpY step.  The stacking energy and its intra- and inter-strand components explain these effects. Analysis of neighbouring base pairs reveals that BI/BII transitions of CpG and CpA are easiest within (Y)n(R)n sequences. These can also induce a large vibrational amplitude for TpA steps within the BI conformation.

TI  - Evidence that eating frequency is inversely related to body weight status in male, but not female, non-obese adults reporting valid dietary intakes.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between eating frequency (EF) and body weight status and to determine whether these relationships can be explained in terms of differences in physical activity levels, macronutrient intakes or energy compensation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design; free-living subjects, 48 men and 47 women (aged 20-55 y, body mass index (BMI) 18-30), recruited in a workplace setting. MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight; skinfold thickness (four sites); EF, energy and macronutrient intakes (food diary, unweighed, recorded for seven consecutive days); physical activity (7 d activity diary and heart rate monitoring over 48 h period). RESULTS: In men there was a significant negative correlation between EF and body weight, and an inverse relationship with body mass index (BMI). EF was positively correlated with % energy from carbohydrate, although not with total energy intake. In women, there was no relationship between EF and body weight status; however, there were significant positive correlations between EF and total energy intake, and between EF and intakes of total carbohydrate and sugars. For both men and women, there were associations between EF and physical activity levels, approaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In men, the association between increased EF and lower body weight status may have been influenced by increased physical activity levels. As energy intake did not increase with EF, men appear to have compensated by reducing the mean energy consumed per eating episode. Energy compensation did not take place in women, with women who ate most frequently having the highest energy intakes, although this did not lead to higher BMIs. Physical activity, through participation in active leisure pursuits, may have been an important factor in weight control in women. The % contribution of carbohydrate to total energy was positively correlated with EF in both men and women, and further analysis showed that snack foods provided a higher proportion of carbohydrate than did foods eaten as meals. These results indicate that a high EF is likely to lead to a high carbohydrate diet, which may be favourable for weight control. Our findings suggest that in this population, a high EF was associated with leanness in men, and there was no link between EF and body weight status in women.

TI  - Effects of pulmonary embolism on pulmonary vascular impedance in dogs and minipigs.  
AB  - Pigs have been reported to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0-Hz impedance (Z0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile hydraulic power to total hydraulic power. Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40-55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z0 and Z1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile hydraulic power to total hydraulic power.  The energy transmission ratio, defined as the hydraulic power in the measured waves divided by the hydraulic power in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of hydraulic power and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.

During the energy restriction period, the metabolizable energy of the diets was positively correlated with the plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I, which was positively correlated with daily body weight (BW) gain during this period and the plasma concentration of total thyroxin. During the first 37 d of the realimentation period, compensatory growth occurred, and the rate of increase in plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I was positively correlated with that of daily BW gain. At d 37 of the compensatory period, the mean plasma concentration of total thyroxin in calves in three of the four groups did not differ significantly; only the concentration of total thyroxin in the plasma of calves fed the highest energy restricted diet was significantly higher. The mean BW of calves in groups fed the high energy diets during the restriction period tended to be heavier even after 158 d of the realimentation period.

TI  - Conformational analysis of methyl 6-O-[(R)- and (S)-1-carboxyethyl]-alpha-D-galactopyranoside by MM and Langevin dynamics simulations.  
AB  - The conformational space of methyl 6-O-[(R)- and (S)-1-carboxyethyl]-alpha-D-galactopyranoside has been investigated. A grid search employing energy minimization at each grid point over the three major degrees of freedom, namely phi, psi and omega, identified low energy regions. The R-isomer shows five low energy conformers within ca. 1 kcal mol(-1) of the global energy minimum. The S-isomer has two conformers within a few tenths of a kcal mol(-1) of the global energy minimum. Langevin dynamics simulations have been have been performed at 300 K for 30 ns of each isomer. The phi dihedral angle has as its major conformer (g-) for the R-isomer whereas it is the (g+) conformer for the S-isomer. For the psi dihedral angle the (t) conformer has the highest population for both isomers. The dihedral angle omega has the (g+) conformer most highly populated, both for the R- and S-isomer. The above five and two conformational states for the R- and S-isomers, respectively, make up 90% in each case of the populated states during the Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations. Rate constants for the omega dihedral angle have been calculated based on a number correlation function. Three bond homo- and heteronuclear, i.e. proton and carbon-13, coupling constants have been calculated from the dynamics trajectories for comparison to experimental values. The heteronuclear coupling constant H2',C6 has been measured for the S-isomer and found to be 3.3 Hz. The J value calculated from the LD simulations, namely 2.6 Hz, is in fair agreement with experiment. A comparison to the X-ray structure of the R-isomer shows that the conformation of the crystalline compound occupies the low energy region most highly populated as a single R-conformer (30%) during the LD simulations.

TI  - Microscopically controlled surgical excision combined with ultrapulse CO2 vaporization in the management of a patient with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.  
AB  - Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, skeletal abnormalities and sometimes mental retardation. The large number of tumors, which are often disfiguring, presents extreme difficulties in the treatment of these patients. Microscopically controlled excision, compared to other modalities (radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, intralesional interferon alpha-2b) offers the highest cure rate. However, because of the large size and involvement of wide areas of the skin, this approach is sometimes impractical. The ultrapulse CO2 laser with high energy and short pulses achieves char-free ablation of the tumors, bloodless surgical field, minimal nonspecific thermal damage, rapid healing and diminished postoperative pain. Also, a number of lesions can be removed in a single session. We present a 48-year-old man with a 6.5 x 4.5 cm large basal cell carcinoma involving the anterior abdomen and navel area. The central thick portion of the tumor was resected by microscopically controlled excision with 3 stages, and wide thinner peripheral crescentic plaque vaporized with ultrapulse CO2 laser. The laser settings were 300 mJ energy/pulse and 100 W average power, which corresponds to the fluence of 7.5 J/cm2. Computerized pattern generator (ultrascan handpiece) was adjusted to patterns of 3 (circle) and 1 (square) with sizes varying from 5 to 7, and density of 9 (60% overlapping). The tumor was vaporized with 6 passes, all the way to deep reticular dermis. A fifteen month-follow up disclosed no recurrent disease. Subsequent biopsies revealed only a scar with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Our experience indicates that combined treatment with microscopically controlled excision and ultrapulse CO2 laser ablation is a suitable modality for the large tumor plaques involving concave and convex areas of the skin respectively. Microscopically controlled excision of thicker, concave portions of basal cell carcinoma plaques, where CO2 laser surgery is less feasible, presents an effective addition that renders this combined modality a successful method for the treatment of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

TI  - Photon energy recovery: a method to improve the effective energy resolution of gamma cameras.  
AB  - One of the major limitations of gamma cameras is their relatively poor energy resolution. The main practical consequence of this is that the detection of both scattered and unscattered photons in the photopeak energy window, affecting image contrast and resolution, makes the data inconsistent with the assumption of scatter-free projection data in reconstruction and attenuation correction algorithms. Here, we proposed a method to improve the effective energy resolution of scintigraphic acquisitions. This method is called photon energy recovery (PER). METHODS: Photon energy recovery is based on a spectral deconvolution analysis and uses iterative recurrent linear regressions. In practice, PER only required splitting the photopeak energy window into several subwindows and did not need list mode acquisitions. The method was fully automated. Photon energy recovery was quantitatively validated on 99mTc planar images using a Monte Carlo simulation and a real phantom and was illustrated by a bone study. RESULTS: The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that convergence was reached within relatively few (10-15) iterations.  Photon energy recovery led to a considerable quantitative improvement because the mean error between the photopeak energy window image and the true unscattered image was equal to 8.72 s.d. (the mean error between one image and the true image was the mean of the differences between the two images; the difference is expressed as several s.d., where s.d. was the square root of the true value), whereas the mean error between the 140-keV PER image and the true unscattered image was only equal to 2.70. Moreover, the true and PER spectra were highly correlated. The real phantom data pointed out that the counts in the 140-keV PER image calculated from the images acquired "with scatter" were not very different from the true counts given by the "scatter-free" reference image. Planar pelvic bone scintigraphy demonstrated the advantages of PER because contrast increased when only unscattered photons were selected. CONCLUSION: Photon energy recovery is a stable and automated method that allows recovery of the correct value of the photon energy after a scintigraphic acquisition. Its ability to separate scattered from unscattered events has been quantitatively validated.

TI  - Reducing the influence of the partial volume effect on SPECT activity quantitation with 3D modelling of spatial resolution in iterative reconstruction.  
AB  - Quantitative parameters such as the maximum and total counts in a volume are influenced by the partial volume effect. The magnitude of this effect varies with the non-stationary and anisotropic spatial resolution in SPECT slices. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether iterative reconstruction which includes modelling of the three-dimensional (3D) spatial resolution of SPECT imaging can reduce the impact of the partial volume effect on the quantitation of activity compared with filtered backprojection (FBP) techniques which include low-pass, and linear restoration filtering using the frequency distance relationship (FDR). The iterative reconstruction algorithms investigated were maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM), MLEM with ordered subset acceleration (ML-OS), and MLEM with acceleration by the rescaled-block-iterative technique (ML-RBI). The SIMIND Monte Carlo code was used to simulate small hot spherical objects in an elliptical cylinder with and without uniform background activity as imaged by a low-energy ultra-high-resolution (LEUHR) collimator. Centre count ratios (CCRs) and total count ratios (TCRs) were determined as the observed counts over true counts. CCRs were unstable while TCRs had a bias of approximately 10% for all iterative techniques. The variance in the TCRs for ML-OS and ML-RBI was clearly elevated over that of MLEM, with ML-RBI having the smaller elevation. TCRs obtained with FDR-Wiener filtering had a larger bias (approximately 30%) than any of the iterative reconstruction methods but near stationarity is also reached. Butterworth filtered results varied by 9.7% from the centre to the edge. The addition of background has an influence on the convergence rate and noise properties of iterative techniques.

TI  - Basal metabolism does not account for high O2 consumption in stunned myocardium.  
AB  - Myocardial O2 consumption (MVo2) in stunned myocardium is relatively high compared with the reduced ventricular function. The mechanism of this "oxygen paradox" could occur at different levels: basal metabolism, excitation-contraction coupling, and energy production. In one previously reported series on 12 isolated, blood-perfused rabbit hearts, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in stunned myocardium were significantly decreased compared with control, whereas total MVo2 was not. The MVo2 for the unloaded contraction was overproportionately high for the decreased function in stunned myocardium, and contractile efficiency was clearly deteriorated. To assess whether the basal metabolism specifically is elevated in stunned myocardium, a second series (n = 14) with a similar protocol was performed in this study. Basal MVo2 after KCl arrest (0.5 +/- 0.3 ml.min-1.100 g-1) was significantly lower than that measured after KCl arrest (1.2 +/- 0.5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) in an additional series on nonischemic hearts (n = 8). Our conclusion is that basal MVo2 in stunned myocardium is not elevated. Thus this O2-consuming portion of total MVo2 is not responsible for the inefficiency in stunned myocardium. Instead, a "metabolic stunning" occurs at the level of both excitation-contraction coupling and force development by the contractile apparatus.

TI  - Changes in carbohydrate metabolism of testicular germ cells during meiosis in the rat.  
AB  - A study was undertaken to estimate the activities of the key enzymes of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in purified rat spermatocytes and spermatids, which have been shown to die in glucose-containing medium and require lactate/pyruvate for maintaining normal ATP concentrations. The aim was to elucidate the changes in the glycolytic and oxidative potential of germ cells undergoing meiosis. Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from adult rat testis were purified to approximately 90% purity by trypsin digestion followed by a combination of centrifugal elutriation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. After the purity and viability of these cells had been established, their contents of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and LDH-X of glycolysis, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase of the pentose phosphate pathway and citrate synthase, aconitase, malate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase of the TCA cycle were estimated. These enzymes were also estimated in epididymal spermatozoa for comparison with the testicular germ cells. The results indicate greater activity of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes in spermatocytes than in spermatids, which exhibited greater activity of TCA cycle enzymes than the former. The difference in activity was statistically significant for most of the enzymes studied. In contrast, spermatozoa exhibited markedly greater activity of glycolytic enzymes and significantly lower activity of pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle enzymes than did the testicular germ cells. We conclude that the unusual dependence of spermatids exclusively on lactate may be due to their lower glycolytic potential, whereas spermatocytes with comparatively greater glycolytic activity have an intermediate dependence on lactate and are therefore able to utilise lactate, pyruvate, or both, while retaining a better ability to utilise glucose. Spermatozoa with the greatest glycolytic potential and the lowest TCA cycle activity appear to be 'programmed' to utilise exclusively glucose/fructose for energy.

TI  - Electron transfer in ruthenium-modified spinach plastocyanin mutants.  
AB  - Four site-directed mutants of spinach plastocyanin, Pc(Leu12His), Pc(Leu15His), Pc(Thr79His), and Pc(Lys81His), have been modified by covalent attachment of a photoactive [Ru(bpy)2(im)]2+ complex at the surface-exposed histidine residues. The Pc-Ru complexes were characterized with optical absorption, CD, and EPR spectroscopy and their spectra were found to be similar to the unmodified proteins except in the case of the Pc(Leu12His) mutant which lost the Cu ion irreversibly during the Ru modification. Electron transfer (ET) within the other Pc-Ru complexes was studied with time-resolved optical spectroscopy, using an external-quencher approach. The fully reduced [Cu(I), Ru(II)] proteins were photoexcited and subsequently oxidized by an external quencher, [Ru(NH3)6]Cl3, forming the [Cu(I), Ru(III)] proteins. This was followed by an internal ET from Cu(I) to Ru(III). The rates of the internal ET reactions exhibit an exponential dependence on metal-to-metal separation, with a decay factor of 1.1 A-1. From a temperature-dependence study of the Ru-modified Pc(Lys81His) protein, a reorganization energy for the Cu-to-Ru ET reaction of 1.2 eV was determined. In this analysis it was found necessary to include an appreciable temperature dependence in the driving force of the ET reaction. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

Increasing ambient temperature had no significant effect on food intake by weight, but the proportion of the high energy choice decreased and, conversely, the proportion of the lower-energy but higher-protein choice increased. 4. Energy intake was therefore negatively correlated with ambient temperature, but protein intake per unit of energy intake increased, allowing the birds to gain weight at about the same rate at all temperatures. 5. Heat production decreased as ambient temperature increased. Respiratory quotient decreased with increasing temperature, which indicates a reduced utilisation of carbohydrate as an energy source. 6. Water intake increased with temperature but there were no overt signs of heat stress and there was no significant change in body temperature. 7. Japanese quail selected a dietary mixture which maintained similar growth rates over a wide range of ambient temperature, by sustaining protein intake but altering energy intake in line with thermoregulatory energy demands.

TI  - Effect of mild hypothermia during and after transient in vitro ischemia on metabolic disturbances in hippocampal slices at different stages of development.  
AB  - In the present study the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia (decrease of temperature from 37 degrees C to 33 degrees C) during and after transient ischemia in brain tissue at different stages of development was tested in vitro by measuring energy metabolism, glutamate release and protein biosynthesis rate (PSR) in hippocampal slices. Slices were taken from immature (E40) and mature (E60) guinea pig fetuses and adult guinea pigs. The slices were exposed to ischemia-like conditions (oxygen/glucose deprivation, OGD) for periods of between 10 to 40 min followed by a 2-h or 12-h recovery phase. During OGD, mild hypothermia slowed down the depletion of energy stores only in slices from immature fetuses, but had no effect on slices prepared from mature fetuses and adult animals. Hypothermia also reduced glutamate release significantly during oxygen/glucose deprivation. Lowering temperature to 33 degrees C had no effect on energy metabolism and only a minor effect on PSR of slices from mature fetuses and adult animals subjected to 2 h of recovery. However, 12 h after OGD PSR was markedly improved by mild hypothermia in slices from mature animals and in slices from adults that had been exposed to OGD for only 20 or 30 min. The inhibition of PSR was more severe in the slices from adults than in those from mature fetuses subjected to the same duration of OGD. Age- and temperature-related differences in glutamate release during OGD did not fully agree with corresponding disparities in the values for PSR obtained 12 h after OGD. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of mild hypothermia was not mediated by a temperature-dependent retardation of the depletion of energy stores during OGD. Age-related disparities in the vulnerability of the brain to ischemia and the neuroprotective efficiency of mild hypothermia appear to be only partially reflected by the varying levels of glutamate release during ischemia but best reflected by the extent of PSR inhibition. It is concluded that mild hypothermia may be a suitable therapeutical intervention for the suppression of hypoxic-ischemic cell damage during birth.

TI  - Therapeutic range of repetitive nanosecond laser exposures in selective RPE photocoagulation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether selective damage the RPE while sparing the adjacent photoreceptors is possible with repetitive 200-ns pulses of Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) and what potential side effects can be expected with higher pulse energies. METHODS: We irradiated the retinas of 19 eyes of 10 chinchilla rabbits with 500 pulses from a Nd:YAG laser, each 200 ns in duration, at a repetition rate of 500 Hz (158 microns, 0-120 microJ). Threshold curves for different effects were established. Representative lesions were investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: It was possible to produce lesions, which were only visible by fluorescein angiography. The ED50 threshold energy per pulse for visibility by fluorescein angiography was 2.1 microJ per pulse, for visibility by ophthalmoscopy 8.6 microJ. Bubble formation, an uncommon phenomenon in retinal photocoagulation, occurred at energies of 15-25 microJ. Hemorrhage occurred at surprisingly high energy levels of more than 100 microJ. Histology performed on lesions visible only by angiography showed damage primarily to the RPE and outer segments, with very little damage to some inner segments dependent on the energy used. CONCLUSIONS: Selective RPE damage is possible with repetitive 200-ns laser pulses and appropriate energy; however, the collateral damage to the adjacent retina is more pronounced than with repetitive microsecond laser pulses. There is no risk of hemorrhage of retinal photocoagulation with the repetitive 200-ns laser pulses at low energy levels which would be used clinically.

Our method is based on the following assumptions: information needed to correct for scattering can be extracted from the energy spectrum at each pixel without any assumption concerning the source distribution, and two diametrically opposed energy spectrum acquisitions yield enough information on the source location in the diffusing medium for simultaneous correction for attenuation and scattering.

TI  - Artificial neural network as a tool to compensate for scatter and attenuation in radionuclide imaging.  
AB  - This study investigates the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to simultaneously correct for attenuation and Compton scattering in scintigraphic imaging. METHODS: Three sets of experiments are conducted using images of radioactive sources with various shapes and distributions in a homogeneous medium. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations and physical phantom acquisitions of radioactive geometric sources provide the basic material for correction. Our method is based on the following assumptions: information needed to correct for scattering can be extracted from the energy spectrum at each pixel without any assumption concerning the source distribution, and two diametrically opposed energy spectrum acquisitions yield enough information on the source location in the diffusing medium for simultaneous correction for attenuation and scattering. RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of scatter correction by ANN demonstrate its ability to perform scatter correction from the energy spectra observed in each pixel. By using the energy spectra of incident photons detected in two diametrically opposed images, multilayer neural networks are able to perform a proper restitution of projection images without any assumption on geometry or position of radioactive sources in simple geometric cases. ANN corrections compare favorably to those provided by five of the most popular methods. A satisfying correction of both scatter and attenuation is observed for a human pelvis scan obtained during routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION: An ANN is an efficient tool for attenuation and Compton scattering in simple model cases. The results obtained for routine scintigrams in a much more complex situation are strong incentives for performing further studies.

TI  - ATP-Dependent human erythrocyte glutathione-conjugate transporter. II. Functional reconstitution of transport activity.  
AB  - Purified dinitrophenyl S-glutathione (DNP-SG) ATPase was reconstituted into artificial liposomes prepared from soybean asolectin. Electron micrography confirmed the formation of unilamellar vesicles with an average radius of 0.25 micron. Intravesicular volume estimated by incorporation of radiolabled inulin into the vesicles was found to be 19.7 +/- 1.3 microL/mL reconstitution solution. Accumulation of the glutathione-conjugate of CDNB, DNP-SG, and of doxorubicin (DOX) in the proteoliposomes was increased in the presence of ATP as compared to equimolar ADP or adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-methylene]triphosphate tetralithium. ATP-dependent transmembrane movement of DOX and DNP-SG into DNP-SG ATPase-reconstituted vesicles was saturable with respect to time, sensitive to the osmolarity of the assay medium, and temperature dependent.  The energy of activation was found to be 12 and 15 kcal/mol for DNP-SG and DOX, respectively. Optimal temperature for transport was 37 degrees C. Saturable transport was demonstrated for DNP-SG (Vmax of 433 +/- 20 nmol/min/mg of protein, KmATP = 2.4 +/- 0. 3 mM and KmDNP-SG = 36 +/- 5 microM) as well as DOX (Vmax = 194 +/- 19 nmol/min/mg of protein, KmATP = 2.5 +/- 0.6 mM and KmDOX = 2.4 +/- 0.7 microM). The kinetic data for both DNP-SG and DOX transport were consistent with a random bi-bi sequential reaction mechanism. DOX was found to be a competitive inhibitor of DNP-SG transport with Kis of 1.2 +/- 0.2 microM and DNP-SG was found to be a competitive inhibitor of DOX transport with Kis of 13.3 +/- 2.6 microM.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms for cooperative folding of proteins.  
AB  - The folding of single-domain globular proteins exhibits the character of first-order or two-state thermodynamics. The origin of such high cooperativity in relatively small polymer systems is still not well understood. Recently, the statistical mechanics of protein folding has been studied extensively with simple protein models such as short cubic-lattice chains with contact-based interactions. While many valuable insights about protein folding were gained with such models, some concerns have also arisen, viz. that they lack the character of protein backbones whose interactions would limit the folding patterns of proteins. Here, a comparative study of the conventional cubic-lattice chain model and a fine-grained more realistic lattice protein model with both backbone and side-chain interactions is carried out. It is found that, even though both types of models exhibit a cooperative two-state folding transition to the native structure with optimized force fields, the character and origin of cooperativity of the two models are different. In the simple contact-based model, the free-energy barrier occurs at the low end of the energy scale, and the cooperativity arises from a concerted formation of native contacts among many residues in a compact state. In the other more complicated model, the free-energy barrier occurs in the intermediate energy region, and the folding cooperativity arises from collective orientational arrangements of locally structured units in semi-open conformational states. On the basis of these results, two limiting molecular mechanisms for protein folding emerge, which can be used for analyzing the folding process of real proteins.

TI  - Channelling free energy into work in biological processes.  
AB  - The process by which free energy from ATP or an ion gradient is coupled to work--either osmotic work, by a membrane pump, or mechanical work, by a molecular motor--as well as the development of force by a molecular motor, can be explained by mechanisms dependent on substrate binding energy. Coupling involves a reaction sequence that combines the driving and driven reactions and that is controlled at switch points where the mobility of the coupling protein and its specificity in binding and catalysis can be abruptly altered; the altered state is an intermediate (or transition state) in the coupled reaction, the unaltered state an intermediate in the uncoupled reaction (slippage). The balance between these states, which is determined by the increase in substrate binding energy in the transformation, decides the relative importance of the coupled and uncoupled paths. On this basis a general expression for switching may be derived: the tightness of coupling is limited by a ratio of substrate dissociation constants before and after a controlling change in state: Rate(coupled)/Rate(uncoupled) < or = Kinitial state/Kfinal state. When binding energy is used in this way to distort the conformation of a protein, mechanical work is done; the work is internal but becomes external if the protein is connected to an external load. External work, force F multiplied by distance d, is then limited by a ratio of substrate dissociation constants before and after the conformational change: W = Fd < RT In(Kinitial state/Kfinal state). The ratios of dissociation constants, estimated from published values of the force exerted by molecular motors, are > 1 x 10(4) for myosin and > 2 x 10(4) for kinesin. From the tightness of coupling of the anion exchange carrier of red cells the ratio of constants for coupling is > or = 4 x 10(4). These increments can be accounted for by conversion of a surface complex to an enclosed complex, as in chelate formation. The work done by an ATP-driven motor is limited by the free energy of ATP hydrolysis, but the force developed is independent of the ATP reaction, and comes from binding energy with either the driving or driven substrate.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a unique sulfated ganglioside, sulfated GM1a, from rat kidney.  
AB  - A novel class of sulfoglycosphingolipid, a sulfate analog of ganglioside, was isolated from mammals for the first time. This sulfated ganglioside was purified from rat kidney by column chromatographies on anion exchangers and silica beads. One-dimensional 1H NMR, compositional and permethylation analyses showed that this glycolipid has a Gg4Cer core with 1 mol each of sulfate ester and N- glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) at C-3 of galactose. The major ceramide consisted of nonhydroxy fatty acids (24:0 and 22:0) and 4-hydroxysphinganine (t18:0), deduced from the compositional analysis and negative liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS). Mild acid hydrolysis and solvolysis produced compounds which correspond to Gg4Cer IV3-sulfate (SM1b) and II3NeuGcalpha-Gg4Cer (GM1a (NeuGc)), respectively. The abundant ions characteristic for sulfated mono- and disaccharides in high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra were consistent with the structure at the non-reducing terminus, HSO3 -O- Hex -O- HexNAc- rather than the alternative structure, NeuGc -O- Hex -O- HexNAc-. The two-dimensional 1H NMR further evidenced the presence of a 3 -O- sulfated galactose in the molecule. From these results the complete structure was proposed to be HSO3-3Galbeta-3GalNAcbeta-4(NeuGcalpha-3)Galb eta-4Glcbeta-1Cer (II3NeuGcalpha-Gg4Cer IV3-sulfate).

TI  - Nutrient absorption from a fat-enriched diet in young malnourished children: a randomized controlled trial.  
AB  - A randomized, controlled trial was undertaken to compare nutrient absorption from low fat (22.2% energy as fat) and high fat (48% energy as fat)-containing mixed diets in 39 (26M, 13F) malnourished children aged < 2 y. Subjects of both dietary groups, standard (SDG, n = 18) and experimental (EDG, n = 21), were offered 184.5 ml of feeds/kg body weight/24 h that provided 146 kcal with the low fat diet and 216 kcal with the high fat diet, respectively. The baseline clinical and biochemical parameters and the volume of feeds consumed by the patients in the two groups were comparable. Thus, the subjects in the EDG were ingesting a mean (95% CI) of 50% (23.8%, 76.2%) extra energy than that eaten by the SDG. Coefficients of absorption of energy, nitrogen and carbohydrate were similar in the two dietary groups (p = 0.08-0.98). Median (binomial exact 95% CI) fat absorption among subjects receiving the high fat diet (96.3; 92.9, 98.6) was 7% more than in those consuming the low fat diet (89.3; 86.7, 94.1) (p = 0.01). Subjects of the EDG thus, retained almost 50% additional energy as compared to that by SDG.

TI  - Hydration and dehydration behavior of aspartame hemihydrate.  
AB  - Previous studies have shown that aspartame in the solid state can exist as a hemihydrate which occurs in two different polymorphic forms (I and II). The present work shows that equilibration of either hemihydrate at 25 degrees C with water vapor at relative humidities > or = 58% or with liquid water produces a 2.5-hydrate. Upon subjecting each of these crystalline hydrates to increasing temperature, the same crystalline anhydrate is formed which thermally cyclizes at a higher temperature to form the known compound 3-(carboxymethyl)-6-benzyl-2,5-dioxopiperazine.  The activation energy of the cyclization reaction appears to depend on the degree of crystallinity of the anhydrate that is formed at a lower temperature. On increasing the temperature of the 2.5-hydrate, a hemihydrate intervenes before the anhydrate is formed. This intervening hemihydrate is similar to the commercial form (II) of aspartame hemihydrate but exhibits greater amorphous character. The techniques employed were Karl Fischer titrimetry, powder X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy.

TI  - Calculation of standard transformed Gibbs energies and standard transformed enthalpies of biochemical reactants.  
AB  -  The standard Gibbs energies of formation and standard enthalpies of formation of species involved in biochemical reactions are used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation and standard transformed enthalpies of formation of 53 reactants (sums of species) at 298.15 K, pH 7, and ionic strengths of 0, 0.1, and 0. 25 M. The standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation are used to calculate apparent equilibrium constants K' for 22 biochemical reactions for which apparent equilibrium constants have been determined close to these conditions. This comparison is generally satisfactory given the differences in experimental conditions. The transformed formation properties for the 53 reactants make it possible to calculate transformed formation properties for other reactants involved in biochemical reactions with some of these reactants. This is illustrated by calculating standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation for 11 more reactants without information on the standard Gibbs energies of formation of the species. The list of 64 reactants for which standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation are presented can be considerably extended. The use of tables of standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation to store information on apparent equilibrium constants is more efficient than simply storing apparent equilibrium constants because a reactant can be looked up in a table and may be involved in hundreds of reactions. The effects of magnesium ions on several reactions involving ATP are calculated. The advantages of using enzyme-catalyzed reactions for determining thermodynamic properties of complicated molecules in aqueous solution are discussed. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - Three-year longitudinal study with quantitative ultrasound at the hand phalanx in a female population.  
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted to assess the value of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement in predicting the risk of fracture and to evaluate how QUS parameters change with ageing and the climacteric. A group of 211 female subjects underwent assessment by QUS at the distal metaphysis of the first phalanx of the last four fingers of the hand on two occasions 3 years apart. The subjects were selected from outpatients attending the orthopaedic clinic, provided they were not affected by metabolic disease or under treatment with drugs known to interfere with bone metabolism. In vivo the coefficient of variation and the standardized coefficient of variation of the QUS device were respectively 0.5% and 3.5%. The correlation between the values of the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) in the two measurements was r = 0.92. In 77.3% of the subjects during the observation period we recorded a reduction in AD-SoS. During the study 22 fractures were observed in peripheral sites, 8 of which were associated with 'low-energy trauma'. By multiple logistic regression analysis we found that the relative risk of fracture for a 1 SD reduction in AD-SoS was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-1.7) (p < 0.03). The percentage of low-energy fractures significantly increased among those subjects with an AD-SoS value lower than 1850 m/s (T-score < -3.5) at the first examination (p <0.0001). QUS investigation proved to be especially sensitive to hormonal changes associated with the climacteric: we observed a mean decrease of 56 m/s in the AD-SoS for women who entered the menopause between the first and the second QUS test (average time since menopause 2 years), as against 10 m/s in subjects remaining premenopausal. In a group of 146 subjects with 'normal' Ad-SoS at the first examination, we observed a significant reduction in AD-SoS only after 40 years of age. This study demonstrates that measurement of the AD-SoS at the phalanx is reproducible, can be employed to assess the risk of fracture, and is able to detect age-related alterations in bone tissue.

TI  - MMC and LD simulations of alpha-D-Manp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Glcp-OMe: comparison to long-range heteronuclear NMR coupling constants and to the crystal structure.  
AB  - The conformational flexibility and the dynamics of alpha-D-Manp(1-->2)-beta-D-Glcp-OMe have been investigated by Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) and Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations. The two simulation techniques employ different force fields, namely the HSEA force field and a CHARMm-based force field. The former shows less conformational flexibility than the latter, in which a multiple energy minima conformational space is sampled. Long-range heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) coupling constants have been measured by selective excitations of the carbons at the glycosidic linkage. Calculated 3J(C,H) values from MMC and LD simulations show excellent agreement to those from NMR experiments. The X-ray crystal structure has a conformation within a region of the conformational space populated in both force fields.

TI  - Dose-related effects of shock waves on rabbit tendo Achillis. A sonographic and histological study.  
AB  - We aimed to determine whether extracorporeal shock waves of varying intensity would damage the intact tendo Achillis and paratenon in a rabbit model. We used 42 female New Zealand white rabbits randomly divided into four groups as follows: group a received 1000 shock-wave impulses of an energy flux density of 0.08 mJ/mm2, group b 1000 impulses of 0.28 mJ/mm2, group c 1000 impulses of 0.60 mJ/mm2, and group d was a control group. Sonographic and histological evaluation showed no changes in group a, and transient swelling of the tendon with a minor inflammatory reaction in group b. Group c had formation of paratendinous fluid with a significant increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the tendon. In this group there were marked histological changes with increased eosin staining, fibrinoid necrosis, fibrosis in the paratenon and infiltration of inflammatory cells. We conclude that there are dose-dependent changes in the tendon and paratenon after extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and that energy flux densities of over 0.28 mJ/mm should not be used clinically in the treatment of tendon disorders.

TI  - Effect of lean growth genotype and dietary amino acid regimen on the lactational performance of sows.  
AB  - The effect of dietary amino acid regimen and genetic capacity for lean tissue growth on the lactational performance of sows was determined in primiparous sows with a high (350 to 390 g/d) or low (240 to 280 g/d) genetic capacity for lean tissue growth from 18 to 110 kg of body weight. During lactation, sows were offered daily 6.5 kg of one of four fortified corn-soybean meal diets containing .58, .77, .96, and 1.15% lysine (L). Litters were standardized to 14 pigs within 8 h after birth. On d 2 of lactation, the high lean growth (LG) sows possessed more proteinaceous tissues and protein and less fat tissue and lipid. During lactation (d 2 to 28 postpartum), high LG sows consumed more feed, mobilized more body protein, and lost less body lipid. Milk, milk energy, and milk lysine yields (pooled across dietary regimens) were similar between genotypes. As daily dietary lysine intakes increased from 27 to 62 g and total digestible lysine supplies (from diet and mobilized tissues) increased from 39 to 68 g, daily yields of milk, milk energy, and milk lysine increased, but the magnitude of the response differed (P < .05) between genotypes, evidently because of differences in the ability of the high and low LG sows to mobilize energy from body tissue. Based on these data, the lactational capacities of high and low LG sows nursing 12 to 14 pigs are similar when similar supplies of lysine and energy are available from dietary intake and mobilized body tissue stores. When supplies of ME do not limit milk synthesis, daily digestible lysine intakes of at least 54 g (> or = 66 g from a corn-soy diet) are needed by these sows nursing litters of 12 to 14 pigs to support milk synthesis and minimize maternal protein losses. This is equivalent to a total digestible lysine need of 4.3 to 4.6 g/kg of milk produced. When ME provided by the diet is less than that needed to fuel maximum milk synthesis, however, the dietary amino acid needs of genetically lean sows may be reduced because of their inability to mobilize sufficient body fat stores.

TI  - Studies on fusobacteria associated with periodontal diseases.  
AB  - The physiological and metabolic characteristics of representative isolates of the various subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum were investigated by growing them in continuous culture in chemically-defined, media. Behaving almost identically, these organisms were found to obtain energy from the fermentation of simple carbohydrates such as glucose or fructose or from the fermentation of certain amino acids, free or in the form of small peptides. The latter can be attacked by aminopeptidase activity which was shown to be essential for the growth of the organism in an environment lacking fermentable carbohydrate and free amino acids but replete with small peptides. This metabolic versatility may explain the presence of F. nucleatum in both supra- and sub-gingival dental plaque and why it is often found together with organisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis which display powerful endopeptidase activities. Using the technique of allozyme electrophoresis, the current subspeciation of F. nucleatum was shown to be of doubtful validity and evidence, based upon physiological and metabolic properties, for differences in pathogenicity between isolates was not detected. While this organism is a member of various bacterial consortia associated with periodontal diseases, its contribution to the disease process remains unclear.

TI  - The elastic rod model for DNA and its application to the tertiary structure of DNA minicircles in mononucleosomes.  
AB  - Explicit solutions to the equations of equilibrium in the theory of the elastic rod model for DNA are employed to develop a procedure for finding the configuration that minimizes the elastic energy of a minicircle in a mononucleosome with specified values of the minicircle size N in base pairs, the extent w of wrapping of DNA about the histone core particle, the helical repeat h(0)b of the bound DNA, and the linking number Lk of the minicircle. The procedure permits a determination of the set Y(N, w, h(0)b) of integral values of Lk for which the minimum energy configuration does not involve self-contact, and graphs of writhe versus w are presented for such values of Lk. For the range of N of interest here, 330 < N < 370, the set Y(N, w, h(0)b) is of primary importance: when Lk is not in Y(N, w, h(0)b), the configurations compatible with Lk have elastic energies high enough to preclude the occurrence of an observable concentration of topoisomer Lk in an equilibrium distribution of topoisomers. Equilibrium distributions of Lk, calculated by setting differences in the free energy of the extranucleosomal loop equal to differences in equilibrium elastic energy, are found to be very close to Gaussian when computed under the assumption that w is fixed, but far from Gaussian when it is assumed that w fluctuates between two values. The theoretical results given suggest a method by which one may calculate DNA-histone binding energies from measured equilibrium distributions of Lk.

TI  - Comparison of glucose and fat as energy sources in peripheral parenteral nutrition in rats.  
AB  - Glucose is usually chosen as the energy source for total parenteral nutrition. However, the optimal glucose:fat ratio for peripheral parenteral nutrition has not been examined sufficiently. We compared glucose:fat ratios in hypocaloric nutrition. Male SD rats were given hypocaloric parenteral nutrition (approx. 190 kcal/kg/d) for 5 d after laparotomy. The hypocaloric solutions used contained 0, 33, 50, 67 or 100% of the non-protein energy in the form of fat. Body weight change, nitrogen balance, organ weights, and hepatic, splenic and plasma biochemistries were assessed. Body weight increase in the 67 and 100% fat groups was significantly greater than that in the 0% fat group. Nitrogen balance was the same in all groups. Hepatic glycogen content was significantly lower in the 100% fat group than that in the 0% fat group. The weight of epididymal fat deposits was significantly lower in the 0% fat group than in the 50 and 67% fat groups. On the other hand, tissue triglyceride content and plasma lipid levels in the 100% fat group were significantly higher than in the 0% fat group, and were also higher than in the control group.

Combinations of glucose and fat as non-protein energy sources were superior to glucose or fat alone for hypocaloric parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Eating patterns and risk of colon cancer [see comments]  
AB  - Colon cancer has been associated with several nutrients and foods. The authors used data from a population-based study conducted in Northern California, Utah, and Minnesota to examine associations between dietary eating patterns and risk of developing colon cancer. Through factor analysis, detailed dietary intake data obtained from 1,993 cases (diagnosed in 1991-1994) and 2,410 controls were grouped into factors that were evaluated for relations with lifestyle characteristics and colon cancer risk. Several dietary patterns emerged. The dietary patterns with the most variation were labeled "Western," "prudent," "high fat/sugar dairy," "substituters," and "drinkers." The "Western" dietary pattern was associated with a higher body mass index and a greater intake of total energy and dietary cholesterol. The "prudent" pattern was associated with higher levels of vigorous leisure time physical activity, smaller body size, and higher intakes of dietary fiber and folate. Persons who had high scores on the "drinker" pattern were also more likely to smoke cigarettes. The "Western" dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in both men and women. The association was strongest among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (for men, odds ratio (OR)=1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-3.15; for women, OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.36) and among men with distal tumors (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.47-3.46). The "prudent" diet was protective, with the strongest associations being observed among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (men: OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92; women: OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.87); associations with this dietary pattern were also strong among persons with proximal tumors (men: OR=0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80; women: OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92). Although "substituters" (people who substituted low fat dairy products for high fat dairy products, margarine for butter, poultry for red meat, and whole grains for refined grains) were at reduced risk of colon cancer, the reduction in risk was not statistically significant. These data support the hypothesis that overall dietary intake pattern is associated with colon cancer, and that the dietary pattern associated with the greatest increase in risk is the one which typifies a Western-style diet.

TI  - Improvement of infraorbital hyperpigmentation following carbon dioxide laser resurfacing.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients who request cutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) laser resurfacing for correction of periorbital rhytides also complain of "dark circles" under their eyes. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted in order to determine the effectiveness of high-energy pulsed CO2 laser treatment in reducing infraorbital hyperpigmentation. RESULTS: Significant lightening of infraorbital hyperpigmentation was observed 9 weeks following CO2 laser resurfacing. Melanin reflectance spectrometry readings did not correlate with clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report of the successful use of a non-pigment-specific laser system for the treatment of infraorbital dark circles. The lack of correlation of melanin spectrometry readings with clinical assessment likely represents an insufficient follow-up time period.

TI  - Acacia gum (Gum Arabic): a nutritional fibre; metabolism and calorific value.  
AB  - Gum Arabic (Acacia gum, INS 414: E414) is extensively used as a food additive, but there is no regulatory or scientific consensus about its calorific value. It is a complex polysaccharide, primarily indigestible to both humans and animals, not degraded in the intestine, but fermented in the colon under the influence of microorganisms. Despite a range of animal studies, there are no usable data for humans which can quantify the utilizable energy of Gum Arabic. Estimates in the literature from animal experiments vary from 0 to 4 kcal/g. After certain allowances are made for the energy losses from volatile and gaseous fermentation products, an upper level of 2 kcal/g for rats has been set. The situation in man is demonstrably different, with greatly reduced amounts of such products, and the need to adapt for varying periods before Gum Arabic is attacked by colonic bacteria. In the absence of an agreed scientific assignment, the FDA in the USA insist upon 4 kcal/g in nutritional labelling, whereas in Europe, no value has been assigned to soluble dietary fibre, such as Gum Arabic. This review argues that based on present scientific knowledge only an arbitrary value can be used for regulatory purposes.

TI  - The Escherichia coli ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins [see comments]  
AB  - The recent completion of the Escherichia coli genome sequence (Blattner et al., 1997) has permitted an analysis of the complement of genomically encoded ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. A total of 79 ABC proteins makes this the largest paralogous family of proteins in E. coli. These 79 proteins include 97 ABC domains (as some proteins include more than one ABC domain) and are components of 69 independent functional systems (as many systems involve more than one ABC domain). The ABC domains are often, but not exclusively, the energy-generating domains of multicomponent membrane-bound transporters. Thus, 57 of the 69 systems are ABC transporters, of which 44 are periplasmic-binding protein-dependent uptake systems and 13 are presumed exporters. The genes encoding these ABC transporters occupy almost 5% of the genome. Of the 12 systems that are not obviously transport related, the function of only one, the excision repair protein UvrA, is known. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the majority of ABC proteins can be assigned to 10 subfamilies. Together with statistical and, importantly, biological evidence, this analysis provides insight into the evolution and function of the ABC proteins.

TI  - Up-regulation of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) mRNA by exercise training and down-regulation of UCP3 by denervation in skeletal muscles.  
AB  - In skeletal muscles, increased utilization of lipids and carbohydrates accompanied with increased energy expenditure has been observed during and after exercise. UCP3, mitochondrial uncoupling protein, is expressed in skeletal muscles. We investigated UCP3 mRNA levels in exercise training mice which increased energy expenditure and in sciatic nerve-denervated mice which decreased energy expenditure. Mice exercised by 2 wk swimming had 14- to 18-fold increases of UCP3 mRNA in skeletal muscles 3 h after the last swimming, but no increases of UCP1 mRNA in BAT and of UCP2 mRNA in WAT. However, 22 h after exercise, UCP3 mRNA increases observed in skeletal muscles 3 h after exercise returned to sedentary levels. Similar transient increases of UCP3 mRNA were observed in 1 wk treadmill running training or a single exercise bout. In denerved gastrocnemius, GLUT4 and UCP3 mRNA decreased by 58 and 45%, respectively. These data indicate that UCP3 may have a role for fine adjustments of energy expenditure and that up-regulation of UCP3 mRNA may be a defense mechanism against extra energy supply to consume extra energy in skeletal muscles.

For a global comprehensive standardisation of the energetic feed evaluation, the metabolisable energy (ME) will have a preference. The principles of an energetic feed evaluation system with ME as parameter are explained according to which the subsystems for all species of animals should be worked out uniformly. The subsystems for the most important farm animals integrate themselves in addition to ME for predicting the energy and food needs of the animal also the net energy (NE) by taking a standard feedstuff to characterise the relative energetic feed value of the feedstuffs for one or more partial performances of the animal species concerned.

TI  - Carboxy-group modification: high-temperature activation of charge-neutralized and charge-reversed beta-glucosidases from Aspergillus niger.  
AB  - Purified beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger NIAB280 was chemically modified by l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodi-imide (EDC) in the presence of glycinamide (GAM) as nucleophile under various conditions to study the role of carboxy groups in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. beta-Glucosidase was inactivated by the binding of one mol of EDC per mol of the enzyme with a second-order rate constant of 4.77 x 10(-2) mM min-1. Glucose, as competitive inhibitor, partly protected the active-site carboxy group against chemical modification, with a Kd of 3.64 mM. The pH dependence of chemical modification by EDC showed that first-order rate constants decreased with increasing pH, indicating that the proton donating group is a carboxy group. The pKa values of the acidic and basic limbs of the native enzyme were 2.9 and 6.5 respectively. beta-Glucosidase was modified by EDC in the presence of GAM and ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (EDAM) as nucleophiles for 60 min. The effects of neutralization (GAM) and reversal (EDAM) of the negative charges of surface carboxy groups on the kinetic properties of the enzyme were also studied. Native beta-glucosidase, GAM and EDAM had Vmax/K(m) values of 0.73, 1.22 and 0.60 respectively at 40 degrees C. Interestingly, the activation energy profiles of native beta-glucosidase (103 and 79 kJ/mol) were biphasic, whereas those of GAM (137, 101 and 30 kJ/mol) and EDAM (285, 100 and 29 kJ/mol) were triphasic, indicating significant activation of modified beta-glucosidases at temperatures higher than 50 degrees C. The pKa values of both the active-site carboxy groups as well as the pH optima of GAM and EDAM were also significantly decreased compared with those of the native beta-glucosidase.

TI  - Pre-treatment energy status of primary rat tumours as the best predictor of response to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in vivo.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Fluorine-19 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F-M RS) studies of the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (FU) in patients at several clinical centres have shown that increased tumour retention of FU is associated with patient response. The mechanism of this increased tumour retention (FU trapping) is unknown. We used a pre-clinical model to investigate whether other MRS-measurable parameters would correlate with the response to FU treatment and, thus, help elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in FU trapping. METHODS: MRS spectra were obtained using a double-tuned (31P/19F) surface coil from 29 N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced primary rat tumours. 31P-MRS spectra were acquired immediately prior to and at 2.5 h post-treatment with a bolus i.p. injection of FU (100 mg/ kg); 19F-MRS spectra were acquired during the intervening 2.5-h period for measurement of the tumour uptake and retention of FU and of its metabolism to the cytotoxic fluoronucleotides (FNuct). From these data, four parameters were measured: tumour pH and energy status (NTP/Pi) before treatment, total FU retention, and FU anabolism to FNuct (expressed as micromoles per gram per 2.5 h). In addition, tumour response was determined at 7 days post-treatment by measurement of the percentage of change in tumour weight and was classified according to standard oncological criteria as follows: progressive (P) for a > or =25% increase, remissive (R) for a > or =50% decrease or stable (S) for values lying between these two. RESULTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for statistical assessment revealed that groups P, S and R were not distinguishable using the MRS parameters; although when S and R were combined as one group of non-progressive disease (NPD; n = 24), both the NTP/Pi ratio and the total FNuct formed were significantly greater (P = 0.04) than those observed in the P group (n = 5). Considering all 29 tumours, linear regression showed that there were positive significant correlations between the NTP/Pi ratio and (a) the percentage of response (P = 0.04), (b) the pre-treatment pH (P = 0.002) and (c) FU retention (P = 0.02), but not FNuct formation (P = 0.66). Unlike results reported in the clinic, the percentage of response and FU retention were neither significantly correlated (P = 0.22) nor associated when groups P and NPD were compared (P = 0.27, Fischer's exact test). FNuct, however, was significantly associated with response, as was the NTP/Pi ratio (P < or = 0.02). Combination of FNuct with the NTP/Pi ratio increased the significance of the association with response (P = 0.003, Fischer's exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in this particular model the pre-treatment tumour NTP/Pi ratio was the best predictor of response to a bolus injection of FU, rather than FNuct formation or FU retention. An elevated NTP/Pi ratio could reflect a well-vascularised tumour with an improved capacity for energy-dependent FU uptake and metabolism to FNuct, suggesting that further investigation of this parameter could be an important line of research, which may aid the identification of tumours likely to be sensitive to FU chemotherapy in the clinic.

TI  - Holmium:YAG lithotripsy efficiency varies with energy density.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We test the hypothesis that holmium:YAG lithotripsy efficiency varies with optical fiber size and energy settings (energy density). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 272, 365, 550 and 940 microm. optical fibers delivered 1 kJ. total holmium:YAG energy to calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi at energy output/pulse of 0.2 to 1.5 J. Stone mass loss was measured for each fiber energy setting. Stone crater width was characterized for single energy pulses. Fiber energy outputs were compared before and after lithotripsy. RESULTS: Stone mass loss correlated inversely with optical fiber diameter (p <0.05). Stone loss correlated with energy/pulse for the 365, 550 and 940 microm. fibers (p <0.001). The 272 and 365 microm. fibers yielded equivalent stone loss at 0.2 and 0.5 J. per pulse. At energies of 1.0 J. per pulse or greater the 272 microm. optical fiber was prone to damage, and yielded reduced energy output and stone loss compared to the 365 microm. fiber (p <0.01). Stone crater width for single pulse energies correlated with energy settings for all fibers (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lithotripsy efficiency with the holmium:YAG laser depends on pulse energy output and diameter of the optical delivery fiber, implying that lithotripsy efficiency correlates with energy density. The 365 microm. fiber is indicated for most lithotripsy applications. The 272 microm. fiber is susceptible to damage and inefficient energy transmission at energies of 1.0 J. per pulse or greater. The 272 microm. fiber is indicated at energies of less than 1.0 J. per pulse for small caliber ureteroscopes or when maximal flexible ureteroscope deflection is required.

TI  - On compensator design for photon beam intensity-modulated conformal therapy.  
AB  - Recently the compensator has been shown to be an in expensive and reliable dose delivery device for photon beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The goal of IMRT compensator design is to produce an optimized primary fluence profile at the patient's surface obtained from the optimization procedure. In this paper some of the problems associated with IMRT compensator design, specifically the beam perturbations caused by the compensator, are discussed. A simple formula is derived to calculate the optimal compensator thickness profile from an optimized primary fluence profile. The change of characteristics of a 6 MV beam caused by the introduction of cerrobend compensators in the beam is investigated using OMEGA Monte Carlo codes. It is found that the compensator significantly changes the energy spectrum and the mean energy of the primary photons at the patient's surface. However, beam hardening does not have as significant an effect on the percent depth dose as it does on the energy spectrum. We conclude that in most situations the beam hardening effect can be ignored during compensator design and dose calculation. The influence of the compensator on the contaminant electron buildup dose is found to be small and independent of the compensator thickness of interest. Therefore, it can be ignored in the compensator design and included as a correction into the final dose distribution. The scattered photons from the compensator are found to have no effect on the surface dose. These photons produce a uniform low fluence distribution at the patient's surface, which is independent of compensator shape. This is also true for very large fields and extremely asymmetric and nonuniform compensator thickness profiles. Compared to the primary photons, the scattered photons have much larger angular spread and similar energy spectrum at the patient's surface. These characteristics allow the compensator thickness profile and the dose distribution to be calculated from the optimized fluence profile of primary photons, without considering the scattered photons.

TI  - Metabolite concentrations in skeletal muscle of different aged rats submitted to hypoxia and pharmacological treatment with nicergoline.  
AB  - The energy metabolism of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in young-adult, mature, and senescent rats was evaluated after 72 h of continuous exposure to normobaric hypoxia or normoxia. The effects of treatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist nicergoline were also investigated. In the gastrocnemius muscle we evaluated the concentrations of some significative metabolites involved in anaerobic glycolysis and the Krebs' cycle, free amino acids related to the Krebs' cycle, ammonia, some energy mediators, and the energy store creatine phosphate. In the soleus muscle a selection of these was evaluated. In both muscles aging was similarly characterized by a decrease in muscular creatine phosphate concentration, while the energy mediators and the energy charge potential remained unchanged. Singly, some gastrocnemius muscle metabolites showed linear changes in their concentrations with aging, while for the soleus muscle the only linear change regarded glucose-6-phosphate. Continuous normobaric hypoxia induced greater changes at the age of 4 and 24 months than at 12 months. Chronic treatment with nicergoline modified the influence of hypoxic conditions on muscle metabolites concentrations only in some cases, regardless of the age of the animals. Further investigations are necessary before any firm conclusions can be drawn about the pharmacological activity of nicergoline on hypoxia in aged rats.

TI  - Retention of NADPH-linked quinone reductase activity in an aldo-keto reductase following mutation of the catalytic tyrosine.  
AB  - Aldo-keto reductases (AKR) are monomeric oxidoreductases that retain a conserved catalytic tetrad (Tyr, Lys, Asp, and His) at their active sites in which the Tyr acts as a general acid-base catalyst. In rat liver 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD, AKR1C9), a well-characterized AKR, the catalytic tyrosine is Tyr 55. This enzyme displays a high catalytic efficiency for a common AKR substrate 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ). Surprisingly, Y55F and Y55S mutants of 3alpha-HSD reduced 9,10-PQ with high kcat values. This is the first report whereby the invariant catalytic tyrosine of an AKR has been mutated with retention of kcat values similar to wild-type enzyme. The Y55F and Y55S mutants displayed narrow substrate specificity and reduced select aromatic quinones and alpha-dicarbonyls. kcat versus pH profiles for steroid oxidoreduction catalyzed by wild-type 3alpha-HSD exhibited a single ionizable group with a pK= 7.0-7.5, which has been assigned to Tyr 55. This group was not evident in the kcat versus pH profiles for 9, 10-PQ reduction catalyzed by either wild-type or the Tyr 55 mutant enzymes, indicating that the protonation state of Tyr 55 is unimportant for 9,10-PQ turnover. Instead, wild-type and the active-site mutants Y55F, Y55S, H117A, D50N, K84R, and K84M showed the presence of a new titratable group with a pKb = 8.3-9.9. Thus, the group being titrated is not part of the tetrad. All the mutants decreased kcat/Km considerably more than they decreased kcat. Thus, the K84R mutant demonstrated a 30-fold decrease in the pH-independent value of kcat but 2200-fold decrease in the pH-independent value of kcat/Km. This suggests that all the tetrad residues influence quinone binding and that Lys 84 plays a dominant role in maintaining proper substrate orientation. Using wild-type enzyme, the energy of activation (Ea) for 9,10-PQ reduction was approximately 11 kcal/mol less than steroid oxidoreduction. The Ea for 9,10-PQ reduction was unchanged in the Tyr 55 mutants, suggesting that the reaction proceeds through the same low-energy barrier in the wild-type enzyme and these mutants. The retention of quinone reductase activity in this AKR in the absence of Tyr 55 with kcat versus pH rate profiles and activation energies identical to wild-type enzyme suggests that quinone reduction occurs via a mechanism that differs from 3-ketosteroid reduction. In this mechanism, the electron donor (NADPH) and acceptor (o-quinone) are bound in close proximity, which permits hydride transfer without formal protonation of the acceptor carbonyl by Tyr 55. This represents a rare example where one enzyme can catalyze the same chemical reaction (carbonyl reduction) by either acid catalysis or by a propinquity effect and where these two mechanisms can be discriminated by site-directed mutagenesis.

TI  - [Tissue oxygenation: physiological and pathophysiologic aspects in intensive care]  
AB  - Continuous oxygen supply to the tissues is one of the many important factors in intensive care. However, as a basic requirement for the structure and function of higher developed organisms energy production by oxydative metabolism is of outstanding importance, because there is no significant storage of energy and anaerobic metabolism is insufficient. The determinants of oxygen supply--blood flow and oxygen content--are well known. The system stands out for its extensive ability to compensate imbalances. Nevertheless one has to bear in mind also rather trivial disturbances like insufficient respiration and hypovolemia. Absolute values of global parameters, however, provide no information on the oxygen supply of individual organs that are variably susceptible to hypoxia. Regional perfusion and tissue respiration are influenced by various factors. Together with systemic components the physiologic oxygen transport along the oxygen cascade follows demand. Regardless of their position on the oxygen cascade malfunctions of oxygenation impair first the function and eventually the structure of the tissues. An utilisation block on the cellular level can prevent sufficient energy production despite optimized oxygen supply, the damage of reperfusion can intensify the effects of hypoxia. Typical haemodynamic patterns follow the tissue hypoxia. For maintaining an equilibrium between oxygen demand and supply it is important that oxygen consumption is also influenced by numerous factors. Only when an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand--an oxygen debt--is realized at an early stage, the critically ill patient can be saved from irreversible damage. In the field of intensive care the frequently latent tissue hypoxia is often a result of the chronic oxygen debt of individual, particularly vulnerable organs. Considering those aspects the intestinal mucosa is particularly suited for the monitoring of tissue oxygenation in the critically ill patient.

TI  - Structural features that modulate the transmembrane migration of a hydrophobic peptide in lipid vesicles.  
AB  - Two approaches employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to investigate the transmembrane migration rate of the C-terminal end of native alamethicin and a more hydrophobic analog called L1. Native alamethicin exhibits a very slow transmembrane migration rate when bound to phosphatidylcholine vesicles, which is no greater than 1 x 10(-4) min(-1). This rate is much slower than expected, based on the hydrophobic partition energies of the amino acid side chains and the backbone of the exposed C-terminal end of alamethicin. The alamethicin analog L1 exhibits crossing rates that are at least 1000 times faster than that of native alamethicin. A comparison of the equilibrium positions of these two peptides shows that L1 sits approximately 3-4 A deeper in the membrane than does native alamethicin (Barranger-Mathys and Cafiso. 1996. Biochemistry. 35:489). The slow rate of alamethicin crossing can be explained if the peptide helix is irregular at its C-terminus and hydrogen bonded to solvent or lipid. We postulate that L1 does not experience as large a barrier to transport because its C-terminus is already buried within the membrane interface. This difference is most easily explained by conformational differences between L1 and alamethicin rather than differences in hydrophobicity. The results obtained here demonstrate that side-chain hydrophobicity alone cannot account for the energy barriers to peptide and protein transport across membranes.

The results obtained here demonstrate that side-chain hydrophobicity alone cannot account for the energy barriers to peptide and protein transport across membranes.

TI  - Laser nerve repair by solid protein band technique. I: identification of optimal laser dose, power, and solder surface area.  
AB  - Thirty-four tibial nerves in 17 adult male wistar rats were repaired by applying protein bands longitudinally across the nerve join. The bands were then irradiated with a fibre-coupled diode laser (lambda = 810 nm). The relations among the laser weld breaking force, the power, and the solder surface area were investigated, while maintaining a consistent ratio between the total mass of protein solder in a band and total laser energy delivered (the laser energy dose). When this laser energy dose was held constant, the average breaking force of the laser welds irradiated by 72 mW laser output power was weaker than that reached after 90 mW laser radiation. There is a linear relation between the solder breaking force and the solder surface area when band thickness, laser power, and laser dose are unvaried.

TI  - [The effect of lactation time on the macronutrient and mineral composition of milk from Venezuelan women]  
AB  - Human milk is considered the ideal food for the infant and it has been extensively used to estimate its nutrient requirements. The objective of this paper was to determine the effect of lactation time on the macronutrient an mineral content of milks obtained from Venezuelan women and also to compare this with the established nutrient requirements of the infant. For this purpose 83 milk samples from 45 low income mothers were analyzed at the colostrum (48 h to 54 d) and mature states of lactation (1.3 and 6 months). The results showed that colostrum had a higher protein and a lower fat content than mature milks whereas its content of energy and carbohydrate was similar to mature milk. The iron and calcium content of the milk remained unchanged during the whole study whereas Zn and Cu decreased and increased with lactation time respectively. In contrast, phosphorous and magnesium increased up to 3rd month of lactation and remained constant there after. The macronutrient content of 850 ml of the analyzed milk almost completely fulfilled the daily infant requirements established in the US (RDA) and Canada (RNI). The mineral content of this volume of milk however was insufficient to cover the infants requirements particularly those established in the US. The most notorious deficiency in these milks was in Fe since they could fulfill only 11% the infants RDA for this mineral. The infant mineral requirements established in Canada are substantially lower than those defined in the US and therefore the analyzed milks could totally fulfill the Canadian infant daily requirements of Mg, Fe and Ca and more than 70% and 80% of the requirements of Zn and P. In general, the results of this study showed that the nutrient content of the analyzed milks agree well with those reported in the literature for women from different parts of the world including developed and underdeveloped areas. At the same time they pointed out the differences in the definition of the infant nutrient requirements set by different countries and also emphasize the fact that human milk, which by definition is the natural source of nutrients for the human infant apparently is incapable of fulfilling its daily requirements.

TI  - Conformational analysis of the 20-residue membrane-bound portion of melittin by conformational space annealing.  
AB  - The conformational space of the 20-residue membrane-bound portion of melittin has been investigated extensively with the conformational space annealing (CSA) method and the ECEPP/3 (Empirical Conformational Energy Program for Peptides) algorithm. Starting from random conformations, the CSA method finds that there are at least five different classes of conformations, within 4 kcal/mol, which have distinct backbone structures. We find that the lowest energy conformation of this peptide from previous investigations is not the global minimum-energy conformation (GMEC); but it belongs to the second lowest energy class of the five classes found here. In four independent runs, one conformation is found repeatedly as the lowest energy conformation of the peptide (two of the four lowest energy conformations are identical; the other two have essentially identical backbone conformations but slightly different side-chain conformations). We propose this conformation, whose energy is lower than that found previously by 1.9 kcal/mol, as the GMEC of the ECEPP/3 force field. The structure of the proposed GMEC is less helical and more compact than the previous one. It appears that the CSA method can find several classes of conformations of a 20-residue peptide starting from random conformations utilizing only its amino acid sequence information. The proposed GMEC has also been found with a modified electrostatically driven Monte Carlo method [D. R. Ripoll, A. Liwo, and H. A. Scheraga (1998) "New Developments of the Electrostatically Driven Monte Carlo Method: Test on the Membrane-Bound Portion of Melittin," Biopolymers, Vol. 46, pp. 117-126].

TI  - Amphiphile induced echinocyte-spheroechinocyte transformation of red blood cell shape.  
AB  - A possible physical explanation of the echinocyte -spheroechinocyte red blood cell (RBC) shape transformation induced by the intercalation of amphiphilic molecules into the outer layer of the RBC plasma membrane bilayer is given. The stable RBC shape is determined by the minimization of the membrane elastic energy, consisting of the bilayer bending energy, the bilayer relative stretching energy and the skeleton shear elastic energy. It is shown that for a given relative cell volume the calculated number of echinocyte spicula increases while their size decreases as the number of the intercalated amphiphilic molecules in the outer layer of the cell membrane bilayer is increased, which is in agreement with experimental observations. Further, it is show that the equilibrium difference between the outer and the inner membrane leaflet areas of the stable RBC shapes increases if the amount of the intercalated amphiphiles is increased, thereby verifying theoretically the original bilayer couple hypothesis of Sheetz and Singer (1974) and Evans (1974).

AB  - 1. A new open-circuit respiration unit consisting of 6 respiration chambers, gas analysis unit and data-acquisition system is briefly described. 2. Energy and protein metabolism in broiler lines selected for improved food efficiency (FC) or for growth rate (GL) were measured weekly from 3 to 6 weeks of age. 3. Gross and apparent metabolisable energy intake per kg W0.75 was on average higher for GL than for FC chickens without differences in metabolisability. Fed and fasted heat production per kg W0.75 did not differ between the lines. FC chickens retained less energy per kg W0.75 than GL chickens. 4. FC chickens deposited much less of the retained energy as fat than their GL counterparts and also showed greater protein conversion efficiency. The leaner composition of the body weight gain in FC chickens was confirmed by the estimated lower fat deposition per kg W0.75 and by the lower fat: protein ratio.

TI  - Biliopancreatic diversion.  
AB  - Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) has made reacceptable the malabsorptive approach to the surgical treatment of obesity. The procedure, in a series of 2241 patients operated on during a 21-year period, caused a mean permanent reduction of about 75% of the initial excess weight. The indefinite weight maintenance appears to be due to the existence of a threshold absorption capacity for fat and starch, and thus energy, and the weight loss is partly due to increased resting energy expenditure. Beneficial effects other than those consequent to weight loss or reduced nutrient absorption included permanent normalization of serum glucose and cholesterol without any medication and on totally free diet in 100% of cases, both phenomena being due to a specific action of the operation. Operative mortality was less than 0.5%. Specific late complications included anemia, less than 5% with adequate iron or folate supplementation (or both); stomal ulcer, reduced to 3.2% by oral H2-blocker prophylaxis; bone demineralization, increasing up to the fourth year and tending to decrease thereafter, with need of calcium and vitamin D supplementation; neurologic complications, totally avoidable by prompt vitamin B administration to patients at risk; protein malnutrition, which was reduced to a minimum of 3% with 1.3% recurrence, in exchange with a smaller weight loss, by adapting the volume of the gastric remnant and the length of the alimentary limb to the patient's individual characteristics. It is concluded that the correct use of BPD, based on the knowledge of its mechanisms of action, can make the procedure an effective, safe one in all hands.

TI  - Putting the shoulder to the wheel: a new biomechanical model for the shoulder girdle.  
AB  - The least successfully modeled joint complex has been the shoulder. In multi-segmented mathematical shoulder models rigid beams (the bones) act as a series of columns or levers to transmit forces or loads to the axial skeleton. Forces passing through the almost frictionless joints must, somehow, always be directed perfectly perpendicular to the joints as only loads directed at right angles to the surfaces could transfer across frictionless joints. Loads transmitted to the axial skeleton would have to pass through the moving ribs or the weak jointed clavicle and then through the ribs. A new model of the shoulder girdle, based on the tension icosahedron described by Buckminster Fuller, is proposed that permits the compression loads passing through the arm and shoulder to be transferred to the axial skeleton through its soft tissues. In this model the scapula 'floats' in the tension network of shoulder girdle muscles just as the hub of the wire wheel is suspended in its tension network of spokes. With this construct inefficient beams and levers are eliminated.  A more energy efficient, load distributing, integrated, hierarchical system is created.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of leptin with food intake and preferences for sugar and fat in obese humans. METHOD: Food intake and preferences for sugar and fat were measured in 35 obese women by a four-day food record and three hedonic tests, respectively. RESULTS: High fasting serum leptin concentration adjusted for body fat mass and dietary underreporting was associated with low dietary energy and fat intakes. In addition, trends towards lower preference for chocolate as well as for the taste of high-fat, low-sugar mixture were observed in those with higher leptin concentration. CONCLUSION: High serum leptin concentration could be associated in obese women with lower dietary energy and fat intakes, and possibly with the lower preference for fat. These findings need to be verified in further human studies.

There is also no doubt that further advances in energy systems, materials, and electronics will provide for smaller and more reliable electrically driven blood pumps, but the present engineering design appears to be adequate to provide devices satisfactory for initial clinical use. Due to problems in the availability of suitable donor hearts, the concept of replacing the natural heart with an artificial heart as a "bridge to transplantation" has gained attention in recent years. The present paper shows technical and clinical aspects of multivariable electrophysiologic neuromonitoring in a patient with an artificial heart assist device in the intensive care unit. The data (EEG, 40 Hz brain oscillations, brainstem auditory- and somatosensory evoked potentials) are discussed with respect to the influence of the artificial heart on their quality and reliability. Reasons for artifacts and problems of interpretation are shown.

TI  - Impact of aging on rat urinary bladder fatigue.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about the fatigability of the urinary bladder. In these experiments, we characterized contractile and bioenergetic changes in bladder fatigue and investigated the impact of aging on these changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole urinary bladders from 3-month-old (n = 17) and 24-month-old (n = 12) SD rats were isolated and individually mounted in organ baths. The bladders were electrostimulated repeatedly (50 volts, 32 Hz, 1 MS; every 2.5 minutes). The pressure generation, rate of pressure generation and the emptying ability (% volume emptied) of the isolated bladders were measured with each stimulation. After the 20th electrostimulation, the bladders were immediately stimulated with 500 microM bethanechol. Upon completion of their series of stimulations, some of the bladders were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue phosphocreatine and ATP content of the frozen bladders and a group (six 3-month-old and six 24-month-old rats) of fresh bladder tissues was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The results can be summarized as follows: (1) Pressure generation, rate of pressure generation and emptying ability were gradually reduced in both young and aged bladders as repeated stimulation proceeded. (2) The final bethanechol stimulation emptied the same intravesical volume as the 20th electrostimulation emptied (in both groups), indicating that bladder fatigue is due to a post-synaptic mechanism. (3) As compared to their own first responses, aged rats exhibited significantly greater rates of reduction in both pressure generation and emptying ability than did young rats. (4) Analysing fresh bladder tissues, the phosphocreatine and ATP concentration of the aged bladders were significantly less than those of the young bladders-13.2 +/- 2.0 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg. protein respectively in the aged bladders vs. 21.2 +/- 1.8 and 7.5 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg. protein respectively in the young bladders. After repeated stimulation, phosphocreatine and ATP concentration were reduced in both groups (1.4 +/- 0.3 and 0.43 +/- 0.1 nmol./mg. protein in the aged bladders, 7.5 +/- 1.4 and 4.1 +/- 0.5 nmol./mg. protein in the young bladders), with a greater degree of reduction in the aged bladders. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that, in response to repeated electrostimulation, aged rat bladders became fatigued faster than young bladders. Decreased capability in energy production might be one contributing factor for faster fatiguability of the aged urinary bladders.

TI  - Dietary protein restriction alters glucose but not protein metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - We determined whether a customary diet high or low in protein (1) influences postabsorptive amino acid catabolism, nitrogen (N) balance, and hepatic glucose output (HGO) in normal subjects or patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or (2) alters blood glucose levels in NIDDM. Eight normal young adults and five obese middle-aged persons with NIDDM consumed low-protein (0.8 g/kg lean body mass [LBM]) or high-protein (3.0 g/kg LBM) diets at maintenance energy for consecutive 7-day periods. Fasting and average blood glucose and N balance were measured daily. The level of dietary protein had no effect on the basal plasma leucine rate of appearance (Ra) or urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion in either subject group. Basal leucine oxidation (and by inference, whole-body amino acid catabolism) was reduced on the low-protein diet but basal HGO was not, and although exogenous glucose effectively suppressed HGO, it did not reduce leucine oxidation with either diet. After adaptation to the low-protein diet, N balance in both the normal and NIDDM subjects was close to zero. The low-protein diet reduced the fasting and daily blood glucose of the diabetic subjects by approximately 2 mmol/L (P < .05). We conclude that physiologic variation in dietary protein does not affect basal whole-body protein turnover or HGO in either normal young adults or obese middle-aged NIDDM subjects. However, protein restriction to the level of the average daily requirement significantly reduces postabsorptive and average daily blood glucose concentrations in persons with NIDDM.

TI  - The effect of Walker-256 tumour development upon Kupffer cell metabolism.  
AB  - The liver plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the cachectic state in rats bearing extra-hepatic tumours. Kupffer cells, which as macrophages, show a strong relationship between metabolism and function could be involved in the alterations observed in the disruption of many functions of the organ as a whole. To assess whether the metabolic/functional pattern of Kupffer cells was altered by cachexia we have investigated the utilization of glucose, glutamine and palmitate by the cells from tumour-bearing and control rats. We have found an enhanced utilization of the three substrates by the cells from tumour-bearing rats as compared with controls, which was related to greater energy production through the Krebs cycle and enhanced production of precursors for the synthesis of the many substances the cells secrete when activated. The use of palmitate as substrate was also augmented in these cells, in the opposition to the observation in stimulated peritoneal macrophages. The availability of palmitate however, was not associated with a reduction of glucose or glutamine consumption. The cycle of interconversion, free fatty acids/triacyglycerol in Kupffer cells from tumour-bearing rats was also found to be increased, as was hydrogen peroxide production. Taken together the results suggest an increased utilization of substrates for both energy production and for synthetic processes (e.g. NADPH for hydrogen peroxide production).

AB  - Carpal fractures in children are uncommon injuries, with the scaphoid being fractured most frequently. Thirty-three children with scaphoid fractures and one child each with fractures of triquetrum, trapezoid, hamate, and capitate were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 13 years, 4 months. The mechanism of injury was of low energy in most cases, with > 80% of injuries involving a fall. Localizing tenderness was present in 100% of cases. Of fractures, 97.3% were evident on the initial radiographs. One patient required a bone scan to confirm the diagnosis. All but one scaphoid fracture went on to union with conservative treatment in a long-arm thumb spica cast or short-arm thumb spica cast at a mean of 7.1 weeks. All other carpal fractures healed at a mean of 4.5 weeks. The one scaphoid nonunion was attributed to noncompliance by the patient.

AB  - High resolution time-frequency analysis of OAE signals evoked by stimuli of different strength was performed by means of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. The method relies on adaptive decomposition of a signal into waveforms of well-defined frequency and time localization.  Energy of OAE as a function of time and frequency was evaluated for stimuli strength of 35-80 dB SPL. Dynamic characteristics of the signal were constructed. For strong stimuli decrease of the power of high frequency components was found. Matching Pursuit proved to be a method which offers high resolution parametrisation of OAE in time-frequency space and provides excellent possibilities of investigation of the signal generation mechanisms.

TI  - Relation between circulating leptin concentrations and appetite during a prolonged, moderate energy deficit in women [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: On the basis of observations in rodents, leptin is thought to play a key role in the regulation of energy expenditure and food intake, but less is known of its influence on ingestive behavior and energy balance in humans. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect in women of a chronic energy deficit on plasma leptin concentrations and self-reported appetite and explored possible relations between leptin and appetite sensations. DESIGN: Twelve healthy women (body mass index, in kg/m2: 23-37) participated in a metabolic ward study in which 3 wk of neutral energy balance was followed by 12 wk of energy deficit (energy intake reduced by 2 MJ/d and energy expenditure increased by 0.8 MJ/d). Body weight and composition were monitored, fasting leptin concentrations were measured 4 times, and feelings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption were monitored hourly throughout the day on 7 selected days. RESULTS: Adiposity-adjusted leptin decreased by 54% after 1 wk of a moderate energy deficit and remained low after 6 and 12 wk. Leptin was associated with self-reported hunger, desire to eat, and prospective consumption (range of r: -0.6 to -0.7, P < 0.01). The greatest hunger increase coincided with the largest percentage drop in circulating leptin and the lowest final leptin concentration. The relation between leptin and hunger was not influenced by amount of weight or body fat loss. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the idea that leptin is a physiologic regulator of hunger during energy deficits in humans; the role of leptin in the long-term regulation of food intake warrants further study.

TI  - Energy balance and thermogenesis in rats consuming nonstarch polysaccharides of various fermentabilities.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The equivalents of dietary protein, fat, and available carbohydrate as fuels for maintenance (kJ apparent metabolizable energy/kJ maintenance requirement) are known from classical experiments and are similar across species; that for nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) is undetermined. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the energy equivalent of NSP and the thermic responses to NSP. DESIGN: In a randomized block design, 120 rats were treated in groups of 10 for 28 d with a basal diet (control) supplemented with starch and 10 different NSP treatments in amounts between 38 and 92 g/kg basal diet. Cellulose and starch were references. Thermic responses, deduced from body-composition changes and modeling of energy disposition, and energy and substrate excretion were determined. RESULTS: NSP had fermentabilities between 0.01 and 0.93 g/g intake. Fermentability, partial digestible energy, and net metabolizable energy values of NSP were closely related. Generally, 51% of apparent metabolizable energy from NSP (fermentable gross energy) met maintenance requirements. Diet (energy)-induced thermogenesis (DIT) was evident from whole diets. Fermentable NSP supplied net metabolizable energy and caused DIT. After DIT and fermentation were accounted for, NSP-induced thermogenesis was generally -2+/-4% (x+/-SEM) of gross NSP energy, except for an outlying pectic preparation, which was 33% (P< 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: The energy equivalent of NSP was 196 (100/51) kJ/kJ, compared with 128, 105, and 100 for protein, fat, and glucose, respectively, from the classical experiments. With the exception of pectic NSP, NSP does not induce thermogenesis in excess of that associated with DIT and fermentation.

TI  - Energy generation in hypertrophied postischemic myocardium. Feasibility of prolonged inotropic stimulation with dopamine in hypertrophied reperfused left ventricles.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-hypertrophied reversibly injured postischemic myocardium can be stimulated for a prolonged period without detrimental effects. Since no data on hypertrophied myocardium are available, our aim was to examine the effects of a prolonged postischemic positive inotropic stimulation on moderately hypertrophied left ventricles. METHODS: Using a Langendorff-type isovolumically contracting isolated heart model, moderately hypertrophied (+50% of ventricular mass) hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated and compared to data from non-hypertrophied hearts of normotensive rats. A 30 minutes noflow ischemia was performed, and in the postischemic period dopamine was continuously administered for 20 minutes in order to stimulate the postischemic hearts to the control level of function. Data were compared to postischemic hearts without stimulation and to non-ischemic controls. After 50 minutes of reperfusion and cessation of the catecholamine steady state function, maximum contractile response, and high energy phosphates were determined. RESULTS: 30 minutes ischemia followed by 50 minutes reperfusion caused a significant reduction in developed LVP to 77.8 +/- 4.2% in SHR. Dp/dtmax was reduced to 67.0 +/- 2.3%. After cessation of dopamine stimulation developed LVP was 64.3 +/- 3.5% and dp/dtmax 69.3 +/- 3.7% in SHR. The double product was identically reduced in all postischemic groups. The contractile reserve was comparable in stimulated and non-stimulated postischemic SHR hearts. In hypertrophied myocardium, ATP was reduced to 1.1 +/- 0.1 mumol/gww (non-ischemic controls 2.5 +/- 0.3 mumol/gww) in unstimulated and to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mumol/gww in stimulated postischemic hearts. Comparably the ischemia-induced reduction in ATP in non-hypertrophied myocardium was 1.3 mumol/gww. Similar results were obtained for ADP and AMP. Creatine phosphate levels were normal in stimulated and non-stimulated postischemic myocardium of hypertrophied and non-hypertrophied hearts. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that prolonged stimulation of stunned hypertrophied myocardium is feasible without detrimental effects on post-stimulation contractile function. The energy generating apparatus is capable to deliver sufficient energy during stimulation of stunned hypertrophied hearts.

TI  - [Determination of beta-hydroxybutyrate in milk using test strips: a new aid for the diagnosis of subclinical and clinical ketosis in the cow]  
AB  - In order to evaluate a dipstick test for the semi-quantitative determination of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in milk, we determined the BHB content in milk samples of healthy and ketotic high yielding dairy cows with the dipsticks. BHB was analysed on an analyser in 39 of these milk samples as well as in 88 blood samples which were drawn when milk samples were obtained. There was a strong correlation between milk BHB values which were determined with the two methods (r = 0.92; BHB quantitative = -9.9 + 1.25 x BHB dipstick value). Although BHB concentration in plasma is much higher than in milk, the correlation between plasma BHB, determined on an analyser, and the dipstick test results in the corresponding milk samples was also quite strong (r = 0.84; plasma BHB in mmol/l = 0.23 + 0.009 x milk BHB in mumol/l, determined with dipsticks). The dipstick test is suitable for the diagnosis of clinical ketosis and for monitoring the energy status of high yielding dairy cows.

TI  -  An energy dispersive X-ray micro-analysis (EDX) interfacial study on a high copper amalgam/polycarboxylate cement combination.  
AB  - The interface between a polycarboxylate cement and a high copper amalgam core containing (21%) tin by weight was analyzed by EDX. It was found that, the tin concentration at the interface was very low (1.26%). On the other hand, a higher copper concentration was demonstrated (6.39%). Mean while a correlation was established between the tin concentration of the amalgam core and the shear bond strength with polycarboxylate cement. Moreover, it could be assumed that, the tin concentration rather than the copper concentration of the amalgam cores has the substantial effect on the shear bond strength between amalgam cores and polycarboxylate cement.
