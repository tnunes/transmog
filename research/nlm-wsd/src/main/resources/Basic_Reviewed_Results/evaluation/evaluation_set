TI  - Management of locally advanced breast cancer.  
AB  - Multimodality therapy--i.e., surgical excision followed by appropriate systemic therapy and radiotherapy--has an established role in managing patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Preoperative chemotherapy permits optimal local control with less radical surgical intervention, although its impact on overall survival is still unclear. Definitive data are not yet available to determine the optimal sequencing of surgery and radiation therapy. Therefore, treatment should continue to be individualized. New cytotoxic agents with demonstrated activity against metastatic breast cancer (e.g., the taxanes) are being studied to determine their role in women with LABC. Preliminary data from a recently completed, small randomized trial in patients with LABC did not demonstrate a significant improvement in overall survival with high-dose chemotherapy plus stem-cell rescue, as compared with standard-dose therapy.  The evaluation of biologic parameters that may predict response and survival, and of radiographic and pathologic methods to assess response, should ultimately lead to significant improvements in the management and survival of patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

TI  -  Evaluation of a medical diagnosis system using simulator test scenarios.  
AB  - This paper describes an informal but systematic method for how to test and verify a knowledge-based system in a large open-ended medical target domain. The system used is Guardian, an intelligent system for monitoring and diagnosis of post-cardiac surgery patients in an intensive-care unit. The knowledge base is tested and verified by running the system on a series of realistic test scenarios, both with an embedded simulator and with an external simulation system. The same scenarios are presented to human test subjects, making it possible to compare and analyze the performance of the knowledge-based system with that of human physicians. The use of simulators instead of clinical data also means that it is possible to test crucial scenarios which occur seldom in medical practice. Our results show that a system like Guardian might indeed be useful in medical care.

AB  - Helical computed tomography (CT) represents a significant technical improvement over conventional (incremental) CT. This noninvasive imaging technique is now routinely used in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. This paper focuses on the topics of CT technique (scanning parameters, use of intravenous contrast media, use of oral contrast media and spasmolytic agents, calculation of reformatted and projective images), as well as on the CT appearance of pancreatic carcinoma and the differential diagnosis and staging. A short comparison with other methods is included.

TI  - Urinary tract infections in children. Epidemiology, evaluation, and management.  
AB  - Accurate documentation of UTIs in children is essential for proper evaluation and management. Urine cultures with multiple organisms or colony counts less than 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/ml should be considered suspect and require confirmation, particularly with clean-catch specimens. Children with well-documented UTIs should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5 days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with known VUR. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying voiding dysfunction and constipation is an essential component of the successful management of UTIs in children.

TI  - Comparison of intracranial computed tomographic (CT) findings in pediatric abusive and accidental head trauma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Child abuse specialists rely heavily on diagnostic neuroimaging. OBJECTIVES: Study objectives were: (1) to compare the frequencies of six specific intracranial CT abnormalities in accidental and non-accidental pediatric head trauma, and (2) to assess interobserver agreement regarding these CT findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three pediatric radiologists blindly and independently reviewed cranial CT scans of pediatric patients who sustained closed head trauma between 1991 and 1994. All patients were less than 4 years of age. Study cases included thirty-nine (50 %) with non-accidental head trauma and thirty-nine (50 %) with accidental head trauma. Each scan was evaluated for the presence or absence of the following six intracranial findings: (1) interhemispheric falx hemorrhage, (2) subdural hemorrhage, (3) large (non-acute) extra-axial fluid, (4) basal ganglia edema, (5) posterior fossa hemorrhage, and (6) frontal-parietal shearing tear(s). Interobserver agreement was calculated as the percentage of total cases in which all reviewers agreed a specific CT finding was present or absent. Diagnosis required independent agreement by all three pediatric radiologists. The frequencies of these six intracranial CT abnormalities were compared between the two study groups by Chi-square analysis and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement between radiologists was greater than 80 % for all lesions evaluated, with the exception of frontal-parietal shearing tear(s). Interhemispheric falx hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, large (non-acute) extra-axial fluid, and basal ganglia edema were discovered significantly more frequently in non-accidental trauma (P &lt;/= .05). CONCLUSION: Although not specific for child abuse, discovery of these intracranial CT abnormalities in young patients should prompt careful evaluation of family and injury circumstances for indicators of non-accidental trauma.

TI  -  Evaluation of recurrent thrombosis and hypercoagulability [see comments]  
AB  - The primary mechanisms for coagulation were described more than a century ago. However, inherited disorders of coagulation have been recognized for only a few decades. Activated protein C resistance and other related protein defects account for many cases of hypercoagulability. Primary care physicians can initiate testing in individuals for whom there is a high degree of suspicion. Testing for specific disorders is best performed before initiation of anticoagulant therapy. Management often includes long-term warfarin therapy following initial anticoagulation with heparin.

TI  - Comparison of patterns of pulmonary venous blood flow in the functional single ventricle heart after operative aortopulmonary shunt versus superior cavopulmonary shunt.  
AB  - In this study we investigated the patterns of pulmonary venous flow in children with functional single ventricles to obtain a better understanding of the determinants of transpulmonary blood flow. Sixty-eight patients with functional single ventricles and aortopulmonary shunt (n = 34, group I), or superior cavopulmonary connection (n = 34, group II) underwent transesophageal Doppler echocardiographic assessment of flow in the left upper pulmonary vein before undergoing the next stage of surgery. Twelve patients from group II also underwent simultaneous evaluation of superior vena caval flow. Biphasic forward pulmonary venous flow was noted in 62 patients in sinus rhythm (S wave in systole, D wave in diastole); in 6 patients with junctional rhythm, significant early systolic reversal of flow was present. Both the S- and D-wave velocity-time integrals (VTI) were greater in group I than in group II (S(VTI) 9.9 +/- 4.2 vs 8.0 +/- 2.6, p = 0.02; D(VTI) 8.0 +/- 3.5 vs 4.2 +/- 2.6, p <0.001). In both groups, pulmonary venous flow was predominantly systolic; however, the proportion of flow during ventricular systole was significantly greater in group II than in group I (S(VTI)/D(VTI) group II: 2.4 +/- 1.5; group I 1.4 +/- 0.5, p = 0.001; percent systolic fraction of pulmonary venous flow group II = 67%, group I = 56%, p <0.001). Analysis of superior vena caval flow in group II revealed a single predominant wave with onset at early systole and peak in late systole at a mean of 150 ms after the pulmonary venous S-wave peak. Our data suggest that ventricular systole (i.e., atrial relaxation, atrioventricular valve descent) asserts great influence on transpulmonary blood flow in the functional single ventricle.

The efficiency of microbiological tests was measured by the following criteria: recovery, sensitivity and specificity. The results analysed by the Kendall concordance coefficients demonstrated that the rapid method appeared more effective even if poorly specific.

TI  - Low levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are associated with a poor prognosis in human breast carcinoma.  
AB  - It has been suggested that angiogenesis and angiogenic factors may be strong predictors of relapse in patients with breast carcinoma. We measured the levels of the angiogenic peptide basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 140 breast tumour cytosols using an immunoassay. There were no significant differences in bFGF levels between breast non-malignant lesions and primary carcinomas. In 124 cases with primary breast cancer, we observed an association of low bFGF levels (< 400 pg mg[-1]) with increasing tumour size (P = 0.023) and stage of disease (P = 0.002). bFGF levels did not correlate with other variables, including axillary nodes, hormone receptors, cathepsin D and the serum tumour markers CA15.3 and CEA. With a median follow-up of 44.0 months, breast cancer patients with low levels of bFGF had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) than patients with elevated bFGF (log-rank, P < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of DFS, only bFGF, T-stage and histological grade showed statistical significance. In a parallel evaluation of circulating bFGF, we did not observe a correlation between the serum and tissue bFGF levels in the 29 selected cases with matched determinations. Our results indicate that low bFGF levels in breast carcinoma are an independent prognostic indicator of poor prognosis and disease recurrence.

TI  -  A prospective evaluation of the diagnostic work-up before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: A prerequisite for successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the exclusion of potential risks such as cholangiolithiasis or anatomical malformations. As there is no general agreement regarding the appropriate preoperative diagnostic work-up, a comparative study of different diagnostic methods was carried out. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 180 consecutive patients admitted to a community hospital for cholecystectomy due to symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, a prospective comparison was carried out of the diagnostic accuracy of patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, intravenous cholangiography, ultrasonography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Measurement of the diameter of the common bile duct was found to be a reliable method as a single noninvasive parameter for diagnosing cholangiolithiasis (sensitivity 100%, specificity 93%), with good predictive power (positive predictive value 0.7, negative predictive value 1.0). The best accuracy achieved noninvasively and without sonography was with a combination of positive patient history and gamma-glutamyl transferase findings (sensitivity 58%, specificity 84%, positive predictive value 0.37, negative predictive value 0.93). ERCP detected additional cholangiolithiasis in 19 of 139 patients (13.7%) and anatomical malformations in three patients. In all 19 patients, the bile ducts were cleared of stones endoscopically within 24 hours, prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Among the 163 patients primarily assigned to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the protocol diagnostic work-up, including ERCP, allocated three patients (1.8%) to open surgery. Conversion from laparoscopic cholecystectomy to open cholecystectomy occurred in a further two of 158 patients (1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that routine ultrasonography prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be recommended in order to determine the diameter of the common bile duct. In patients with a ductal diameter of more than 6 mm, ERCP should be performed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be carried out within 24 hours after ERCP and papillotomy.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, characterized by synovial inflammation and local tissue destruction. For many years, the traditional approach for the therapy of RA was the therapeutic pyramid. Recently, the beneficial effects of the pyramid strategy have been questioned because the long-term outcome of RA continues to be disappointing. Three developments stimulated a change in thinking: first, the increasingly precise understanding of pathogenesis, second, the availability of biological agents and, third, the methods of evaluation for RA therapy. Therefore, many treatment strategies for RA, almost of which prefer the earlier introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, have been proposed. Several representative strategies are reviewed in this paper.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the relation between leak point pressure (LPP) at first urodynamic evaluation and the status of the upper urinary tract (UUT) and renal reflux (RR). METHODS: The study comprised 45 myelodysplastic children, one week to 13 years of age; 19 (42%) were less than one year old. LPP was measured when liquid started to come out through the urethral meatus, around the 5-6 Fr catheter. UUT was evaluated by ultrasound and RR by voiding cystography. RESULTS: 19 children had LPP < 30 cm H2O; all cases had a normal UUT, although 5 (26%) had RR. Twenty-six cases (58%) had LPP > 30 cm H2O; 12 (46%) had abnormal UUT and 6 of these had RR; 7 cases had RR but normal UUT. The group with LPP > or = 30 cm H2O was analyzed according to LPP values. The UUT was abnormal in 31% of cases with LPP 30-60 cm H2O and 37% had RR; UUT was abnormal in 70% of cases with LPP > 60 cm H2O and 70% had RR. Of the 19 patients less than one year old 9 (47%) had LPP < 30 cm H2O, no patient had abnormal UUT and only two (22%) had RR; 10 cases had LPP > or = 30 cm H2O, 6 of these had abnormal UUT and 5 had RR. CONCLUSIONS: In this study UUT was normal when LPP was < 30 cm H2O. Renal impairment and RR increased with LPP. Urethral functional obstruction carries a worse prognosis of pediatric neurogenic bladder. In these cases clean intermittent catheterization is recommended, regardless of patient age and sex.

TI  - Education and other measures of socioeconomic status and risk of incident Alzheimer disease in a defined population of older persons.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relations of 3 measures of socioeconomic status (education, occupational prestige, and income) to risk of incident clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Cohort study with an average observation of 4.3 years. SETTING: East Boston, Mass. a geographically defined community. PARTICIPANTS: A stratified random sample of 642 community residents 65 years of age and older who were free of AD at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical diagnosis of probable AD according to standard criteria, using structured uniform evaluation. RESULTS: The relations of the 3 measures of socioeconomic status to risk of disease were assessed using logistic regression analyses. In individual analyses, fewer years of formal schooling, lower income, and lower occupational status each predicted risk of incident AD; risk of disease decreased by approximately 17% for each year of education. In an analysis including all 3 measures, the effect of education on risk for disease remained approximately the same, but the effects of the other 2 measures were somewhat less and did not attain formal statistical significance, compared with separate analysis of each measure. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of lower socioeconomic status predict risk of developing incident AD. The mechanism of this relation is uncertain, but the possibility that it reflects unidentified and potentially reversible risk factors for the disease deserves careful investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fine needle biopsy (FNB) in children has been slow to gain acceptance compared with the use of the technique in adults where it is regarded as standard clinical practice in screening significant lymphadenopathy and suspicious masses. We report our early experience with FNB in the paediatric population. METHODS: Fifty-two biopsies were performed between June 1991 and June 1993. The age of the children ranged from 6 months to 14 years (median 2 years, mean 5 years). RESULTS: A definite diagnosis on cytology alone was obtained in 67%. The pathologist was certain of malignant or nonmalignant potential in 79% (67% benign and 12% malignant) and unsure in 21% (17% benign and 4% malignant). There were no false positive or false negative diagnoses of malignancy. Surgical excision or biopsy was performed in 33%. Fine needle biopsy assisted in planning surgery in 12%. Surgery was necessary for a definite diagnosis in 21% and FNB assisted 42% of the patients to avoid surgery altogether. CONCLUSIONS: Fine needle biopsy is simple, minimally invasive and useful in the evaluation of children with suspicious lymph nodes and masses.

The aim of this study was to confirm and to compare these clinical data with measurements of the bone resistance of the sphenoid and ethmoid walls and to point out regions that have increased bony fragility. Critical dynamometric evaluation of the resistance to breakage of these bony structures was made on 21 anatomic specimens. This study allowed the authors to localization of surgical complications, to demonstrate that other regions renowned for their fragility can be relatively robust, and to point out that robust sites can be dangerously fragile as a result of individual morphological variations. Results from this study provide a supplement to the guidelines for novice surgeons to use in identifying dangerous areas.

TI  - Field evaluation of a combination of monospecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for type-specific diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 infections in HIV-seropositive persons in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.  
AB  - Serologic distinction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 infection is made difficult because of the cross-reactivity and high cost of existing differentiation assays.  An evaluation of a strategy based on a combination of monospecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (CME), was carried out in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are present, to determine its accuracy and cost-effectiveness. A total of 1,608 (428 HIV-1-positive, 361 HIV-2-positive, 371 dually HIV-1 and HIV-2 [HIV-D] reactive, and 448 HIV-negative) sera that had been serotyped by a line immunoassay (Peptilav) were tested retrospectively by an HIV-1-monospecific (Wellcozyme HIV Recombinant ELISA) and an HIV-2-monospecific (ICE*-HIV-2) assay. The CME strategy gave concordant results for all of the 428 sera scored as HIV-1 by Peptilav. Of the 361 sera scored as HIV-2 by Peptilav, 316 (87.5%) were scored as HIV-2 by CME; the remaining 45 sera were positive by both monospecific ELISAs (mean optical density ratios, 1.36 for Wellcozyme and 11.30 for ICE*-HIV-2) and were classified as HIV-D by CME. Of the 371 sera classified as HIV-D by Peptilav, 344 (92.7%), 21, and 6 were scored as HIV-D, HIV-1, and HIV-2, respectively, by CME. Additional testing of the discrepant samples by two HIV differentiation assays (RIBA and INNO-LIA) gave results that agreed with those by CME for most of the sera. In addition, 267 other sera were tested prospectively by both CME and Peptilav. In the prospective evaluation, CME results agreed with those by Peptilav for all 106 HIV-1 sera and 40 of the 41 HIV-2 sera. However, of the 120 sera scored as HIV-D by Peptilav, 69 (57.5%), 47 (39.2%), and 4 (3.3%) were scored as HIV-D, HIV-1 only, and HIV-2 only, respectively, by CME. All 47 samples scored as HIV-1 by CME and two of four HIV-2 sera gave concordant results by RIBA, whereas 29 of 47 sera scored as HIV-1 by CME and all four HIV-2 sera gave concordant results by INNO-LIA. The reagent cost for the CME strategy was 59% lower than the cost of the Peptilav strategy. These results suggest that a combination of highly sensitive and specific commercially available monospecific ELISAs is a reliable and cost-effective strategy for type-specific serodiagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in HIV-seropositive persons and therefore represents a recommended strategy in areas where both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are endemic.

TI  - Application of tissue Doppler imaging technique in evaluating early ventricular contraction associated with accessory atrioventricular pathways in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.  
AB  - To examine the feasibility of a tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) technique for evaluating the early contraction sites in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, we analyzed the time-sequential changes in ventricular wall motion in WPW syndrome by TDI. Fifty patients with WPW syndrome were examined by the TDI system in which the high-speed scanning technique allowed for a frame rate up to 38 frames/sec. Among 42 patients in whom the acceptable images were obtained by TDI, the early contraction, which was represented by a red or blue spot appearing on the subendocardial side at the time of the delta wave in the electrocardiogram, was demonstrated in 25 of 29 patients with left-sided accessory pathways. However, in 13 patients with right-sided pathways, the early contraction sites could be identified in only five patients. The TDI-determined early contraction sites were well coincided with the sites of the accessory pathways determined by the electrophysiologic examination (p < 0.01). After the successful radiofrequency catheter ablation, early contraction sites were found to disappear by TDI in all patients. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the TDI technique to evaluate the early ventricular contraction associated with the atrioventricular accessory pathways. We suggest that the TDI system is helpful to localize the accessory pathways and to evaluate the results after radiofrequency ablation, although further studies are necessary to demonstrate the advantage of TDI over conventional echocardiography and electrophysiologic study in the evaluation of the accessory pathways in WPW syndrome.

TI  -  Retrospective evaluation of cardiopulmonary and acid-base variables during long-term balanced anesthesia for experimental surgery in dogs.  
AB  - Cardiopulmonary and acid-base variables recorded during long-term balanced anesthesia lasting between 12.5 and 16.9 h were evaluated retrospectively in 15 healthy foxhounds that underwent experimental bulla osteotomy with implantation of hearing aids. After premedication with propionylpromazine (0.11 +/- 0.02 mg/kg of body weight) and L-methadone (0.71 +/- 0.06 mg/kg) intravenously (i.v.) and induction with pentobarbital sodium (6.02 +/- 0.83 mg/kg i.v.), anesthesia was maintained with halothane (end-tidal concentration; ETHAL: 0.4 to 1.5%) in nitrous oxide (2 L/min) and oxygen (1 L/min). Because of positional changes from sternal to right lateral recumbency after presurgical brain stem electric response audiometry and differences in duration of surgery, data obtained between 4 (baseline) and 14 h after induction of anesthesia were analyzed. Arterial (PaO2) and alveolar (PAO2) O2 tensions, arterial-to-alveolar O2 tension ratio (PaO2/PAO2), and arterial O2 content (CaO2) remained relatively stable throughout anesthesia. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) was significantly increased above baseline (39, 33 to 46 mm Hg [median, range]) between 7 (39.8, 36.5 to 48.9 mm Hg) and 9 (42, 37.5 to 49.5 mm Hg) h after induction. Because changes in PaCO2 were accompanied by significant increases in body temperature from baseline (36.3, 34.6 to 37.4 degrees C) between 8 (37.1, 35 to 38 degrees C) and 11 (37.6, 35.3 to 38.1 degrees C) h after anesthesia induction as well as by slight increases in arterial blood pressure, the PaCO2 increase may have been caused by increase in metabolic CO2 production and enhanced drainage of CO2 from the tissues into systemic circulation. Furthermore, mild metabolic acidosis (pHa: 7.31, 7.26 to 7.38; HCO3-: 18.9, 16.7 to 21.8 mEq/L; base deficit [BD]: -6.3, -8.5 to -3.4 mEq/L) already existed at 4 h after induction and was related in part to tissue hypoperfusion. Small increases in pHa during the course of anesthesia were accompanied by significant increases in HCO3- concentration and significant decreases in BD between 5 and 10 h after induction. Minor circumscribed swelling of the dependent triceps or masseter muscle was noticed on the first postoperative day in two dogs, and marked tissue swelling with hematoma formation at the medial side of one hind limb was noticed in a third dog. All dogs recovered completely and were submitted to follow-up studies. The anesthetic protocol and extent of monitoring used were adequate to provide safe long-term anesthesia for an experimental surgical procedure with a 100% survival rate and uneventful recovery in most of the dogs.

TI  - [Silent myocardial ischemia and nitrates]  
AB  - Silent ischaemia (SI), generally identifiable as a transient abnormality of ECG, not accompanied by angina or equivalent clinical symptoms, is a common finding in patients suffering from coronary heart disease before and after myocardial infarction, or after surgical coronary revascularization or angioplasty. SI per se is considered to be a serious independent cardiovascular risk factor. From a pathophysiological point of view, SI is intimately related to myocardial oxygen imbalance, in which the demand, both at rest and during effort, exceeds the supply, essentially due to coronary arteriosclerosis or arterial spasm, or both, alongside other neuroendocrine and clotting factors which contribute to the final clinical picture. The absence of large-scale prospective studies prevents a rigorous assessment of whether the currently available anti-ischaemic treatments modify the cardiovascular prognosis related to the presence of SI. Long-acting nitrates, as well as beta-blockers and type L calcium channel blockers exert a beneficial effect on the total ischaemic load, improving not only the clinical profile of angina patients and their exercise tolerance, but also, in most published series, considerably decreasing the number of silent ischaemic events. Today's medical challenge therefore consists of determining whether the reduction of SI by means of anti-ischaemic drugs is accompanied by a proportional reduction of overall morbidity and mortality attributable to this process. As the asymptomatic nature of this type of ischaemia prevents evaluation on the basis of clinical data, it specialized analyses are necessary, such as stress ECG, Holter monitor, TEP, or Thallium 201 myocardial scan, and especially prognostic follow-up, in order to establish the real efficacy of drugs therapy. Coronary videoangiography and the various myocardial revascularization techniques can be applied when the ischaemia cannot be controlled clinically, and when a significant reduction of total ischaemic load is not obtained. In situations of pre-infarction ischaemia, some studies show that the use of nitrate vasodilators reduces the total ischaemic load, improving the clinical course of the disease and significantly reducing the total number of silent ischaemic episodes, although their secondary preventive action remains to be demonstrated. The anti-ischaemic action is more obvious for events triggered by physical effort (ergometry) than for those observed during Holter monitoring, which confirms that multiple mechanisms are responsible for inducing ischaemia and that circadian variability also depends on many factors, which is why the choice of an anti-ischaemic drug must be based on a thorough knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms which induce ischaemia and the anatomical and functional setting in which it develops. It has been clearly shown that nitrate vasodilators not only exert a beneficial action in terms of the control of painful or silent ischaemic events, but that they are also useful as coadjuvant therapy in the presence of signs of ischaemic ventricular dysfunction.

TI  - Mass spectrometric methods for evaluating point mutations.  
AB  - Two methods for internally calibrating spectra resulting from the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis of partially digested proteins are described. Partial digestion of proteins results in a large number of ion signals present in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, which in turn represent a significant over-sampling of each amino acid present in the analyte. This over-sampling allows ion signals of undisputed origin to be used as internal calibrants for the evaluation of fragments suspected to contain point mutations. Correlated with the correct amino acid sequence, the mass values of all ion signals (calibrants and analytes) are observed to fall into a single low-error data set. Conversely, empirically derived data applied to an incorrect sequence split the data into subsets of different errors. The methods take advantage of the self-consistent nature of data generated during the enzymatic mass mapping of proteins using MALDI-TOF, and they aid in the rapid, sensitive and accurate evaluation of point mutations present in proteins.

AB  - An assessment was undertaken in the emergency department of a busy tertiary care center to illustrate the role of continuous quality improvement in the evaluation of an emergency triage program that utilizes the emergency medical attendant to provide triage. An evaluation team interviewed triage staff, charge nurses, internal customers, risk management, and the patient representative. A detailed review of staff job descriptions, organization charts, orientation manual, and physical facilities was conducted. A chart audit was completed on 100 triage notes. Direct observation was undertaken on nine occasions.  An evaluation of the data gathered was performed using the tools of continuous quality improvement, and resulted in specific recommendations being made to improve the process of care. It was concluded that emergency medical attendants function very well in an emergency medicine triage system and the tools of continuous quality improvement can be applied to a clinical service to improve the quality of care.

TI  - 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography as a new approach to detect lymphomatous bone marrow.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Bone marrow involvement in patients with malignant lymphoma is considered a sign of generalized disease with less favorable prognosis. Bone marrow biopsy (BMB), which represents the standard diagnostic procedure, however, is associated with a high rate of false-negative findings, which may lead to errors in management. The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) as a new method to evaluate bone marrow involvement in patients with malignant lymphoma. METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive, untreated patients with either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; n = 39) or Hodgkin's disease (HD; n = 39) were prospectively evaluated. Static FDG-PET imaging was performed following application of 270 MBq (F-18)-FDG. Attenuation correction was performed in 63 of 78 patients.  Visual evaluation was performed by two examiners unaware of the clinical data. Material for BMB (70 bilateral, 8 unilateral) was obtained from the posterior iliac crest. Discordant results of PET and biopsy were settled, when possible, on the basis of further biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: In addition to seven concordant positive and 57 concordant negative findings, biopsy revealed another four cases with bone marrow involvement not detectable by FDG-PET analysis (+5.1%). On the contrary, PET showed bone marrow areas of intensive FDG uptake that suggested bone marrow lymphoma in 10 patients with negative biopsies (+12.8%). In eight patients, FDG-PET findings were confirmed by either histologic verification (n = 4), MRI (n = 2), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rearranged immunoglobulin H sequences (n = 1), or clinical presentation (n = 1). Two cases remained unresolved. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that FDG-PET has a high potential to detect bone marrow involvement in malignant lymphoma. Besides confirming lesions found at BMB, FDG-PET provided additional information, which, in eight of 78 patients (10.3%), led to an upgrade of the tumor stage.

TI  - Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients who are at least forty years old. A long-term follow-up and outcome study.  
AB  - The long-term results were reviewed for seventy-two patients (seventy-five knees) who had had a bone-patellar ligament-bone intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament between August 1984 and May 1992. The mean age of the patients at the time of the operation was forty-five years (range, forty to sixty years). Three patients had a bilateral procedure. The primary mechanisms of injury were accidents that occurred during skiing (thirty-two knees), tennis (fourteen knees), and soccer (five knees). We analyzed the responses to subjective questionnaires, the functional results, and the objective clinical data. The clinical examination included assessment of the range of motion, performance of Lachman and pivot-shift tests, and measurements with use of a KT-1000 arthrometer. All knees were evaluated with use of three common rating scales: that of Lysholm and Gillquist; that of The Hospital for Special Surgery, as modified by Insall et al.; and the International Knee Ligament Standard Evaluation Form. At the latest follow-up evaluation, at a mean of fifty-five months (range, twenty-six to 117 months), three patients reported pain or swelling. No patient reported giving-way or symptoms related to the patellofemoral joint. The mean range of extension was -12 to 6 degrees, compared with -8 to 42 degrees preoperatively, and the mean range of flexion was 112 to 150 degrees, compared with 52 to 154 degrees preoperatively. Flexion was limited to 112 degrees in one patient, but this was 5 degrees greater than that of the uninvolved knee. Sixty knees (80 per cent) had a negative pivot-shift test, and ten knees (13 per cent) had a grade of 1+. On testing with the KT-1000 device at maximum manual pressure, the mean difference between the injured and uninjured knees was found to have improved by 5.1 millimeters, from 6.4 millimeters preoperatively to 1.4 millimeters postoperatively (p < 0.01). The grade on the International Knee Ligament Standard Evaluation Form improved markedly; seventy-two knees (96 per cent) had a grade of C or D preoperatively, whereas seventy knees (93 per cent) had a grade of A or B postoperatively. The Hospital for Special Surgery score improved from a mean of 69 points preoperatively to a mean of 92 points postoperatively (p < 0.01). The mean score according to the scale of Lysholm and Gillquist increased from a mean of 63 points preoperatively to a mean of 94 points postoperatively (p < 0.01). All patients indicated that they were pleased with the result of the procedure. Bicycling was resumed at a mean of four months; jogging, at a mean of nine months; skiing, at a mean of ten months; and tennis, at a mean of twelve months.

TI  - Expert consensus in solo voice performance evaluation.  
AB  - Experts were interviewed to identify criteria for evaluation of vocal performance. A scale was then constructed and inter- and intrajudge reliability assessed. Experts listened to 19 different performances, plus 6 presented a second time. Interjudge reliability for one judge was modest, but increased dramatically as the size of the judge panel increased. The most reliable items were overall score and intonation accuracy. Diction was less reliable than other items. Intrajudge reliability was higher for overall score than for any other item. A factor analysis on the test items yielded factors labelled intrinsic quality, execution, and diction. Another factor analysis, using the experts as variables, revealed two underlying evaluative dimensions. It was found that 13 experts were primarily influenced by execution, and that 8 were mainly affected by intrinsic quality. Interjudge and intrajudge reliabilities of these two groups differed.

TI  - Titration streptomycin therapy in Meniere's disease: long-term results.  
AB  - As soon as the use of streptomycin was started for the treatment of tuberculosis, its ototoxic effect was discovered. Initial reports demonstrated that streptomycin was successful in reducing vestibular responses while preserving cochlear activity. Streptomycin sulfate has been used for almost half a century for the treatment of vertigo in patients with Meniere's disease. At the Gruppo Otologico, Piacenza, Italy, between 1987 and 1995 we treated 16 patients with either bilateral Meniere's disease or with Meniere's disease in their only hearing ear, adopting the titration streptomycin therapy protocol of Graham et al. Three patients with follow-up periods of less than 2 years were not included in this study. The ages of the patients ranged from 36 to 64 years with a mean of 49.2 years. The patients were observed for 2 to 8.8 years. The dose of administered streptomycin varied from 14 to 49 gm. Episodic vertigo was totally relieved in all of the patients after initial treatment, whereas hearing remained the same or was improved when compared with the pretreatment levels. Five of the patients experienced recurring vertigo during a period of 4 to 24 months after initial treatment. Oscillopsia persisted in two patients and ataxia in darkness persisted in another two patients. Hearing was unchanged in 14 ears, improved in 2 ears, and worsened in 4 ears at the last follow-up evaluation. The overall outcome indicated that intramuscular titration streptomycin therapy seems to be one of the most important therapeutic options in the treatment of disabling vertigo in patients with either bilateral Meniere's disease or Meniere's disease in an only hearing ear.

TI  - HELP apheresis in the treatment of sepsis.  
AB  - Heparin induced extracorporeal lipoprotein fibrinogen precipitation (HELP) is an established procedure for removal of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), and fibrinogen in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. In vitro studies revealed that HELP also removes endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP). With the intention to treat, we applied this procedure to 4 patients with severe gram-negative sepsis with highly elevated endotoxin blood levels. Nine treatments were performed, 6 using the standard HELP precipitating buffer and 3 without addition of heparin to the precipitating buffer. Heparin was omitted from the precipitating buffer to avoid fibrinogen depletion in patients at risk (low fibrinogen, postoperative). The average processed plasma volume was 3,386 ml in the standard and 2,963 ml in the modified treatment. Mean reductions (%) in plasma solute concentrations were (standard/ modified procedure) as follows: endotoxin, 50/57; TNF-alpha, 25/5; CRP, 49/55; fibrinogen, 49/6; total cholesterol, 38/5; and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), 41/2. Both treatment modalities were equally effective in removing endotoxin and CRP. With the modified precipitation buffer, fibrinogen was not removed. To further simplify the extracorporeal treatment, we have designed a closed-loop circuit with 2 adsorbers in series, one for removal of TNF-alpha (dextran sulfate modified cellulose) and the other for removal of endotoxin (DEAE-cellulose).  In vitro evaluation confirmed very efficient endotoxin and TNF-alpha removal from plasma. This system is very simple, operates at physiological pH, and uses adsorbers already in clinical use for other purposes.

TI  - Enhancing awareness of hospice through physician assisted living: public health perspectives.  
AB  - The provision, management, and financing of care for patients with irreversible diseases has become increasingly complex in this era of advanced medical technology. With enhanced capabilities of medicine to prolong life, clinical practice has taken on legal and ethical dimensions that reach beyond the traditional scope of medicine. This paper demonstrates that hospice represents a major area of public health practice and research. It argues for enhanced involvement of public health practitioners and academics in the design and evaluation of efforts to encourage appropriate use of hospice for patients with irreversible diseases. The physician assisted living intervention in Connecticut represents one such effort. However, ongoing educational efforts targeted at both the public and health care providers are needed to ensure that all those with irreversible diseases fully understand and have access to hospice care at the end of life.

TI  - A comparison of the in vivo and in vitro response of rat embryos to 5-fluorouracil.  
AB  - This study serves to further define the capabilities of the whole embryo culture system using the well-known teratogen, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an antineoplastic agent. An initial in vivo study was performed whereby pregnant rats were injected intraperitoneally with 10-30 mg/kg 5-FU on day 9 of gestation. On day 20 of gestation, the effects of this drug on the growth and development of embryos were evaluated. The number of externally malformed fetuses increased in a dose-related manner, and the most common defect was micro-/anophthalmos in fetuses of dams treated with 5-FU. Growth retardation was also noted in the 5-FU treated groups. An in vitro study was performed in which drug concentrations were varied (0.15-0.30 microg/ml). Externally abnormal embryos were observed in whole embryo culture system from embryonic day 9 to 11. The most common defect was hypoplastic optic vesicles. In the whole embryo culture system, crown-rump length, somite number, protein contents, and morphological score were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. Finally, histological evaluation and observation of the pattern of cell death of the optic vesicle of 11-day-old embryos in in vivo and in vitro were performed. These parameters revealed no differences in response between in vivo and in vitro embryos treated with 5-FU, suggesting that the whole embryo culture system was an appropriate model for developmental toxicity studies of 5-FU.

All lesions were classified by both methods on a five-point scale as benign or malignant, and the results were correlated to histopathology. Conventional mammography and dynamic MRI yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 82 and 64 %, and 92 and 76 %, respectively. The difference between the results was statistically not significant (p > 0.05) with areas under the receiver-operating-characteristics curves of 0.807 for mammography and 0.906 for MR imaging. Combination of the results of both methods slightly increased the sensitivity for detection of breast cancer to 95 % but decreased specificity to 52 %. In this selected patient subset, including only patients referred for excisional biopsy, contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI proved more sensitive and specific than conventional mammography regarding the detection of malignancy. While a combination of both methods yields a slightly improved sensitivity, specificity is vastly reduced.

TI  -  Evaluation of coronary flow velocity dynamics and flow reserve in patients with Kawasaki disease by means of a Doppler guide wire.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the pathophysiologic effects of the coronary sequelae of Kawasaki disease on coronary hemodynamic variables, we regionally evaluated the flow velocity dynamics and flow reserve in coronary vessels with lesions using an intracoronary Doppler flow guide wire. BACKGROUND: The pathophysiologic effects of the coronary sequelae of Kawasaki disease on coronary hemodynamic variables have not been completely clarified, and we previously reported some discrepancies between coronary angiographic findings and exercise stress tests in Kawasaki disease. METHODS: Doppler phasic coronary flow velocity was determined using an 0.018-in. (0.046-cm) intracoronary Doppler flow guide wire at rest and during the adenosine triphosphate-induced hyperemic response in 95 patients (75 male, 20 female, mean age 9.8+/-6.2 years) with Kawasaki disease. RESULTS: In 25 patients with coronary aneurysms in 29 vessels, the average peak velocity and diastolic to systolic velocity ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the moderate-sized and large-sized aneurysms. Significantly lower values in coronary flow reserve (CFR) were noted in 3 of 10 vessels with moderate aneurysms and in 4 of 7 vessels with large aneurysms. A significant positive correlation (y = 0.53x + 14.6, r2 = 0.91) was observed between the percent diameter stenosis evaluated by angiography and that calculated from the flow velocity measurement. However, the percent diameter stenosis calculated from the flow velocity measurement was underestimated compared with that determined by angiography in the stenotic lesions of intermediate severity. A reduced CFR was noted in five of seven vessels with intermediate stenosis ranging from 50% to 75%, and also in three vessels with mild stenosis ranging from 30% to 40%. A reduced CFR was also observed in six of the eight angiographically normal vessels associated with the area of reduced perfusion on exercise thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in flow dynamics and a reduction in flow reserve were revealed in coronary aneurysms of intermediate to large size and in stenotic lesions, even of mild to intermediate severity, in patients with Kawasaki disease. Abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation, as well as epicardial lesions, contribute to the pathophysiologic responses in Kawasaki disease.

TI  - Intravenous and intra-arterial oxygen-15-labeled water and fluorine-18-labeled fluorouracil in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma.  
AB  - Intra-arterial chemotherapy can potentially increase drug delivery at the tumor sites and has therefore been used for the therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: Dynamic PET and [18F]fluorouracil (18F-FU) were used in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer to examine the pharmacokinetics of the drug up to 120 min after intravenous and intra-arterial injection of the same dose of fluorouracil (FU). All patients included in the study (n = 15) had surgically implanted catheters in the gastroduodenal artery. Dynamic PET studies (up to 5 min) with 15O-labeled water were performed for the evaluation of the access to the lesions immediately before the 18F-FU study using both administration routes. The final evaluation included 24 metastases, obtained from 15 patients. RESULTS: Of 24 lesions, 21 (87.5%) showed an improved access using the intra-arterial approach, and 20 (83.3%) demonstrated a better FU influx after intra-arterial 18F-FU infusion. Metastases reached the highest 18F-FU concentrations after intra-arterial administration, with a maximum standardized uptake values of 18.75 for the FU influx and of 5.03 for FU trapping. Of 24 metastases, eight (33.3%) demonstrated enhanced FU trapping after the intra-arterial administration. Cluster analysis revealed a group of metastases (n = 6) with a nonperfusion-dependent FU transport using the intravenous application. Of these six lesions, five (83.3%) did not show any enhancement of the 18F-FU trapping after intra-arterial application. The data gave evidence for at least one different, energy-dependent transport system, which can be saturated even after intravenous administration of the drug. CONCLUSION: The data show that the main limiting factor for a therapy response is the very high and rapid elimination of the cytostatic agent out of the tumor cells. Furthermore, it was not possible to predict the pharmacokinetics of FU after intra-arterial application using an intravenous PET study. It may be possible, using intravenous PET double-tracer studies, to identify metastases having a nonperfusion-dependent transport system and exclude them from an intra-arterial treatment protocol.

TI  - Persistent low immunization coverage among inner-city preschool children despite access to free vaccine.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare vaccination coverage among children 19 to 35 months of age from public housing developments where a free vaccine outreach program was in place with children residing elsewhere in the city. DESIGN: A household survey using a multistage cluster sampling method to compare community areas which accounted for 80% of measles cases during 1989 (high-risk stratum), areas which accounted for the remaining 20% of cases (low-risk stratum), and public housing developments (public housing stratum) having free, on-site vaccination services. SETTING: Inner-city Chicago households, April to May 1994. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Antigen-specific and series-specific coverage based on written records. RESULTS: Based on evaluation of 1244 children, citywide coverage for four doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, and one dose of measles-containing vaccine (4:3:1) was 47% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40% to 55%]. Coverage was significantly lower among children residing in public housing (23%; 95% CI, 18% to 28%) compared with those residing in high-risk strata (45%; 95% CI, 38% to 52%) and low-risk strata (51%; 95% CI, 43% to 60%). Compared with white children (53%), coverage for the 4:3:1 series was lower among African-American children in public housing (29%) or outside public housing (36%). Moreover, 11% (95% CI, 8% to 14%) of children residing in public housing had never received any immunizations. CONCLUSIONS: African-American children throughout Chicago, particularly in public housing, remain at increased risk for vaccine-preventable diseases and should be targeted further for vaccination services. Vaccination coverage remains low several years after a major outbreak of measles and implementation of a free vaccine outreach program. Cluster surveys may be useful for monitoring vaccination coverage in high-risk urban settings.

TI  - Developing and gaining acceptance for patient care protocols.  
AB  - The purpose of developing protocols and guidelines is greater than reducing variation in practice. The process also creates new paradigms and changes the culture in which health care is delivered. The protocol itself is designed to be transient. The new environment and perceptions of how to improve health care in the future, along with new relationships and processes to accomplish this, are the real power of learning to develop and implement protocols and guidelines. Framing the process of protocol development, therefore, is more important than the resulting document. In developing protocols, attention to changing the thinking and practice of the front-line practitioners, establishing new relationships, and devising new methods of delivering and improving care is key. The process of developing protocols should include all practitioners. They should remain in control of patient care using new methods that allow: a) the monitoring of process and outcomes, b) identification of problems, and c) the evaluation and validation of the effectiveness of implemented change. Evidence from the literature of strategies for protocol development and implementation which are effective in creating change are reviewed, and an example of a known effective method which improves practice is given.

TI  - The child advocacy team in legal actions.  
AB  - This paper provides a general description of child advocacy teams, which are formed in difficult child custody or abuse and neglect cases. They are created when a judge asks that a team assist in determining the child's psychological status and developmental needs, assessing parenting capacities, developing a treatment plan, and monitoring the family's progress. The team consists of representatives from the legal, social service, mental health, and educational systems. The author describes the principles and techniques of child advocacy, characteristics of the professional systems involved, and phases of the team's operation, such as the planning conference, the therapeutic-evaluation process, team meetings, report preparation, and courtroom participation. Outcomes of 77 cases handled by a University of Wisconsin child advocacy team over the past 20 years are presented to show that a team is an effective means of integrating professional and volunteer activities for a family during a child protection or divorce action.

TI  - Carcinoma meningitis secondary to non-small cell lung cancer: combined modality therapy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are increasingly diagnosed as anticancer therapies become more effective and result in prolonged patient survival. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate survival, cause of death, and treatment-related toxic effects in patients undergoing combined modality therapy for LM of non-small cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients (age range, 48-73 years; median, 57 years) with LM attributable to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer were treated prospectively. Neurologic presentation included headache (11 patients), cranial neuropathies (9), ataxia (5), cauda equina syndrome (3), myelopathy (3), meningismus (2), radiculopathy (2), and confusion (1). All patients underwent radiographic evaluation to determine the extent of central nervous system disease followed by radiotherapy (16 patients) and sequential and intraventricular chemotherapy (methotrexate in 32 patients; cytarabine in 16; and thiotepa in 6). Twelve patients received concurrent systemic chemotherapy. RESULTS: Central nervous system imaging demonstrated interrupted cerebrospinal fluid flow (13 patients), parenchymal brain metastases (9), subarachnoid nodules (8), hydrocephalus (5), and epidural spinal cord compression (2). Cytological responses were seen in 17 patients to first-line chemotherapy, 8 to second-line chemotherapy, and 2 to third-line chemotherapy. Treatment-related toxic effects included 20 patients with aseptic meningitis (grade 2 in 16; grade 3 in 4) and 12 patients with grade 3 or 5 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia (4 related to intraventricular chemotherapy). Median survival was 5 months (range, 1-12 months). Nineteen patients died of progressive LM or combined LM and systemic disease progression. Patients with persistent interruption of cerebrospinal fluid flow fared worse than patients with normal cerebrospinal fluid flow (median survival, 4 vs 6 months; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Leptomeningeal metastases in patients with non-small cell lung cancer may be palliated with combined modality therapy; however, therapy and survival is based on the extent of central nervous system disease present at pretreatment evaluation.

TI  - Evidence into practice, experimentation and quasi experimentation: are the methods up to the task?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methodological review of evaluations of interventions intended to help health professionals provide more effective and efficient health care, motivated by the current experience of NHS Research and Development in England. Emphasis upon the forms of research appropriate to different stages in the development and evaluation of interventions, the use of experimental and quasi experimental designs, the methods used in systematic reviews and meta analyses. METHOD: A proposed development process is derived from that used in the development of drugs. The strengths and weaknesses of different experimental and quasi experimental designs are derived from published methodological literature and first principles. Examples are drawn from the literature. RESULTS: Like pharmaceuticals, implementation interventions need to go through several stages of development before they are evaluated in designed experiments. Where there are practical reasons that make random allocation impossible in quantitative evaluations, quasi experimental methods may provide useful information, although these studies are open to bias. It is rare for a single study to provide a complete answer to important questions, and systematic reviews of all available studies should be undertaken. Meta analytic techniques go some way towards countering the low power of many existing studies, reduce the risk of bias, and avoid the subjective approaches that may be found in narrative reviews. CONCLUSIONS: The initiative taken by NHS Research and Development in examining methods to promote the uptake of research findings is welcome, but will only prove helpful if careful attention is paid to the different stages of the development process, and different research approaches are used appropriately at different stages.

TI  -  An in vitro evaluation of the strength of an internal conical interface compared to a butt joint interface in implant design.  
AB  - Dental implants are subject to large and highly complex loads of varying magnitude, duration and vector. Bridge performance is closely related to load transmission both at the bone to implant interface and between components within the implant-abutment-bridge cylinder complex. The design of the interface between components within this complex may have a profound influence on the long term function of the implant supported prosthesis. An in vitro evaluation of implants 3.5 mm in diameter, utilizing an internal conical interface has demonstrated increased resistance to bending moments at the fixture-abutment interface (P = 0.00010) and at the abutment-bridge cylinder interface (P < 0.01), when compared to a standard 3.75 mm implant with a hex mediated, butt joint interface. The relatively small values for coefficient of variance measured in both systems would confirm that whilst the size of data is small, it is nonetheless a reliable indication of the relative strength of these implant designs.

TI  - Safety of intrahippocampal depth electrodes for presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Intracerebral depth electrodes are used in preoperative evaluation of selected patients with intractable epilepsies. In spite of their usefulness, safety of depth electrodes is disputed, and the number of insertions is decreasing. This study examined retrospectively possible deleterious effects such as perioperative complications, induction of epileptogenesis, and neuropsychologic deficits. METHODS: Clinical course and neuroradiologic findings of 115 patients with bilaterally inserted longitudinal intrahippocampal depth electrodes (IDEs) were analyzed. Hippocampal resection specimens were examined histopathologically. To detect newly developed epileptogenic areas, EEG recordings, seizure control, and semiology after standardized resection procedures were compared between patients who received IDEs and those who did not. To demonstrate functional deficits caused by IDE insertion into an unaffected hippocampus of the speech-dominant hemisphere, changes of verbal learning and memory performances before and after right amygdalohippocampectomy were compared between patients evaluated with and without IDEs. RESULTS: Five significant complications without any permanent neurologic deficit were noted, and only one was specifically linked to IDE insertion. The tissue damage associated with the insertion was minimal and sharply circumscribed. No differences of seizure outcome after standardized resections were identified between patients with and without IDEs. In postoperative EEG recordings, there was no evidence of new epileptogenic areas. No verbal memory deficit caused by IDE implantation into the hippocampus of the speech-dominant hemisphere was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that it is safe to implant these IDEs in selected patients.

TI  -  [Clinical evaluation of RT-PCR method for detection of HCV-RNA: second report availability of RT-PCR system using PCR internal control for detection of HCV-RNA and the influence of interfering substances on the detection]  
AB  - The COBAS Amplicor system is an automated diagnostic PCR system which contains a PCR internal control (P. I. C.) template to monitor the amplification. The applicability of COBAS Amplicor HCV was examined using sera of patients with hepatitis. Furthermore, the effects of possible interfering substance (total protein, triglyceride, hemoglobin, glucose, total bilirubin, heparin, lysis reagent including guanidium) on HCV-RNA detection were investigated. The sensitivity of COBAS Amplicor HCV was equivalent to the manual method of Amplicor HCV, moreover all of the results in 54 clinical samples analyzed on both COBAS Amplicor HCV and Amplicor HCV were in agreement. Detection sensitivity of HCV-RNA decreased in the presence of total bilirubin and heparin. Ten and 25mg/dl of total bilirubin affected HCV-RNA detection but did not affect P. I. C. This result suggested that total bilirubin interfered with the protein denature caused by the lysis reagent. Fifteen U/ml of heparin in the sample completely inhibited amplification both of the HCV-RNA and P. I. C. One U/ml of heparin did not affect amplification, but heparinized blood samples should not be used for the detection of HCV-RNA. To examine the effect of possible carry over contamination on the lysis reagent which contains guanidium, various concentrations of lysis reagent in P. I. C. were tested. RT-PCR was inhibited by 1/500 volume contamination of lysis reagent in specimen diluent. Other substances did not affect the sensitivity. Our results indicate that the carryover contamination of lysis reagent cause more "false negative" results than interfering substances in sera. In conclusion, HCV-RNA detection system containing P. I. C., such as COBAS Amplicor HCV, will become a very useful to differentiate "false negative" and "true negative" result.

TI  -  Evaluation of the role of Carnobacterium piscicola in spoilage of vacuum- and modified-atmosphere-packed cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C.  
AB  - The microflora on spoiled cold-smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and CO2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. The shelf-life of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the microflora was composed of LAB (10(6)-10(7) cfu/g) with an associate Gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g). The addition of nisin and/or a CO2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of LAB to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g, respectively. CO2-atmosphere +/- nisin inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages. The Gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp., resembling V. marinus, Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila. Irrespective of the addition of nisin and/or CO2-atmosphere, the LAB microflora was dominated by Carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of the 255 LAB isolates characterized. Whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE confirmed the Carnobacterium species identification. The spoilage potential of C. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx. 10(6) cfu/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C. The salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or CO2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu/g) of C. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. This was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of LAB and Gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Sarcoidosis in coroner's autopsies: a critical evaluation of diagnosis and prevalence from Cuyahoga County, Ohio [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: During a histologic study of sarcoidosis in tissues made available from the Cuyahoga County Coroner's autopsy files, the prevalence of this disorder seemed much greater than generally reported. Aims were to evaluate this impression and if confirmed, to explore underlying reasons, including reliability of diagnoses and possible overestimates as well as possible associations with particular population subgroups. METHODS: Cases were retrieved by computer search of diagnoses coded over the past 7 years. Extent of organ involvement was documented and relevant microscope slides reviewed, with consideration of diagnostic criteria generally proposed. Clinical information, occupational risk and evidence for illicit drug use were evaluated. Acceptable cases were categorized by gender, race and age. Crude and standardized prevalences were calculated and related to 1990 US Census figures for the County. RESULTS: On review of 9324 adult autopsies performed for medico-legal reasons, 31 were judged to have sarcoidosis. Standardized prevalence was 320 +/- 72/10(5). Among population subgroups statistically significant differences were not established. However, crude prevalences suggested that females, blacks and younger persons were more likely to have sarcoidosis than males, whites and older subjects, with ratios of 1.6 to 1; 4.7 to 1; and 2.5 to 1, respectively. Overall prevalence was some 10 times greater than indicated from State-wide death certificates. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoidosis as found in cases autopsied at the/Coroner's Office, Cuyahoga County, is much more prevalent than generally reported. It is an under-appreciated cause of sudden unexpected death. Young black females appear to be most affected, and worthy of further investigation.

TI  - Both Na+-K+ ATPase and Na +-H+ exchanger are immediately active upon post-ischemic reperfusion in isolated rat hearts.  
AB  - Limited time resolution has hampered proper evaluation of changes in intracellular Na+ (Na+i) in whole hearts upon post-ischemic reperfusion. In isolated rat hearts perfused at 37 degrees C, we studied the contribution of the Na+-K+ ATPase and the Na+-H+ exchanger to control of Na+i during reperfusion using 23Na NMR and the shift reagent Tm(DOTP)5- with a time resolution of 5 s. To assess activities of the Na +-K+ ATPase and the Na+-H+ exchanger, 250 micro mol/l ouabain and/or 3 micro mol/l EIPA, respectively, was added to the perfusate during the first 5 min of reperfusion, following 20 min of ischemia. When used, ouabain was also present for 2 min prior to ischemia. Na+i increased during ouabain perfusion prior to ischemia (132+/-5 and 133+/-4% of the pre-ischemic control value after 2 min, in ouabain and ouabain+EIPA hearts, respectively; mean+/-s.e.m.; n=6 per group) resulting in higher end-ischemic values in ouabain and ouabain+EIPA hearts (249+/-9 and 267+/-17% of the pre-ischemic control value, respectively) than in control and EIPA hearts (207+/-21 and 199+/-10% of the pre-ischemic control value, respectively). In ouabain, hearts Na+i started to rise directly upon reperfusion and amounted to 117+/-6% of the end-ischemic value after 60 s of reperfusion. In control hearts, however, Na+i dropped immediately and was 87+/-5% of the end-ischemic value after 60 s, indicating that the Na+-K+ ATPase resumed function directly upon reperfusion. The initial steep increase of Na+i upon reperfusion in ouabain hearts, which diminished after approximately 40 s to the rate of increase observed during ischemia, was absent in ouabain + EIPA hearts. This indicates the existence, although masked by Na+-K+ ATPase activity, of a Na+-H + exchange mediated Na+ influx upon reperfusion. If only EIPA was present during reperfusion the initial decrease in Na+i was faster than in control hearts, corroborating this finding.Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - The multi-centre assessment of quality of life: the Interdisciplinary Group for Cancer Care Evaluation (GIVIO) experience in Italy.  
AB  - One of the main issues to be considered in conducting clinical trials concerns the presence of missing data. This aspect is particularly relevant in oncology longitudinal studies, characterized by a long follow-up, and especially in quality of life studies where there is still little knowledge about patients' characteristics that predict loss of data. Since the middle of the 1980s the GIVIO (Interdisciplinary Group for Cancer Care Evaluation) co-operative group has been involved in conducting quality of life assessment studies, also focusing on the development of some strategies aimed at the minimization of missing data. In this paper we report on the results of two trials, which are now completed, concerning the quality of life assessment in a sample of breast and colon cancer patients. In order to cope with the problem of missing data, in both the trials the strategy of follow-up mailing was adopted, which proved to be an effective way to increase the response rate by nearly 50 per cent at each time point.

TI  - Primary eosinophilic esophagitis in children: successful treatment with oral corticosteroids [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The histologic appearance of esophageal eosinophils has been correlated with esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease in children. Esophageal eosinophilia that persists despite traditional antireflux therapy may not represent treatment failure, but instead may portray early eosinophilic gastroenteritis or allergic esophagitis. In this study, a series of pediatric patients with severe esophageal eosinophilia who were unresponsive to aggressive antireflux therapy were examined and their clinical and histologic response to oral corticosteroid therapy assessed. METHODS: Of 1809 patients evaluated prospectively over 2.5 years for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, 20 had persistent symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia, despite aggressive therapy with omeprazole and cisapride. These patients were treated with 1.5 mg/kg oral methylprednisolone per day, divided into twice-daily doses for 4 weeks. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and histologic evaluation before and after treatment. RESULTS: Histologic findings in examination of specimens obtained in pretreatment esophageal biopsies in children with primary eosinophilic esophagitis indicated significantly greater eosinophilia (34.2+/-9.6 eosinophils/high-power field [HPF]) compared with that in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease who responded to medical therapy (2.26+/-1.16 eosinophils/HPF; p < 0.001). After corticosteroid therapy, all but one patient with primary eosinophilic esophagitis had dramatic clinical improvement, supported by histologic examination (1.5 +/-0.9 eosinophils/HPF, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients in a series with marked esophageal eosinophilia and chronic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease unresponsive to aggressive medical antire-flux therapy had both clinical and histologic improvement after oral corticosteroid therapy.

TI  - Progressive sensorineural hearing impairment in systemic vasculitides.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A large series of patients with various forms of systemic vasculitis were evaluated to analyze the prevalence of progressive sensorineural hearing loss (PSNHL), its characteristics and evolution, and the effects of different therapies. METHODS: A total of 673 patients were questioned about the presence of subjective audiovestibular disturbances. Of those, 80 subjects complained of subjective audiological disturbances and underwent oto-rhino-laryngological and audiovestibular evaluation. Those patients with progressive hearing impairment were selected and studied carefully. RESULTS: A PSNHL was observed in 14 patients. The hearing loss was bilateral and asymmetrical in most subjects. It was usually sensorineural, with a cochlear lesion. Unsteadiness was the most frequent vestibular symptom and canal paresis or palsy was noted in most patients. Systemic corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide were useful treatments; in unresponsive patients, satisfactory results were obtained with methotrexate and plasma exchange. CONCLUSIONS: PSNHL is a rare complication of systemic vasculitis, but occasionally is one of the presenting symptoms. Its clinical evolution is variable, but timely clinical assessment and treatment can positively affect prognosis.

TI  - [Use of metal stents in gastroenterology]  
AB  - A variety of metal stents have been increasingly used for malignant esophageal, biliary and colorectal stenoses. Esophageal self-expandable stents significantly reduce the early morbidity after implantation compared to conventional plastic prostheses. However they offer no benefit in the long-term due to various late complications. Biliary stents offer a significantly longer patency than plastic devices. This advantage is however clinically relevant only for patients with a survival time of more than three months. Preliminary trials indicate promising results for palliation of colorectal stenoses with metal stents in selected cases. Due to a lack of comparative studies the different types of metal stents must be selected on basis of their physical characteristics and clinical experiences. Most of the prostheses are irremovable which is a limitation for use in benign stenoses of the gastrointestinal and biliary tract. In addition metal stents are extremely expensive so that carefully designed trials are warranted for evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio.

TI  -  Clinical evaluation of the Physio annuloplasty ring.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prospective evaluation of a selectively flexible annuloplasty ring was undertaken to assess its safety and efficacy. PATIENTS: Between December 1992 and November 1996, 190 patients with mitral regurgitation underwent mitral valve repair using an annuloplasty ring (Carpentier-Edwards Physio; Baxter-Edwards CVS Laboratories; Irvine, Calif). Ninety-four were in New York Heart Association class I or II. Etiology was degenerative in 74% of the patients. RESULTS: Four patients died early for a hospital mortality of 2.1%, and one late death occurred. Two patients with systolic anterior motion required early valve replacement. Two transient episodes of hemiparesis occurred during the first postoperative month. There were no late thromboembolic complications, no late reoperation, and no endocarditis. Mean follow up of 23+/-13 months was complete in 99% of the patients. Seventy-seven patients (40.5%) have had Doppler echocardiography > 1 year after surgery: 61 (80%) of them have no residual regurgitation, 15 have grade 1+/4+ mitral regurgitation, while 1 has grade 2+/4+ insufficiency. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (mL/lm2) decreased from 107.4+/-35.5 preoperatively to 74.2+/-24.4 at last control (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The physio annuloplasty ring provided reliable and stable results at medium-term follow-up with a very low incidence of valve-related complications.

TI  - Unplanned first contact as a predictor of future intensive use of mental health services.  
AB  - The scheduled appointment system, widely used in most mental health services, has never been evaluated. This study attempts such an evaluation within a community-based mental health service that permits unplanned access to specialist care, by comparing further service use of first-episode patients who come unannounced to seek psychiatric care with that of patients with a planned (scheduled) initial appointment. All patients with first lifetime psychiatric contact who contacted psychiatric services reporting to the South-Verona Psychiatric Case Register between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 1989 (n = 1261) were identified. A total of 1056 patients entered the study and were followed for 2 years. Poisson regression with the generalised estimating equation (GEE) method (to take into account both overdispersion of contacts between subjects and correlation between contacts within subjects) was used to evaluate the effects of the type of first-ever contact (defined as planned or unplanned according to whether or not a regular appointment was previously arranged) and of other selected variables, including sociodemographic characteristics, on the annual rate of planned and unplanned care in the follow-up period. Thirty-six percent of first-ever contacts were unplanned. Patients who began with unplanned contact, as compared with others, were more often widowed, separated or divorced, unemployed and with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or organic psychosis. Moreover, they had, in the following 2 years, significantly higher rates of both unplanned and planned community care, as well as more in-patient care (higher admission rate and a longer mean length of stay). These results at follow-up were confirmed when the rates for the type of first-ever contact were adjusted for all other clinical and sociodemographic variables at initial contact. Step-down Poisson multiple regression analysis showed that the rates of both unplanned and planned contacts in the follow-up period were significantly and independently associated with: type of first-ever contact, diagnosis and type of service first contacted. Unplanned cases at initial contact require particular attention and are confirmed as at risk for placing higher demands on mental health services in the following 2 years. The results of the present study may also have implications for other, non-psychiatric health services.

TI  - Photosensitizing potencies of the structural analogues of benzoporphyrin derivative in different biological test systems.  
AB  - Benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) is a potent photosensitizer in biological systems. There are four structural analogues of BPD. The analogues share the same chromophor, which results in their having almost identical optical spectra, extinction coefficients, and yields of singlet oxygen. Small structural differences affect their photosensitizing potency in various biological systems, and thus make them an interesting tool to study the structure-activity relationship. The ranking of the photosensitizing potency of the analogues differed depending on the test system. The more efficient photosensitization of tumor cell lines by the highly lipophilic monoacids as compared to that by less lipophilic diacids correlated positively with the partition coefficient, and was related to the rate of diffusion into the cells. However, in the assay systems where PDT targets were located in the membrane (red blood cells hemolysis, enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus, isolated mitochondria) there was very little difference in photosensitizing potency of BPD analogues. The results indicate that the evaluation of photosensitizers is affected by the test system and thus for photosensitizers screening purposes, the choice of the test system should be made based on the intended ultimate use.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139.  
AB  - A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was developed for concurrent detection of rfb sequences specific for the O1 and the O139 serogroups of Vibrio cholerae and for ctxA specific sequences. The multiplex PCR assay was found to be highly specific and sensitive and was capable of detecting 65 cfu and 200 cfu per assay of V. cholerae O1 and O139, respectively. Evaluation of the multiplex PCR assay using 121 stool samples from patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Calcutta, showed the assay to be 100% sensitive and 95.2% specific when the culture method was taken as the standard. In addition to the 38 PCR positive stool samples, an additional four samples which were negative by culture method but positive by PCR assay belonged to the O139 serogroup. All the 38 stool samples positive for either O1 or O139 serogroup by PCR assay were also positive for the ctxA amplicon indicating that the O1 and O139 V. cholerae strains have the genetic potential of producing cholera toxin.

TI  - 4-Hexylresorcinol as inhibitor of shrimp melanosis: efficacy and residues studies; evaluation of possible toxic effect in a human intestinal in vitro model (Caco-2); preliminary safety assessment.  
AB  - Studies were performed on the efficacy, residues and in vitro enterocyte toxicity of 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR), which could be utilized as an inhibitor of shrimp melanosis (black spot). Mediterranean sea shrimp (Parapaeneus longirostris) were treated with solutions of 4-HR in sea-water, at three different concentrations, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg of shrimp, to test its antioxidative property. As a comparison a group of shrimp was treated with sodium metabisulphite (1 g/kg), while another group was left untreated. 4-HR showed a marked ability to inhibit or slow down melanosis (black spot) in shrimp; the most effective concentration was 100 mg/kg within an optimum period of 7 days but with effects up to the tenth day. During the first 5 days, 4-HR residues in the edible part of the shrimp showed a fast decrease in all three groups, going from initial average values of 20 mg/kg at 0 time, to 0.9 in the group treated at 25 mg/kg; from 42 to 1.8 mg/kg in the group at 50 mg/kg and from 85 to 1.9 mg/kg in the group at 100 mg/kg. In vitro studies on enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells did not indicate any cytotoxic effect up to a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Moreover, no inhibition of protein synthesis was observed, which lends further support to the absence of significant damage to the intestinal mucosa induced by 4-HR. The available database on 4-HR pharmacology and toxicology is inadequate to determine even a provisional ADI. There is negative evidence of carcinogenesis and no significant untoward effects were observed in humans when it was used as an anthelmintic. However, it is not possible to determine a NOEL for non-genotoxic effects. 4-HR could become an interesting alternative to the use of sulphites to prevent black spot. However, a more complete database is needed to achieve a regulatory evaluation.

TI  - Effect of behavior modification on patient compliance in orthodontics [published erratum appears in Angle Orthod 1999 Feb;69(1):6]  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a reward system for improving patient compliance in orthodontic treatment. The sample consisted of 144 orthodontic patients (63 male, 81 female, average age 12.8 years), 6 to 12 months into their treatment. The sample was divided into above-average and below-average compliers, based on the orthodontic patient cooperation scale (OPCS). Each group was further divided into three subgroups: (a) a control group, which received only standard instructions; (b) an award group, which received compliance instructions and a written evaluation of compliance; and (c) a reward group, which received compliance instructions, a report card, and eligibility to receive rewards for adherent behavior. Two measurements of patient compliance were used: (1) the OPCS, which divided the sample into high and low compliers and was used to compare compliance before and after the 6-month experimental period; and (2) a clinical evaluation of compliance that was based on oral hygiene, appointment punctuality, appliance wear, and appliance maintenance. Evaluations were completed at each monthly appointment. Average compliance scores of above-average compliers showed no significant improvement with rewards. The average scores of patients with below-average compliance did not improve significantly. Only oral hygiene scores in the low compliance reward group were better than in the low compliance control group. Academic performance in school was found to be correlated (p < 0.001) with compliance. Above-average compliers remained above average in their compliance. The award/reward system may help motivate below-average compliers to comply with prescribed instructions.

TI  -  An evaluation of palliative care services for cancer patients in the Southern Health and Social Services Board of Northern Ireland.  
AB  - An interview study of 55 lay carers of people who died from cancer in the Southern Board of Northern Ireland was undertaken using a combination of closed-format and open-ended questions. The aim of the study was to evaluate palliative care services delivered in the last six months of their lives to cancer patients who died either at home or in hospital. Two-thirds of the deaths (36) occurred in the domestic home, 45 of the deceased were admitted as hospital inpatients, and the great majority were in receipt of community nursing (53) and general practitioner (54) services. Open-ended questions were used to allow respondents to give their views about services in some detail and their views about good and bad aspects of services were sought. While they were generally satisfied with services specific areas of difficulty were identified in each aspect of care addressed by the study. The most favourable assessments were made of community nursing with the greatest number of negative comments being made about inpatient hospital care. Differing interests between some of those who were dying and their lay carers were found in two areas: the receipt of help from nonfamily members and the information that the deceased received about their terminal status.

AB  - The purpose of the following study was to examine the kinetic properties of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cell extracts of corneal epithelium. The epithelium, from quality- and size-selected ewe corneas, was dispersed in 10 mM Trizma maleate with or without sucrose at pH 7.0 and cell fractions obtained by homogenisation and differential centrifugation for evaluation of LDH at 37 degrees C. Pyruvate-dependent oxidation of NADH was optimal at pH 6.5, while lactate-dependent reduction of NAD was optimal at pH 9.5; the former activity averaged 3 to 3.5 fold higher than the latter. NADPH and NADP were poor cofactors. The apparent Km values for pyruvate and lactate were 99 micromoles and 3.9 millimoles respectively. At pH 6. 5, substrate inhibition was observed with pyruvate in excess of 0.25 mm with 50% activity measured at 1.2 mm. Excess substrate effects were not seen with lactate at pH 9.5, but pyruvate inhibited lactate-dependent reduction of NAD with 50% activity measured at 1.1 mm. Differential centrifugation confirmed that the activity was predominantly localised in the soluble (post mitochondria-lysosome) fraction of the cells. Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - We report the case of a 78-year-old man in whom routine physical examination revealed cervical adenopathy and splenomegaly. Peripheral blood showed a normal white blood cell count with an absolute lymphocytosis, which included a population with slightly indented nuclei. Lymph node biopsy showed morphology compatible with mantle cell lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy showed replacement by a lymphoid proliferation composed of lymphocytes with features similar to those found in the peripheral blood. Immunophenotypic analysis of both peripheral blood and lymph node showed positivity for CD19, CD20 and CD22, with lambda light chain restriction. Tests for CD5 and CD10 were negative. Cytogenetic analysis and polymerase chain reaction studies confirmed the presence of t(11,14) supporting a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. This unusual case of CD5-negative mantle cell lymphoma exemplifies the importance of combined molecular, cytogenetic, and morphologic evaluation when confronted with a lymphoma having an atypical phenotype.

In this article we describe the development and evaluation of a management protocol for PONV, which consists of a treatment algorithm accompanied by a nursing education program. Implementation of this management protocol has been well-accepted by staff, appears to have reduced delay in patient treatment and improved patient care, and has significantly reduced staff workload. It is planned to use continuous quality improvement techniques to further refine the algorithm and continue assessment of its efficacy and of patient satisfaction.

The assay was carried out on human hepatoma cells (Hep G2) as target cells. A greater number of cells with comets was observed in those treated in vitro with the polluted water samples (70%-88%) than in those in the control (22%, 33%). These preliminary results indicate that comet assay can have an application in biomonitoring studies for determining the potential genotoxicity of water pollutants.

TI  - Evaluation of a proposed panel of cardiac markers for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with atraumatic chest pain.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of a proposed panel of three cardiac markers (myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB mass [CK-MB], and cardiac troponin I) in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with atraumatic chest pain. DESIGN: A total of 110 patients admitted for the evaluation of atraumatic chest pain were examined. Forty-one of these patients were diagnosed with AMI. RESULTS: Five of the 41 patients with AMI had abnormally elevated myoglobin levels, whereas values of CK-MB and/or cardiac troponin I remained negative. Creatine kinase-MB mass alone had a sensitivity of 92.7%, a specificity of 89.9%, a positive predictive value of 84.4%, and a negative predictive value of 95.0% for the diagnosis of AMI. Cardiac troponin I alone had a sensitivity of 90.2%, a specificity of 95.7%, a positive predictive value of 92.5%, and a negative predictive value of 94.3% for the diagnosis of AMI. Cardiac troponin I is a more specific marker for the diagnosis of AMI than CK-MB, particularly in patients with chronic renal failure who are evaluated for chest pain. The combination of CK-MB and cardiac troponin I increased the sensitivity to 100% and the negative predictive value to 100% and had a specificity of 88.4% and a positive predictive value of 83.7%. The panel was diagnostic for all patients with AMI within 12 hours after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that this panel is highly effective for evaluation of AMI in patients with atraumatic chest pain. Elevated myoglobin levels were useful in detecting patients at high risk for AMI who initially were not detected with other markers. The combination of CK-MB and cardiac troponin I provided much higher sensitivity and had a much higher negative predictive value for the evaluation of AMI than cardiac troponin I or CK-MB alone. The 100% negative predictive value is particularly important because it indicates that patients with negative CK-MB and cardiac troponin I values 12 hours after admission have a negligible likelihood of AMI.

TI  - The relationship between probing bone loss and standardized radiographic analysis.  
AB  - This study evaluated the validity of radiographic alveolar bone defect depth measurements to direct probing measurements. The study was planned in two parts. The first part consisted of the evaluation of artificially prepared defects in dry mandibles. These consisted of 3-mm intrabony defects created at the mesial aspect of the second mandibular molar and a Class II furcation defect on the buccal aspect of the first molar. A total of six standardized periapical radiographs with grids were obtained. They were then evaluated by 10 independent examiners who recorded the distance between the alveolar crest (AC) or root junction (RJ) and base of defect (BD) in the proximal and furcation areas of the teeth. Intra- and inter-examiner differences were assessed. Radiographic results showed that these measurements overestimated the mean defect depth values within 0.12 mm in intrabony defects and underestimated within 0.40 mm in Class II furcation defects. The differences between the radiographic and direct dry mandible defect depth measurements were found to be statistically significant (P < .05) with correlation values r = .50 and r = .46, respectively. The clinical part of the study included evaluation of 64 preoperative radiographs taken from patients who underwent various types of periodontal surgery. Mean clinical bone defect depth was found to be 4.20 mm and the mean of the radiographic defect depth measurements was found to be 3.92 mm in intrabony defects. In furcation defects these values were 3.92 mm and 3.55 mm, respectively. The results revealed that (1) a strong correlation existed between the radiographic and clinical assessments in both type of defects (r = .85, P < .001), and that (2) the difference between the two types of assessment methods was generally within 1 mm (58%). It can be concluded that in both dry mandible and clinical studies radiographic interpretation of the intrabony and furcation defects showed differences from the actual bone defect depths.

TI  - Evaluation of the finite element software ABAQUS for biomechanical modelling of biphasic tissues.  
AB  - The biphasic cartilage model proposed by Mow et al. (1980) has proven successful to capture the essential mechanical features of articular cartilage. In order to analyse the joint contact mechanics in real, anatomical joints, the cartilage model needs to be implemented into a suitable finite element code to approximate the irregular surface geometries of such joints. However, systematic and extensive evaluation of the capacity of commercial software for modelling the contact mechanics with biphasic cartilage layers has not been made. This research was aimed at evaluating the commercial finite element software ABAQUS for analysing biphasic soft tissues. The solutions obtained using ABAQUS were compared with those obtained using other finite element models and analytical solutions for three numerical tests: an unconfined indentation test, a test with the contact of a spherical cartilage surface with a rigid plate, and an axi-symmetric joint contact test. It was concluded that the biphasic cartilage model can be implemented into the commercial finite element software ABAQUS to analyse practical joint contact problems with biphasic articular cartilage layers.

TI  - Bisphosphonates and tetracycline: experimental models for their evaluation in calcium-related disorders.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This work was aimed at synthesizing novel bisphosphonates (BPs) and examining them in comparison to clinically used BPs such as pamidronate and alendronate, and to tetracycline, in order to evaluate their potential as anticalcification and antiresorption agents. The correlation between the various models was examined in order to establish facile experimental models for pre-screening of potential compounds. METHODS: Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic, novel BPs such as 2-(3-methylimidazolio) ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid betaine (VS-5b), 2-(2-dimethylamino-4-pyrazinio)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid betaine (VS-6b), and 2-(2-alpha-pyridylethylthio) ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid (ISA-225), were synthesized and evaluated in comparison to clinically used BPs, in various experimental models of resorption and calcification. RESULTS: The physicochemical properties of the novel compounds are slightly different than the BPs in clinical use: the pKa values are lower, the affinity for hydroxyapatite is lower and the solubilities of the calcium salts are higher. The anticalcification potencies of the novel compounds were high and ranked as follows: alendronate = pamidronate > VS-6b = VS-5b = ISA-225 > tetracycline. The in vivo antiresorption activity of VS-5b and VS-6b in comparison to that of the clinically employed, pamidronate, was shown to be similar and higher, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The anticalcification activity of the novel compounds as well as that of tetracycline was lower than that of alendronate. The antiresorption activity of VS-6b was similar to that of pamidronate. A good correlation between the different models was found, enabling the facile screening of novel compounds. The activities of tetracycline and EDTA highlight the distinct behavior of BPs as "crystal poison." In addition, tetracycline was found to be a potent anticalcification agent in the ectopic calcification model.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of three-dimensional spiral computed tomoangiography (3-D spiral CTA) of the abdomen as a substitute for renal angiography in the evaluation of potential live kidney donors. Two of 10 potential live renal donors underwent 3-D spiral CTA only, whereas the remaining 8 underwent 3-D spiral CTA and renal angiography before transplantation. 3-D spiral CTA and renal angiography results were compared and correlated with intraoperative findings. In all 8 cases in which 3-D spiral CTA and renal angiography were compared, the number of arteries was correctly identified by both modalities. In this limited study, 3-D spiral CTA provided the same information as did angiography. According to these findings, 3-D spiral CTA might be used as an alternative to renal angiography, though a larger series is needed to determine whether it could replace renal angiography for all potential live-donor work-ups.

TI  - What makes an automated teller machine usable by blind users?  
AB  - Fifteen blind and sighted subjects, who featured as a control group for acceptance, were asked for their requirements for automated teller machines (ATMs). Both groups also tested the usability of a partially operational ATM mock-up. This machine was based on an existing cash dispenser, providing natural speech output, different function menus and different key arrangements. Performance and subjective evaluation data of blind and sighted subjects were collected. All blind subjects were able to operate the ATM successfully. The implemented speech output was the main usability factor for them. The different interface designs did not significantly affect performance and subjective evaluation. Nevertheless, design recommendations can be derived from the requirement assessment. The sighted subjects were rather open for design modifications, especially the implementation of speech output. However, there was also a mismatch of the requirements of the two subject groups, mainly concerning the key arrangement.

TI  -  Evaluation of patients with round atelectasis using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to determine the spectrum of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET findings in patients with round atelectasis (RA). METHOD: All patients from 1992 to 1997 with radiologic features of RA and FDG-PET scans were evaluated. There were nine men ranging in age from 52 to 75 years (mean 65 years). All had chest radiographs and CT scans that were correlated with FDG-PET. FDG-PET was considered positive if lesion activity was greater than mediastinal activity and negative if lesion activity was the same as or less than mediastinal activity. RESULTS: Nine patients had 10 lesions, ranging in size from 1.2 to 5.0 cm (mean 3.1 cm). Lesion locations were right lower lobe (n = 5), left lower lobe (n = 4), and lingula (n = 1). All lesions were homogeneous and of soft tissue attenuation on CT. None contained air bronchograms or calcification. All had in-curving vessels and bronchi (comet tail sign), adjacent pleural thickening, and volume loss on CT. All lesions were negative on FDG-PET. Four lesions were percutaneously biopsied and showed chronic inflammation consistent with RA. Two lesions were unchanged on 2 and 3 year follow-up CT and were presumed to be RA as were four other lesions with characteristic CT features and negative FDG-PET. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggest that RA in not metabolically active on FDG-PET imaging. Thus, FDG-PET scans can play a role in differentiating RA from malignancy when there are few or atypical features of RA on chest radiographs and CT.

TI  - The preparation of teachers for shared learning environments.  
AB  - This paper outlines a project designed to evaluate shared learning in educational programmes of preparation for nursing, midwifery and health visiting teachers in England, building upon the literature review described in part 1 of this report and a more detailed account available elsewhere. A dearth of research into shared learning and teachers' roles was noted. To address this, an illuminative evaluation approach was taken to elicit quantitative and qualitative data from lecturers on teacher preparation programmes, new teachers who had recently completed these programmes, and more experienced teachers working in colleges of nursing and midwifery. This study that a number of shared learning initiatives exist in teacher preparation centres and colleges of nursing and midwifery. There was general agreement between the participants that it was necessary to prepare teachers to be facilitators in shared learning environments; however, no particular type of preparation was considered essential. The implications for future work are considered.

TI  - A retrospective survey of diagnosis and management of patients presenting with chronic cough to a general chest clinic.  
AB  - Respiratory physicians often encounter patients with chronic cough.  The evaluation and outcome of such patients by centres with established diagnostic protocols has been well described. By contrast, little is known about patients referred to general respiratory clinics where no such protocol exists. We describe the findings of a retrospective survey of all new patient referrals with chronic cough to a general respiratory clinic over a 12-month period. A diagnosis of asthma or chronic airflow obstruction was made in 43% of patients. Gastro-oesophageal reflux and postnasal drip syndrome, together accounting for over 60% of diagnoses in specialist clinics, were infrequently identified in our study (4% and 2% respectively). At follow-up, 43% of patients reported persistent symptoms, contrasting the excellent treatment response reported by specialist clinics. In general respiratory clinics where a specific diagnostic protocol is not in place, these differences in diagnosis and outcome may be due to inadequate investigation or may reflect a different patient population.

TI  - CVVH in postoperative care of liver transplantation.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate CVVH (Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration) as acute renal replacement treatment in postoperative care of liver transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit, year 1995. PATIENTS: 86 OLT performed in 1995, 11 of them underwent acute renal replacement treatment. In the same period, in the ICU were admitted 237 patients, and 20 underwent acute renal replacement treatment (control group).  Evaluation with SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score. INTERVENTION: CVVH performed heparin free, pump system, polyamide or polysulphone 0.6 mq membrane hemofilter device, blood flow 150-200 ml/min, UF rate 1000-1200 ml/h, clearance 16-20 ml/min. MEASUREMENTS: Coagulation monitoring (PT as INR, PTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, d-dimer, platelet count) was performed 3 times a day or on variation of the clinical conditions. RESULTS: SOFA score did not differ between the two groups. Mortality was higher in the patients treated with CVVH. CVVH was performed from 16 to 18 hrs/day for 9.90 +/- 2.33 days. Three patients developed clinical bleeding before CVVH, 3 during CVVH but 1 of them underwent repeated surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: We cannot demonstrate that CVVH doesn't affect bleeding, but we can say that, for the complexity of the post OLT patients, CVVH can be the treatment of choice in case of renal replacement treatment.

TI  - Effect of emulsifier blend on the characteristics of sustained release diclofenac microspheres.  
AB  - This investigation involved the evaluation of the emulsifier blend effect on the development of sustained release diclofenac microspheres intended for use in a suspension formulation. The microspheres were prepared using the hydrophobic congealable disperse phase method. The emulsifier blend consisted of glycerol, monostearate (GMS), a hydrophobic emulsifier with HLB = 3.8, and Tween 80, a hydrophilic emulsifier with a HLB value of 15. The effect of this blend on the encapsulation efficiency, size distribution and drug release from the microspheres was studied. A critical amount of GMS (> 0.2 g) was found to be necessary for good encapsulation efficiency. X-ray diffractograms revealed that the drug retains its crystalline state within the microspheres, indicating that the drug is present as a dispersion within the wax matrix. Increasing amounts of Tween 80 caused an increase in the drug release while increased amounts of GMS retarded the release. The hydrophilic emulsifier and the emulsifier blend influenced the size distribution of the formed microspheres. With an increase in the amount of hydrophilic emulsifier, there was an initial increase in the percent of desired size fraction (137.5 microns) of microspheres followed by a decrease. Microspheres with a larger size released the drug slowly compared to smaller size microspheres, while increase in drug load increased the rate of drug release. The release pattern fitted the Higuchi dissolution kinetics for spherical matrices. Different impeller blade designs formed microspheres that exhibited different release rates. The microspheres (mean size 137.5 microns), had a release profile that made them suitable to be formulated as a sustained release suspension.

TI  - [Erectile dysfunction: psychological causes, diagnosis and therapy]  
AB  - For clinical practice, erectile dysfunction is the most important form of male sexual disorders. In the majority of patients causation and course of their erectile disorder is determined by a close interplay of somatic and psychosocial factors. This psychosomatic interaction has to be taken into account during diagnostic assessment and therapy. The old dichotomous concepts (psychogenic versus organic) of erectile dysfunction have to be replaced by multidimensional models that include dispositonal as well as chronifying factors. The main causes of psychogenic erectile disorders can be divided into three groups, each belonging to a different phase of time: 1. immediate factors (performance anxiety), 2. antecedent life events from recent history, 3. developmental vulnerabilities from childhood and adolescence. The most important instrument for the psychological evaluation of sexually dysfunctional patients is a comprehensive sexual history in which partner related aspects should be particularly focused. In treating psychogenic erectile dysfunctions sex therapy is a reliable and efficient treatment option with a reasonably good long-term prognosis. In future, sex therapy should be combined with somatic treatment options to reach a truly integrative approach to this complex disorder.

TI  -  In situ evaluation of esterase stereoselectivity in two-dimensional electropherograms and tissue sections.  
AB  - Staining with both enantiomers of an alpha-naphthyl ester plus a diazonium salt and comparing the color intensities given by the two enantiomers is a convenient method to evaluate the esterase stereoselectivity for that ester in two-dimensional electropherograms and tissue sections. Application of this method for rat liver has shown that (1) several esterases, e.g., one of pI 6.4 and Mr 118 kDa, are moderately stereoselective against alpha-naphthyl (R)-N-acetylalaninate and (R)-N-methoxycarbonylalaninate but strictly stereoselective against alpha-naphthyl (S)-N-methoxycarbonylvalinate, implying that esterase stereoselectivity may be inverted by changing the ester structure; and (2) these esterases are mainly contained in the hepatocytes around central veins.

TI  - Clinical, haematological and radiological evaluation of fragmented autogenous cortical bone grafting of radius in dogs.  
AB  - In eight clinically healthy dogs, a midshaft diaphyseal defect of 2 cm was created in the right radius ulna. This gap was maintained by fixing a four hole sherman bone plate on the radius. In four dogs, the gap was filled with autogenous cancellous bone grafts (2-5 mm in diameter) harvested from the proximal end of the tibia (group 1). In the remaining 4 dogs, the fracture gap was filled with autogenous cortical bone fragments (ACBF) of 2-5 mm diameter made from the same 2 cm piece of bone removed from the radius. While comparing various clinical observations, it appeared that healing of the wounds and bearing of the weight on the grafted limb in dogs subjected to ACBF graft were similar to those given autogenous cancellous bone graft. In radiographs, taken on the 30th day in group 1, a fairly good amount of callus was found emerging from fracture ends but the whole of the bone graft area was not covered by bony density even on the 60th day. In group 2 (ACBF), 45th day radiograph revealed that the callus from the fracture end was mixing up with the cortical bone fragments, and at the 60th day, the callus was clearly found invading the cortical bone fragments grafted in the fracture gap.

TI  - Cost-effective evaluation of indeterminate urinary cytology.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We reviewed our management of indeterminate urinary cytologies to determine which patients warrant urological evaluation. Our goal was to develop a cost-effective evaluation scheme that detects the most cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed case histories of 389 patients with indeterminate urinary cytology who had undergone complete urological evaluations. Upper urinary tract imaging and cystoscopy were required to exclude malignancy, and tissue biopsy results were recorded in all individuals diagnosed with cancer. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the significance of clinical factors that would suggest the necessity of complete urinary system evaluation. Marginal cost-effectiveness rates were applied to various clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Of 389 patients 60 (15%) had urinary tract malignancy. A history of urothelial malignancy and hematuria were the only significant factors that suggested complete evaluation was necessary. If smoking history were included 59 of the 60 malignancies would have been detected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with indeterminate urinary cytology who are nonsmokers and have neither hematuria nor a history of urothelial cancer are at low risk for malignancy and do not warrant complete evaluation.

TI  -  [Prospective evaluation of antidepressant discontinuation]  
AB  - The authors prospectively assessed symptoms induced by the interruption of antidepressants in 16 patients (11 women and 5 men), aged from 33 to 85 years (mean = 52.4 +/- 16.4), treated with antidepressants since at least two weeks. All patients were free of alcohol abuse or dependence disorder and of other dependence to psychoactive substances. None of them presented medical illness. Diagnosis were made by separate evaluations by two authors and confirmed with a semistructered assessment instrument: the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (Lifetime Version). All patients were submitted to a brutal discontinuation of their antidepressant agent. Patients were assessed twice, before the interruption of the antidepressant, and 72 hours later. Effects of antidepressant interruption were assessed by several means. Modification of anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Symptoms of withdrawal were assessed with Cassano and al.'s scale SESSH including an evaluation of anxiety, agitation, irritability, anergy, difficulty on concentrating, depersonalization, sleep and appetite disorders, muscle pains, nausea, tremor, sweating, altered taste, hyperosmia, paresthesias, photophobia, motor incoordination, dizziness, hyperacousia pain, delirium. Fourteen of the 16 patients (87.5%) presented modifications of their somatic or psychic state 3 days after the interruption of the antidepressant treatment. Most frequent symptoms were: increase in anxiety (31%), increase in irritability (25%), sleep disorders (19%), decrease of anergia and fatigue (19%). Mean scores of anxiety and depression were not significantly modified by the withdrawal. Following TCAs interruption (7 patients) most frequent symptoms were sleep disorders; increase in anxiety, nausea. Among patients withdrawn from SSRIs (6 patients), most frequent symptoms were increase in anxiety, increase in irritability, headache. Patients also presented a decrease of nausea, and of anorexia.

TI  - Evaluation of muscle protein mass in children with solid tumors by muscle thickness measurement with ultrasonography, as compared with anthropometric methods and visceral protein concentrations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the merits of regional ultrasonography, anthropometry, and measurement of visceral protein concentrations for determining muscle protein mass and nutritional status. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SUBJECTS: Nineteen children (median age 4.7 y, range, 1.4-14.1 y) with malignant solid tumors were examined at diagnosis, monthly during preoperative chemotherapy, and 1-2 months after operation; 19 healthy age- and sex-matched children served as controls. INTERVENTIONS: We measured the thickness of the quadriceps muscle by ultrasonography (muscle index), and body weight, mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, and serum concentrations of albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the muscle index was smaller in the patients (mean 5.6 cm2/m2, 95% CI 4.5-6.7 cm2/m2) than in the controls (8.5 cm2/m2, 95% CI 7.7-9.3 cm2/m2) (P = 0.0007), whereas the anthropometric measurements did not differ. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of anthropometry and measurements of visceral proteins were poor in detecting reduced muscle protein reserves when compared with the muscle index as the baseline standard. During the anticancer therapy the mean concentrations of serum albumin and prealbumin increased. CONCLUSIONS: In children with cancer, nutritional status should be assessed with methods more sensitive than anthropometry and visceral protein concentration measurements. We advocate regional ultrasonography for the evaluation of nutrition in these patients.

TI  - Implant anchored complete mandibular denture: evaluation of masticatory efficiency, oral function and degree of satisfaction.  
AB  - Masticatory efficiency, oral function and degree of satisfaction with the treatment received were analysed in a group of fully edentulous patients with severe atrophy of the mandibular bone, rehabilitated with complete removable dentures, before and after anchoring the dentures to osseointegrated implants. Masticatory efficiency increased significantly and chewing cycles increased in amplitude after anchoring the denture. The component of the chewing cycle that most influenced the increase in functional area was the lateral one. A correlation was found between the increase in the lateral component of the chewing cycle and the increased masticatory efficiency achieved with implant-anchored dentures. The degree of satisfaction with their rehabilitation reported by the subjects was correlated neither to increased masticatory efficiency nor to improved oral function.

TI  - [Eyberg inventory of child behavior. Standardization of the Spanish version and its usefulness in ambulatory pediatrics (published erratum appears in An Esp Pediatr 1998 Jun;48(6):668]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Taking into account the high prevalence of behavioral problems in the pediatric outpatient clinic, a need for a useful and easy to administer tool for the evaluation of this problem arises. The psychometric characteristics of the Spanish version of the Eyberg Behavioral Child Inventory (EBCI), [in Spanish Inventario de Eyberg para el Comportamiento de Nino (IECN)], a 36-item questionnaire were established. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ECBI inventory/questionnaire was translated into Spanish. The basis of the ECBI is the evaluation of the child's behavior through the parents' answers to the questionnaire. Healthy children between 2 and 12 years of age were included and were taken from pediatric outpatient clinics from urban and suburban areas of Barcelona and from our hospital's own ambulatory clinic. RESULTS: The final sample included 518 subjects. The mean score on the intensity scale was 96.8 and on the problem scale 3.9. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.73 and the test-retest had an r of 0.89 (p < 0.001) for the intensity scale and r = 0.93 (p < 0.001) for the problem scale. Interrater reliability for the intensity scale was r = 0.58 (p < 0.001) and r = 0.32 (p < 0.001) for the problem scale. Concurrent validity between both scales was r = 0.343 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The IECN is a useful and easy tool to apply in the pediatrician's office as a method for early detection of behavior problems.

TI  - [Meatoplasty by intra-aural approach]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The object of this communication was to discuss our experience with a new type of endaural meatoplasty. Auricular meatoplasty was described by Viennese otologists in the late nineteenth century. A hundred years later the procedure still is necessary for every open mastoidectomy. Most surgeons prefer to perform meatoplasty following traditional guidelines via a retroauricular incision. However, we have developed a new meatoplasty method using an endaural approach, similar to that described by Osborne Farrior and Fleury but performed at the beginning of the operation. The advantage of the procedure is that the size and shape of the cartilage to be removed are easily calculated. Therefore, the width of the future external canal can be predicted. Using this meatoplasty, the tragal cartilage can be removed as a whole piece with its perichondrium. This is important for middle-ear reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty-seven meatoplasties via an endaural approach were performed in the last 6 years, most as a step in open mastoidectomy. The procedure is described in detail for the cases in which it was used. RESULTS: Two parameters were considered in the evaluation of results: permanence of a dry and stable mastoid cavity and an intact eardrum. Only 3 (1.4%) ears out of 223 remained unstable after 3 years and 5 (2.24%) continued with a perforated eardrum. DISCUSSION: Meatoplasty via an endaural approach allowed us to design precisely the size and shape of the conchal cartilage to be removed and to calculate the volume of the future external canal. This approach can be used to remove a cartilaginous conchal fragment with its perichondrium. This piece is useful for the reconstruction of the middle ear or mastoid. Realization of this meatoplasty at the beginning of the procedure produces a broad exposure of the mastoid.

TI  - Delay in thrombolysis administration: causes of extended door-to-drug times and the asymptote effect.  
AB  - We retrospectively analyzed medical records and critical pathway data forms of all patients who received thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) over a 2 1/2-year period. The time spent by each patient in the emergency department (ED) prior to receiving thrombolytic therapy (the door-to-drug time) was determined. Records of those patients with door-to-drug times exceeding the median were closely examined to determine the cause of treatment delays. Results indicated that treatment delays resulted from delays in obtaining the initial electrocardiogram (24%), atypical presentations (11%), the need to rule out a potential contraindication (11%), the need to confirm the diagnosis (14%), and miscellaneous causes (8%). Many patients had no identifiable reason for their delay (32%). A certain population of AMI patients either do not satisfy thrombolytic criteria upon initial ED presentation or require prolonged evaluation to investigate possible contraindications to thrombolysis such as aortic dissection. The inclusion of patients in this separate population in a general analysis of median door-to-drug times results in an artificial asymptote effect and may confound quality initiatives.

TI  - An in vitro and in vivo evaluation of various implant-cleaning instruments.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The surface roughness caused by four implant scalers (Premier/Hawe-Neos, Advanced Implant Technologies, Hu-Friedy, and Nobel Biocare) on a titanium abutment was assessed in a standardized in vitro situation, and operators were asked to evaluate the clinical usefulness of each instrument. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four evaluators scored scanning electron micrographs of abutment surfaces scaled for 15 minutes with each instrument. Twelve operators used each instrument on at least three implant recall patients and scored each for ease of access; efficacy in deposit removal; overall convenience; distance reached subgingivally; scaling time per abutment; and overall preference. RESULTS: The Advanced Implant Technologies scaler created a significantly rougher surface than all other instruments. The Premier/Hawe-Neos and Advanced Implant Technologies instruments were significantly preferred in most categories by the operators. There was no statistically significant difference in scaling time per abutment. CONCLUSION: The Premier/Hawe-Neos instrument combines operator acceptance with less damage to the abutments, and, of the instruments tested, is the scaler of choice.

The child was otherwise healthy and endocrine evaluation was normal. Previous treatments had no effect, oral isotretinoine led to cure without secondary effects. COMMENTS: The etiology of infantile acne is not clearly defined, but may result from a persisting androgen-driven stimulation of sebaceous glands. Oral isotretinoin is safe and effective in case of recalcitrant infantile acne, but close monitoring is necessary because of the well-known side effects of oral retinoids.

TI  -  Evaluation of intracranial cysts by intraoperative MR.  
AB  - Eleven patients with intracranial cystic collections were evaluated in the open-bore intraoperative MR system. In each case, the cystic collection or the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space was injected with .02 to .5 cc of .5 mol/l gadopentetate dimeglumine. Serial imaging was performed using T1-weighted imaging. In seven patients, free communication was demonstrated between the cystic collection and the surrounding CSF spaces. In four cases, the cyst did not communicate with the CSF; two of these were drained in the intraoperative MR system with reduction in symptoms. One patient developed an aseptic meningitis 10 days after the study, which was successfully treated with steroids; no other complications were noted. We conclude that the communication of intracranial cystic collections with the cisterns and ventricles can be safely and effectively elucidated with gadolinium injection in the intraoperative MR system.

TI  - Carcinoids of the colon and ileocecal region: a statistical evaluation of 363 cases collected from the literature.  
AB  - The colon and ileocecal region are rare sites of origin for gastrointestinal carcinoids. This study evaluates the present status and characteristics of carcinoids of these particular sites in a statistically reliable number of cases and offers fundamental information for future analysis and treatment of these neoplasias. A total of 363 cases of colonic and ileocecal carcinoids were collected from international literature and evaluated in the computer analyzing system. For the final evaluation, 279 cases with sufficient information, consisting of 203 colonic and 76 ileocecal carcinoids, were selected for analysis. In addition, 69 cases of atypical varieties in identical sites were studied for a comparison of 5-year survival rates with the 279 ordinary colonic and ileocecal carcinoids. The characteristic features of colonic and ileocecal carcinoids included: 1) a female preponderance and older age group in the ileocecal carcinoids; 2) a higher incidence of carcinoids in the cecum as compared to those of the rest of the colon followed by the ileocecal region; 3) a high incidence of palpable abdominal tumors resulting from a tendency of the tumors to be large (89.7% were over 2 cm); 4) a high incidence of metastases (61.3%); 5) a high incidence of Grimelius argyrophilia (100.0%) and argentaffin cell type (85.7%) in ileocecal carcinoids; 6) a low detection rate of serotonin in immunohistochemical (66.7%) and laboratory (68.7%) evaluation; and 7) a low postoperative 5-year survival rate (40.5% by the crude calculation method and 65.3% by the Kaplan-Meier method). The present statistical evaluation disclosed a considerable delay in detecting colonic and ileocecal carcinoids resulting in extensive and aggressive surgical treatments and poor postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Indications for corticosteroids prior to epididymal sperm retrieval.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose intermittent prednisone treatment designed to reduce antisperm antibodies for men prior to epididymal sperm retrieval and in vitro fertilization. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of 75 subfertile men with reproductive obstruction due to congenital absence of the vas deferens, or other reproductive tract obstruction, who underwent a total of 98 episodes of microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) with in vitro fertilization. RESULTS: For couples in whom the man was pretreated with prednisone, better fertilization rates (39% vs. 21%, P < .0001) and pregnancy rates (48% vs. 26%, p = 0.06) were obtained than in couples in whom the man was not pretreated. The benefit of prednisone treatment was most noticeable for men with preoperatively detectable antisperm antibodies. Prednisone-treated men with preoperative antisperm antibodies showed improved fertilization rates (40% vs. 9%, p = 0.005). Men without antibodies who were treated with prednisone showed a decrement in fertilization rate, from 73% to 24% (fertilizations per oocyte, P < .0005). Success of prednisone treatment could not be correlated with specific assisted-reproduction technique (IVF, PZD, SuZI, or ICSI). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative evaluation of antisperm antibody status and treatment of antibody-positive men prior to epididymal sperm retrieval may play a role in improvement of the fertilization and pregnancy results achieved by centers that provide MESA with assisted reproduction. These results are most important when MESA is performed without the assistance of intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Empiric treatment with prednisone may be detrimental to the fertility of men who have no antisperm antibodies.

TI  - Age-race subgroup compared with renin profile as predictors of blood pressure response to antihypertensive therapy. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: Renin profiling and age-race subgroup may help select single-drug therapy for stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To compare the plasma renin profiling and age-race subgroup methods as predictors of response to single-drug therapy in men with stage 1 and 2 hypertension as defined by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. DESIGN: The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on Single-Drug Therapy of Hypertension, a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Fifteen Veterans Affairs hypertension centers. PATIENTS: A total of 1105 ambulatory men with entry diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 to 109 mm Hg, of whom 1031 had valid plasma and urine samples for renin profiling. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to 1 of 6 antihypertensive drugs: hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem (sustained release), or prazosin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Treatment response as assessed by percentage achieving goal DBP (<90 mm Hg) in response to a single drug that corresponded to patients' renin profile vs a single drug that corresponded to patients' age-race subgroup. RESULTS: Clonidine and diltiazem had consistent response rates regardless of renin profile (76%, 67%, and 80% for low, medium, and high renin, respectively, for clonidine and 83%, 82%, and 83%, respectively, for diltiazem for patients with baseline DBP of 95-99 mm Hg). Hydrochlorothiazide and prazosin were best in low- and medium-renin profiles; captopril was best in medium- and high-renin profiles (low-, medium-, and high-renin response rates were 82%, 78%, and 14%, respectively, for hydrochlorothiazide; 88%, 67%, and 40%, respectively, for prazosin; and 51%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, for captopril for patients with baseline DBP of 95-99 mm Hg). Response rates for patients with baseline DBP of 95 to 99 mm Hg by age-race subgroup ranged from 70% for clonidine to 90% for prazosin for younger black men, from 50% for captopril to 97% for diltiazem for older black men, from 70% for hydrochlorothiazide to 92% for atenolol for younger white men, and from 84% for hydrochlorothiazide to 95% for diltiazem for older white men. Patients with a correct treatment for their renin profile but incorrect for age-race subgroup had a response rate of 58.7%; patients with an incorrect treatment for their renin profile but correct for age-race subgroup had a response rate of 63.1% (P = .30). After controlling for DBP and interactions with treatment group, age-race subgroup (P<.001) significantly predicted response to single-drug therapy, whereas renin profile was of borderline significance (P= .05). CONCLUSIONS: In these men with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, therapeutic responses were consistent with baseline renin profile, but age-race subgroup was a better predictor of response.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of tazobactam/piperacillin in the pediatric field]  
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation was conducted on the combination drug, tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC, YP-14), of newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and antibiotic agent of penicillin group for injections, piperacillin (PIPC), and the following results were obtained. 1. Absorption and excretion Both serum levels of TAZ and PIPC after the intravenous drip infusion for 30 minutes at the dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of TAZ/PIPC showed peaks at the end of the intravenous drip infusion (in 30 minutes after the commencement of the administration) with the levels of 11.93 or 26.05 micrograms/ml for TAZ and 49.80 or 107.50 micrograms/ml for PIPC. The halflife times were 0.51 or 0.67 hours for TAZ and 0.51 or 0.54 hours for PIPC. The serum level of desethyl-piperacillin (DEt-PIPC), an active metabolite of PIPC, showed a peak one hour after the end of the intravenous drip infusion (in 90 minutes after the commencement of the administration) with the level of 0.79 or 1.47 micrograms/ml. On the other hand, cumulative recovery ratios into urine were 41.3% or 40.4% for TAZ and 38.7% or 37.8% for PIPC. The recovery ratio for DEt-PIPC, an active metabolite of PIPC, was 1.9% or 0.3%. 2. Clinical evaluation TAZ/PIPC was administered to 47 cases (pneumonia: 25 cases, bronchitis: 16 cases, cutaneous soft tissue infection: 3 cases, urinary tract infection: 2 cases and lymphadenitis: 1 case). Clinical efficacy evaluation was conducted in 45 cases, excluding one case with bronchitis complicated by measles and other one case with left cervical cellulitis complicated by mumps. Good or more efficacy was observed in the all cases (excellent efficacy: 28 cases and good efficacy: 17 cases). The eradication rate in 31 cases where the pathogenic bacteria were identified and bacteriological efficacy was revealed was 93.5% (29/31 cases). Out of them, bacterial replacement was observed in 5 cases. Decrease in bacteria (including partial eradication) was observed in the remaining 2 cases. Adverse reactions were not reported in any cases. Abnormal values of clinical laboratory examination were reported in 5 cases (increase in platelet count: 2 cases, decrease in leukocyte count: 2 cases and increase in eosinophil count: 1 case). However, there was no case requiring any treatment.

TI  - The effect of investigator compliance (observer bias) on calculated efficacy in a pertussis vaccine trial.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the course of a large pertussis vaccine efficacy trial we realized that investigator compliance could have a major impact on calculated vaccine efficacy. DESIGN: In our pertussis vaccine efficacy trial, the study investigators were to monitor illness in study families by telephone every 2 weeks. If a cough illness of >/=7 days duration was noted, the study child was to be evaluated. If the cough illness persisted for >/=14 days, the child was to be referred to a central investigator. For this report we analyzed study physician evaluation rates and rates of referral to the central investigators. Physician practices were separated into three compliance categories: high, intermediate, and low. We analyzed vaccine efficacy of an acellular pertussis component DTP vaccine (DTaP) and a whole cell pertussis component DTP vaccine (DTP) by compliance category. Bordetella pertussis infection was documented by culture of the organism in the study child or in a household contact or by a significant antibody response to pertussis toxin determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Using a clinical case definition that included both mild and typical pertussis (cough illness >/=7 days duration) efficacy of DTaP vaccine was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -3-65) in the high compliance category and 78% (95% CI = 65-86) and 75% (95% CI = 53-87) in the intermediate and low compliance groups, respectively. Similar, but less marked, differences in efficacy were noted with DTP vaccine recipients. Using a clinical case definition that required >/=21 days of cough with paroxysms, whoop, or vomiting (typical pertussis) the efficacy of DTaP vaccine was 69% (95% CI = 41-83) in the high compliance category and 86% (95% CI = 76-92) and 84% (95% CI = 64-93) in the intermediate and low compliance groups, respectively. In contrast, the efficacy of DTP vaccine did not vary by compliance category using this case definition. The attack rate in children vaccinated with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (DT) was twofold less in low compliance physician practices when compared with the rates in high and intermediate groups. The DT/DTaP and DT/DTP fold-change differences were less in the high compliance group compared with the intermediate and low compliance groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that observer compliance (observer bias), can significantly inflate calculated vaccine efficacy. It is likely that all recently completed efficacy trials have been effected by this type of observer bias and all vaccines have considerably less efficacy against mild disease than published data suggest.

TI  - MR imaging of acute transverse myelitis (myelopathy).  
AB  - The purpose of our study was to review the MR characteristics of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) retrospectively and to review the literature. The subjects were 26 patients (two males, 24 females). MR examinations were carried out using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. MR imaging in eight of 16 lesions in nine subjects with preexisting MS showed multiple areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sagittal images, and 11 lesions had no cord swelling. Twelve of 16 lesions showed heterogeneous enhancement. MR imaging in 10 of 13 lesions in 12 subjects with preexisting HTLV-1 infection, mycoplasma pneumonia infection, hepatitis B vaccinations, and uncertain etiologies revealed fusiform increased signal intensity areas on T2-weighted sagittal images and cord swelling. Seven of 11 lesions in the patients who underwent injection of contrast medium showed heterogeneous enhancement, whereas others showed no enhancement. MR examination is recommended for the evaluation of ATM.

TI  - A new copolymerized composite resin system: a multiphased evaluation.  
AB  - Most microfilled composite resins are relatively resistant to generalized wear; however, they commonly exhibit poor resistance to localized wear because of debonding of prepolymerized particles from the resin matrix. A copolymerized new composite resin, in which the filler particle trimethylolpropane-trimethacrylate is chemically bonded to the resin matrix, is evaluated. Epic-TMPT was subjected to both generalized and localized wear tests that revealed that its wear resistance was higher than that of other composite resin systems. Epic-TMPT in posterior occlusal cavities showed less than 8 microns of wear for each restoration, 1 year after placement. Placement of Epic-TMPT into large anterior abfraction lesions without mechanical retention, with surface etching, and subject to severe traumatic occlusion resulted in 87% retention 1 year after placement. In vivo usage biocompatibility tests demonstrated no pulpal irritation or inflammation when Epic-TMPT was placed on vital dentin of crown preparations with complete enamel removal.
