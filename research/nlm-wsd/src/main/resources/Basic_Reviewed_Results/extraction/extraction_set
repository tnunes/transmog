TI  - Laparoscopy-assisted penile revascularization: a new method.  
AB  - Analysis of more than 100 penile revascularizations using the Mannheim modification showed a success rate as high as 82% in properly selected patients. However, the dissection of the epigastric artery requires a relatively large incision, with the risk of postoperative bleeding, pain, and hernia formation. Therefore, we designed a laparoscopic approach for dissection of the epigastric vessels. From January 1995 to October 1996, we performed laparoscopy-assisted penile revascularization in 15 pharmacotesting nonresponders with erectile dysfunction. The first step is dissection of the penile vessels to minimize the occlusion time of the epigastric arteries. Thereafter, the extraperitoneal cavity is exposed using a balloon-trocar system inserted via a 15-mm suprapubic incision. A pneumoextraperitoneum is established, and two further cannulas are inserted (10 mm subumbilical, 5 mm in the lower abdomen contralateral to the desired epigastric artery). The dissection of the epigastric vessels starts caudally at the origin from the external iliac vessels and continues to the periumbilical area. All branches are dissected between clips, keeping the artery and vein together.  For extraction of the artery, we insert another 5-mm port through the incision at the penile base. After desufflation of the extraperitoneal space and closure of the trocar wounds, microsurgical penile revascularization is performed using the previously described modification of the Hauri procedure. The mean operating time for laparoscopic dissection of epigastric artery was 120 minutes. No intraoperative complication occurred. One patient suffered from an inguinal hematoma. After a median follow-up of 12 month, 53% of patients showed spontaneous erections, and another 27% achieved a full erection with the aid of additional pharmacotherapy. Laparoscopic dissection of the epigastric arteries proved to be feasible, resulting in a considerable reduction of overall morbidity of penile revascularization without reducing the efficacy of the procedure.

TI  - Pulmonary artery catheters in cardiovascular disease.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature addressing the use of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in patients with cardiovascular disease. DATA SOURCE: All pertinent English language articles dealing with pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with cardiovascular disease were retrieved from 1976 through 1996. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were chosen for review if the use of pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with cardiovascular disease was studied or reviewed.  DATA EXTRACTION: From the articles selected, information was obtained about changes in therapy and changes in outcome associated with PAC use in patients with cardiovascular disease. DATA SYNTHESIS: Whether enhanced understanding of patient hemodynamics translates into definable benefits for those patients has recently come into question. Although there are a number of conventional clinical indications for pulmonary artery catheterization, and several studies have shown that catheterization prompts changes in therapy in many patients, most data regarding outcomes are retrospective; prospective randomized trials are lacking. Nonetheless, we believe, based on the available evidence and the preponderance of expert opinion, that management with the PAC improves outcome in several patient populations. These populations include: a) patients with acute myocardial infarction either complicated by cardiogenic shock or progressive hypotension, or associated with mechanical complications; b) patients with congestive heart failure refractory to empiric therapy; c) patients with pulmonary hypertension; and d) patients with shock or hemodynamic instability. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary artery catheterization is often used to optimize patient management, although this may not be demonstrable in terms of prospective trials using mortality or other "hard" outcome measures. Nonetheless, more rapid diagnosis and achievement of therapeutic endpoints guided by PAC use can decrease morbidity and intensive care days.

TI  - Altered extent of cross-linking of beta1,6-glucosylated mannoproteins to chitin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants with reduced cell wall beta1,3-glucan content.  
AB  - The yeast cell wall contains beta1,3-glucanase-extractable and beta1,3-glucanase-resistant mannoproteins. The beta1,3-glucanase-extractable proteins are retained in the cell wall by attachment to a beta1,6-glucan moiety, which in its turn is linked to beta1,3-glucan (J. C. Kapteyn, R. C. Montijn, E. Vink, J. De La Cruz, A. Llobell, J. E. Douwes, H. Shimoi, P. N. Lipke, and F. M. Klis, Glycobiology 6:337-345, 1996). The beta1,3-glucanase-resistant protein fraction could be largely released by exochitinase treatment and contained the same set of beta1,6-glucosylated proteins, including Cwp1p, as the B1,3-glucanase-extractable fraction. Chitin was linked to the proteins in the beta1,3-glucanase-resistant fraction through a beta1,6-glucan moiety. In wild-type cell walls, the beta1,3-glucanase-resistant protein fraction represented only 1 to 2% of the covalently linked cell wall proteins, whereas in cell walls of fks1 and gas1 deletion strains, which contain much less beta1,3-glucan but more chitin, beta1,3-glucanase-resistant proteins represented about 40% of the total. We propose that the increased cross-linking of cell wall proteins via beta1,6-glucan to chitin represents a cell wall repair mechanism in yeast, which is activated in response to cell wall weakening.

TI  - Bone marrow-generated dendritic cells pulsed with tumor extracts or tumor RNA induce antitumor immunity against central nervous system tumors.  
AB  - Recent studies have shown that the brain is not a barrier to successful active immunotherapy that uses gene-modified autologous tumor cell vaccines. In this study, we compared the efficacy of two types of vaccines for the treatment of tumors within the central nervous system (CNS): dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines pulsed with either tumor extract or tumor RNA, and cytokine gene-modified tumor vaccines. Using the B16/F10 murine melanoma (B16) as a model for CNS tumor, we show that vaccination with bone marrow-generated DCs, pulsed with either B16 cell extract or B16 total RNA, can induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes against B16 tumor cells. Both types of DC vaccines were able to protect animals from tumors located in the CNS. DC-based vaccines also led to prolonged survival in mice with tumors placed before the initiation of vaccine therapy. The DC-based vaccines were at least as effective, if not more so, as vaccines containing B16 tumor cells in which the granulocytic macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene had been modified. These data support the use of DC-based vaccines for the treatment of patients with CNS tumors.

TI  -  Robotic solid-phase extraction of amphetamines from urine for analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  
AB  - We have evaluated the use of the Hamilton Microlab 2200 robotic pipetting system modified to conduct solid-phase extractions of amphetamines from urine. The Hamilton system is a programmable XYZ robotic sample handling instrument compatible with commercial solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns in the most commonly available sizes. During the extraction and elution steps, the system delivers programmable positive pressure with pressure controlled feedback so as to ensure consistent recovery. The system increases sample throughput while reducing technician hands-on time and improving sample-to-sample and batch-to-batch consistency. In comparison with the manual SPE method, the automated scheme provides similar analyte recovery, accuracy, and precision and a reduced potential for laboratory errors. The method's upper limits of linearity, detection, and lquantitation were, respectively, 10,000, 100, and 100 ng/mL for amphetamine and 25,000, 50, and 50 ng/mL for methamphetamine. Extraction recoveries for the compounds ranged from 88 to 101%. Carryover amounted to less than 0.02% even at 50,000 ng/mL concentrations of analyte. A typical automated run required 20 min of technician time versus 90 min for a corresponding manual SPE procedure. The automated procedure proved to be a reliable and labor-efficient addition to the laboratory.

TI  - Hypoglycaemic, antihyperglycaemic and hypolipidemic activities of Caesalpinia bonducella seeds in rats.  
AB  - Hypoglycaemic, antihyperglycaemic and hypolipidemic activities of the aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts of Caesalpinia bonducella Fleming (Leguminosae) seeds were studied in normal and streptozotocin (SZ)-diabetic rats. In normal rats, both the extracts exhibited hypoglycaemic activity as early as 4 h after administration at a lower dose of 100 mg/kg. The hypoglycaemia produced by the aqueous extract was of prolonged duration as compared to ethanolic extract. In diabetic rats, both the extracts produced significant (P < 0.01) antihyperglycaemic effect from day 5 onwards. Aqueous extract also exhibited antihypercholesterolemic and antihypertriglyceridemic effects in SZ-diabetic rats. These results suggest that C. bonducella seeds possess an antidiabetic principle and can be useful for treatment of diabetes. Further studies are warranted to fractionate the active principle and to find out its exact mechanism of action.

TI  - Efficacy of intraarch mechanics using differential moments for achieving anchorage control in extraction cases.  
AB  - A prospective survey was conducted to test the hypothesis that maximum anchorage can be achieved in the maxillary arch by controlling forces and moments using intraarch mechanics while retracting canines into first premolar extraction sites. The sample consisted of 24 patients (mean age 18 years, 9 months) who required the extraction of two maxillary first premolars, with or without extractions in the mandibular arch. Movements of the first molars, canines, and incisors were evaluated with 6 cephalometric variables and 10 study model variables. T tests were used to assess differences between pretreatment and postretraction tooth positions. Cephalometrically, the maxillary first molars (left and right sides combined) moved mesially ONLY 0.7 mm (SD 0.43; p < 0.008). All other cephalometric variables showed no significant differences between the two time points. From the study models, the molars moved mesially ONLY 0.5 mm on both the right and left sides (right side SD = 0.43 and left side SD = 0.38; p < 0.005), while the canines were retracted on average 5.8 mm on the right side and 5.6 mm on the left. The molars and canines showed significant mesiopalatal and distolingual rotations, respectively. Many of the study model and cephalometric variables were significantly correlated to one another. This study questions the need to use adjunctive appliances, which directs a distal force to the posterior teeth, if horizontal molar anchorage control is a treatment objective. By controlling forces and moments, using intraarch mechanics while retracting maxillary canines into first premolar extraction sites, minimal molar anchorage loss occurred.

TI  - Proboscidean DNA from museum and fossil specimens: an assessment of ancient DNA extraction and amplification techniques.  
AB  - Applications of reliable DNA extraction and amplification techniques to postmortem samples are critical to ancient DNA research. Commonly used methods for isolating DNA from ancient material were tested and compared using both soft tissue and bones from fossil and contemporary museum proboscideans. DNAs isolated using three principal methods served as templates in subsequent PCR amplifications, and the PCR products were directly sequenced. Authentication of the ancient origin of obtained nucleotide sequences was established by demonstrating reproducibility under a blind testing system and by phylogenetic analysis. Our results indicate that ancient samples may respond differently to extraction buffers or purification procedures, and no single method was universally successful. A CTAB buffer method, modified from plant DNA extraction protocols, was found to have the highest success rate. Nested PCR was shown to be a reliable approach to amplify ancient DNA templates that failed in primary amplification.

TI  - Mechanism of proton entry into the cytoplasmic section of the proton-conducting channel of bacteriorhodopsin.  
AB  - Bacteriorhodopsin is the light-driven proton-pumping protein of Halobacterium salinarum that extracts protons from the well-buffered cytoplasmic space within the time limits set by the photocycle turnover. The specific mechanism of the proton uptake by the cytoplasmic surface of the protein was investigated in this study by the laser-induced proton pulse technique. The purple membrane preparations were labeled by fluorescein at two residues (36 or 38) of the cytoplasmic surface of the protein, sites that are close to the orifice of the proton-conducting channel. The membranes were pulsed by protons discharged from photoexcited pyranine [Nachliel, E., Gutman, M., Kiryati, S., and Dencher, N.A. (1996) Proc. Nat Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93, 10747-10752). The reaction of the discharged protons with the pyranine anion and the fluorescein was measured with sub-microsecond resolution. The experimental signals were reconstructed through numeric integration of differential rate equations which quantitated the rates of all proton transfer reactions between all reactants present in the system. The interaction of protons with the orifice of the cytoplasmic channel is enhanced by the exposed carboxylates of the protein. A cluster of three carboxylates acts as a strong proton attractor site while one carboxylate, identified as D36, acts as a mediator that delivers the proton to the channel. The combination of these reactions render the surface of the protein with properties of a proton-collecting antenna. The size of the collecting area is less than that of the protein's surface.

TI  - Intracellular responses of the rat cochlear nucleus to sound and its role in temporal coding.  
AB  - The anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the first centre of the central auditory pathway, contains globular bushy cells, which are unique in their ability to produce fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Using in vivo intracellular recordings in the rat AVCN we examined these fast EPSPs in relation to temporal coding. At frequencies up to 2.5 kHz, EPSPs were evoked on successive sine waves of the stimulus with EPSP summation limited. This one-to-one relationship between the EPSPs and the sound wave period was present at higher frequencies and over a greater intensity range than for action potentials. These results suggest that temporal coding is possible in globular bushy neurones by their ability to extract temporal information through fast processing of convergent presynaptic input.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro immunomodulation induced by the extract of the mycelium fungus Polyporus squamosus.  
AB  - The mycelial mass of the fungus Polyporus Squamosus strain 64 (PS-64) was disintegrated by mechanical and ultrasound treatments. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the disintegrate was dialyzed and lyophilized. The resultant PS-64 extract was subsequently investigated as an immunomodulator of IgE and IgG responses to ovalbumin (OA) in (CBAxC57BL/6)F1 mice using passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Multiple injections of PS-64 extract in doses of 1.5, 15, and 150 mg/kg administered before the primary or secondary immunization of mice with OA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of both IgE and IgG antibody responses to OA. In contrast to the inhibition of the anti-OA IgE response noted during the entire 3-week observation period, the anti-OA IgG response was restored to control level by the third week of secondary immunization. The glass microfiber-based whole blood histamine release assay demonstrated that various concentrations of the PS-64 extract did not influence histamine release induced either by anti-IgE or by specific allergens from basophils derived from whole blood of allergen-sensitized patients. Using the hemolytic plaque assay, significant suppression of IgM-secreting cell formation was noted in (CBAxC57BL/6)F1 mice administered various doses of the PS-64 extract before immunization. The PS-64 extract inhibited the in vitro proliferation of human mononuclear cells upon stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In a dose-dependent manner, the PS-64 extract also inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and skin graft rejection, similar to the effect noted with usage of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in (CBAxC57BL/6)F1 mice. Our investigation suggests that the immunomodulatory effects of PS-64 should be studied further for potential clinical therapeutic utility.

TI  - Partial characterization of the auxiliary factors involved in apolipoprotein B mRNA editing through APOBEC-1 affinity chromatography.  
AB  - APOBEC-1-catalyzed apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing requires auxiliary factors, but the number and functions of these factors are unknown. We have partially purified the editing activity from extracts of a McArdle cell line overexpressing His6-hemagglutinin-tagged, rat APOBEC-1 using metal-chelating affinity chromatography. The 1,200-fold purification achieved by this approach was partially dependent on exogenously added RNA containing a mooring sequence for editosome assembly. Affinity-purified editing activity could be separated by 300 mM NaCl extraction into two fractions, a salt-resistant fraction (editing fraction 1; EF1) and a salt-soluble fraction (EF2). Neither EF1 nor EF2 alone could edit apoB RNA, but when added together they reconstituted full editing activity. Previously identified candidate auxiliary factors including the p66/p44 apoB RNA binding proteins and the presumptive editosome assembly factor p240 were all present in the affinity-purified editing complex. Moreover, virtually all of p66, p240, and APOBEC-1 were present in EF1, whereas p44 was quantitatively recovered in EF2. This is the first demonstration that p66 and p44 can bind to apoB RNA independently of one another. In addition, 100- and 55-kDa apoB RNA cross-linking proteins have been identified in the APOBEC-1 affinity-purified material. RNA competition studies demonstrated that p100, p66, and p55 bound selectively to apoB RNA, whereas p44 had general RNA cross-linking characteristics. The data underscore the multiplicity of auxiliary factors potentially involved in apoB RNA editing and suggest an editosome far more complicated than may have been previously appreciated.

TI  - Phosphorylation by neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase promotes dimerization of Tau protein in vitro.  
AB  - In Alzheimer's disease, the microtubule-associated protein tau forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) that are the major structural component of neurofibrillary tangles. Although tau isolated from PHFs (PHF-tau) is abnormally phosphorylated, the role of this abnormal phosphorylation in PHF assembly is not known. Previously, neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) was shown to phosphorylate tau on sites that are abnormally phosphorylated in PHF-tau (Paudel, H. K., Lew, J., Ali, Z., and Wang, J. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23512-23518). In this study, phosphorylation by NCLK was found to promote dimerization of recombinant human tau (R-tau) and brain tau (B-tau) purified from brain extract. Chemical cross-linking by disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a homobifunctional chemical cross-linker that specifically cross-linked R-tau dimers, and a Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography revealed that R-tau preparations contain mixtures of monomeric and dimeric R-tau species. When the structure of NCLK-phosphorylated R-tau was studied by a similar approach, DSS preferentially cross-linked the phosphorylated R-tau over the nonphosphorylated R-tau, and the phosphorylated R-tau eluted as a dimeric species from the gel filtration column. Phosphorylated R-tau became resistant to DSS upon dephosphorylation and was recovered as a monomeric species from the gel filtration column. In the presence of a low concentration of dithiothreitol (1.65 microM), R-tau formed disulfide cross-linked R-tau dimers. When compared, phosphorylated R-tau formed more disulfide cross-linked dimers than the nonphosphorylated R-tau. B-tau also was specifically cross-linked to dimers by DSS. When B-tau and NCLK-phosphorylated B-tau were treated with DSS, phosphorylated B-tau was preferentially cross-linked over nonphosphorylated counterpart. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation by NCLK promotes dimerization and formation of disulfide cross-linked tau dimers, which is suggested to be the key step leading to PHF assembly (Schweers, O., Mandelkow, E.-M., Biernat, J., and Mandelkow, E. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 8463-8467).

AB  - Fifteen variants with >/=30-fold resistance to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea were isolated from the Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cell line. Eight had received a single treatment with a highly cytotoxic dose. The remainder, including the previously described RajiF12 cell line, arose following multiple exposures to initially moderate but escalating doses. Surprisingly, methylation resistance arose in three clones by reactivation of a previously silent O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene. Five clones, including RajiF12, displayed the microsatellite instability and increased spontaneous mutation rates at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus, consistent with deficiencies in mismatch repair. Defects in either the hMutSalpha or hMutLalpha mismatch repair complexes were identified in extracts of these resistant clones by in vitro complementation using extracts from colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Defects in hMutLalpha were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Remarkably, five methylation-resistant clones in which mismatch repair defects were demonstrated by biochemical assays did not exhibit significant microsatellite instability.

TI  - DNA replication and postreplication mismatch repair in cell-free extracts from cultured human neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells.  
AB  - DNA synthesis and postreplication mismatch repair were measured in vitro using cell-free extracts from cultured human SY5Y neuroblastoma and WI38 fibroblast cells in different growth states. All extracts, including differentiated SY5Y and quiescent WI38 fibroblasts, catalyzed SV40 origin-dependent DNA synthesis, totally dependent on SV40 T-antigen. Thus, although differentiated neuroblastoma and quiescent fibroblasts cells were essentially nondividing, their extracts were competent for DNA replication using DNA polymerases delta, alpha, and possibly epsilon, with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Nonreplicative DNA synthesis and lesion bypass by either alpha- or beta-polymerases were detected independently in extracts using primed or gapped single-stranded DNA templates. Long-patch postreplication mismatch repair was measured for the first time in neuroblastoma cell-free extracts.  Extracts from subconfluent and high-density SY5Y cells catalyzed postreplication mismatch repair with efficiencies comparable to those of HeLa cell extracts. No significant differences were observed in repair between SY5Y differentiated and undifferentiated cell extracts. Mismatch repair efficiencies were threefold lower in extracts from subconfluent WI38 cells, and repair in WI38 quiescent cells was fourfold less than in subconfluent cells, suggesting that mismatch repair may be regulated. The spectrum of mismatch repair in SY5Y extracts closely resembled the mismatch removal specificities of HeLa extracts: T . G and G . G mismatches were repaired most efficiently; C . A, A . A, A . G and a five-base loop were repaired with intermediate efficiency; repair of G . A, C . C, and T . T mismatches was extremely inefficient.

TI  - Progressive changes in cortical metabolites at three stages of infantile hydrocephalus studied by in vitro NMR spectroscopy.  
AB  - Infantile hydrocephalus is most often caused by an obstruction in the cerebrospinal fluid flow pathway and results in ventricular dilatation and chronic trauma to the surrounding brain. Surgical treatment alleviates the condition but does not cure or prevent neurological deficits. The H-Tx rat has severe hydrocephalus due to a spontaneous aqueduct obstruction in late gestation. In order to determine how hydrocephalus affects brain metabolism in tissue adjacent to the expanded ventricles, cortical extracts have been made from groups of hydrocephalic and control littermates with early, intermediate, and advanced hydrocephalus at 4, 11, and 21 days after birth.  Extracts were analyzed with 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy and metabolite peaks were quantified using an external standard. Metabolite concentrations were calculated relative to tissue wet weight and subsequently expressed relative to tissue dry weight, using values for water content obtained from additional groups of rats. In early hydrocephalus there was a significant decrease in the phosphomonoester phosphorylcholine, and there were small, nonsignificant changes in other compounds. By 11 days, in addition to phosphomonoesters, there were significant decreases in ATP, phosphocreatine, and in inorganic phosphate, but with no change in lactate. By 21 days there were also substantial decreases in cholines, inositol, creatine, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, N-acetylaspartate, alanine, and taurine. It is concluded that the sequence of pathological events starts with changes in membrane lipids. This is followed by reductions in energy metabolite which leads to cell swelling with loss of intracellular osmolytes and neurotransmitters. These changes are discussed in relation to hydrocephalus pathophysiology and to prevention and reversibility with shunt treatment.

TI  - In vitro effect of garlic powder extract on lipid content in normal and atherosclerotic human aortic cells.  
AB  - In the present study, the mechanism of the in vitro effect of garlic powder extract (GPE) on lipid content of cultured human aortic cells was investigated. The addition of GPE abolished atherogenic blood serum-induced accumulation of free cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters in smooth muscle cells derived from uninvolved (normal) intima. In cells isolated from atherosclerotic plaque, GPE lowered these lipids. GPE inhibited lipid synthesis both in normal and atherosclerotic cells. It inhibited acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity that participates in the cholesteryl ester formation and stimulated cholesteryl ester hydrolase that degrades cholesteryl esters. This may explain the lipid reduction caused by GPE in atherosclerotic cells. GPE inhibited the uptake of modified low density lipoprotein and degradation of lipoprotein-derived cholesteryl esters, thus considerably reducing the intracellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters. This suggests the mechanism responsible for the prevention of lipid accumulation in aortic cells caused by atherogenic blood serum.

TI  - A method that allows the assembly of kinetochore components onto chromosomes condensed in clarified Xenopus egg extracts.  
AB  - Kinetochores are complex macromolecular structures that link mitotic chromosomes to spindle microtubules. Although a small number of kinetochore components have been identified, including the kinesins CENP-E and XKCM1 as well as cytoplasmic dynein, neither how these and other proteins are organized to produce a kinetochore nor their exact functions within this structure are understood. For this reason, we have developed an assay that allows kinetochore components to assemble onto discrete foci on in vitro-condensed chromosomes. The source of the kinetochore components is a clarified cell extract from Xenopus eggs that can be fractionated or immunodepleted of individual proteins. Kinetochore assembly in these clarified extracts requires preincubating the substrate sperm nuclei in an extract under low ATP conditions. Immunodepletion of XKCM1 from the extracts prevents the localization of kinetochore-associated XKCM1 without affecting the targeting of CENP-E and cytoplasmic dynein or the binding of monomeric tubulin to the kinetochore. Extension of this assay for the analysis of other components should help to dissect the protein-protein interactions involved in kinetochore assembly and function.

TI  - Effect of Alzheimer's brain extracts on dynein immunoreactivity in PC12 cells.  
AB  - The neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been suggested to occur as a consequence of microtubule disruption and subsequent loss of intracellular transport. Structural microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been investigated for their role in the etiology of AD, but dynein, a force-producing MAP which mediates intracellular transport, has not been examined. In this report, dynein (MAP1C) immunoreactivity in AD brain tissue homogenates was observed increased 3.7-fold compared with control brain homogenate preparations. Similarly, NGF-differentiated PC12 cells cultured in the presence of soluble extracts prepared from AD brain tissue homogenates, exhibited an approximate 15-fold increase in dynein immunoreactivity compared to that of control brain tissue extracts. In contrast, AD clarified extracts had little effect upon "kinesin-like" protein immunoreactivity increased (approximately 2-fold); whereas, tau immunoreactivity was observed to be moderately increased (5-fold) over that of control brain extract treated PC12 cells. Chemical dephosphorylation and alkaline phosphatase treatment of AD extract-treated PC12 cell lysate prior to Western blotting resulted in complete loss of immunoreactivity, suggesting the dynein being monitored is a phosphorylated isoform. Furthermore, treatment of clarified brain tissue extracts with trypsin and (NH4)2SO4 suggests the endogenous elements giving rise to increased PC12 cell dynein intermediate chain immunoreactivity to be proteinaceous in nature. The observed increase in dynein intermediate-chain dynein immunoreactivity following exposure of neuronal cells to endogenous elements of AD brain may be reflective of dynein-microtubular array differences. Such an approach may be useful in assessing the effect of endogenous biomolecules on retrograde axonal transport in neuronal culture models.

TI  - In humans at least 75% of insulin secretion arises from punctuated insulin secretory bursts.  
AB  - Detection of insulin secretory bursts in peripheral blood is hampered by hepatic insulin extraction, dilution in the systemic insulin pool, and time-delayed damping of secretory burst amplitude. Previous studies in dogs in vivo and other experiments in vitro have shown that approximately 70% of all insulin is released within distinct insulin secretory bursts. To establish a method for detection and quantification of pulsatile insulin release in humans on the basis of peripheral insulin concentration measurements, we used a high-sensitivity, -specificity, and -precision insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and optimized an established deconvolution methodology to quantify the frequency, mass, and amplitude of insulin secretory bursts as well as to estimate the relative contribution of pulsatile insulin release to overall insulin secretion. By use of minutely sampled serum insulin concentrations measured by a highly sensitive insulin ELISA and insulin kinetics of 2.8 min (first half-life), 5.0 min (second half-life), and a fractional slow component of 0.28, the deconvolved insulin secretion rates in 20 healthy subjects during glucose infusion (4.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) could be resolved into a series (4.7 +/- 0.1 min/pulse) of approximately symmetric insulin secretory bursts with a mean mass of 87 +/- 12 pmol.l-1 pulse-1 and a mean amplitude (maximal release rate) of 35 +/- 4.7 pmol.l-1.min-1. The relative contribution of pulsatile to overall insulin secretion was 75 +/- 1.6% (range 59-85%). We conclude that in vivo insulin secretion in humans during nominal glucose stimulation consists of a series of punctuated insulin secretory bursts accounting for > or = 75% of total insulin secretion.

TI  - An aqueous extract of the leaves of Chromolaena odorata (formerly Eupatorium odoratum) (Eupolin) inhibits hydrated collagen lattice contraction by normal human dermal fibroblasts.  
AB  - Chromolaena odorata (formerly Eupatorium odoratum) is used as a traditional medicine in Vietnam (Nghiem, 1992), where its Vietnamese common name is "co hoi." While it has been widely considered a weed by agriculturalists (Holm et al., 1991), the aqueous extract and the decoction from the leaves of this plant have been used throughout Vietnam for the treatment of soft tissue wounds, burn wounds, and skin infections. A number of clinical studies done by Vietnamese as well as foreign medical workers has demonstrated the efficacy of this extract on the wound-healing process. In this article, the effect of the Eupolin extract on hydrated collagen lattice contraction by human dermal fibroblasts, an in vitro model of wound contraction, is described. The significant inhibition of collagen gel contraction by Eupolin extract at 50 to 200 micrograms/ml is demonstrated in various concentrations of collagen. When the extract at 50 to 150 micrograms/ml was washed out of the lattices and replaced by fresh medium without Eupolin, the contraction of collagen by cells was resumed. The visualization of cells in the lattices by incubation in a tetrazolium salt for 2 h showed live cells at 50 to 150 micrograms/ml of extract. In contrast, all cells were killed in the higher extract doses of 300 or 400 micrograms/ml. These preliminary results showing the inhibitory effect of Eupolin extract on collagen contraction suggest that a clinical evaluation of its effect on wound contraction and scar quality should be made. This work illustrates that traditional remedies that are used by folk practitioners to improve healing can be examined in a scientific manner using in vitro wound-healing models. It could be that the synergistic properties of components of the natural extract contribute to the positive effects demonstrated on various wound-healing mechanisms.

TI  - Effect of aqueous extract of Commiphora opobalsamum on blood pressure and heart rate in rats.  
AB  - The cardiovascular effects of aqueous extracts from the branches of Commiphora opobalsamum tree were investigated. The intravenous administration of 4 mg/kg of the aqueous extract depressed systemic arterial blood pressure by 20% (P < 0.01) and reduced heart rate of anaesthetised rats by 14% (P < 0.05). The hypotensive and the bradycardiac effects were immediate and in a dose related manner. The hypotensive effect of C. opobalsamum was inhibited by the pretreatment with atropine sulfate (1-4 mg/kg). These results suggest that the hypotensive effect of C. opobalsamum is due to the activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.

TI  - Development of a supercritical fluid extraction method for determination of lipid classes and total fat in meats and its comparison with conventional methods.  
AB  - A method has been developed for the determination of total fat and lipid classes in meat using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). The results agreed well with results from the conventional Bligh and Dyer and Schmid, Bondzynski and Ratzlaff extraction methods. SFE has advantages compared to the latter methods of a low consumption of hazardous organic solvents and shorter extraction time. After investigation of several different conditions, the most rapid extraction was achieved by adding 1 ml of cyclohexane to a 0.5-g sample mixed with 1 g Hydromatrix in a 7-ml thimble. The optimized SFE parameters were: 370 bar, 50 degrees C, 8% ethanol modifier, 4 ml/min dynamic flow for 30 min and collection with a tube leading to a vial.

TI  - Small fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in synovial fluid and serum as markers for cartilage degradation.  
AB  - We determined the tissue distribution of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in man and evaluated COMP in synovial fluid (SF) and serum. COMP was purified from human articular cartilage. Polyclonal antibodies were used to detect COMP in tissue cryosections and protein extracts. COMP was determined quantitatively and qualitatively in SF and serum by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Knee joint SF was taken from nine cadaveric and six living controls, 52 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), 85 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 60 patients with other forms of inflammatory arthritis. The degradative potential of SF on native COMP was tested in vitro. The highest concentrations of COMP were measured in articular cartilage and meniscus, the lowest in rib and trachea. Compared with controls, the concentrations of COMP in SF and serum were elevated in 36 and 50% of the patients. A total of 84% of patients with RA and 60% of patients with other forms of inflammatory arthritis showed significant amounts of low-molecular-weight COMP fragments (50-70 kDa) in SF. In contrast, SF fragments were present in only 21% of the OA patients. Furthermore, 13% of SF taken from patients with RA or other forms of inflammatory arthritis were able to degrade COMP in vitro. Using inhibitors, the involvement of serine proteinases could be demonstrated in only 8% of the cases. Based on these results, the absolute levels of COMP in SF and serum, and its fragmentation pattern in SF, seem to be promising as markers of joint tissue metabolism.

TI  - Ibogaine and a total alkaloidal extract of Voacanga africana modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the rat parabrachial nucleus in vitro.  
AB  - Ibogaine is a natural alkaloid of Voacanga africana that is effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms and craving in drug addicts. As the synaptic and cellular basis of ibogaine's actions are not well understood, this study tested the hypothesis that ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the parabrachial nucleus using the nystatin perforated patch-recording technique. Ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract dose dependently, reversibly, and consistently attenuate evoked excitatory synaptic currents recorded in parabrachial neurons. The ED50 of ibogaine's effect is 5 microM, while that of Voacanga africana extract is 170 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations, ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract induce inward currents or depolarization that are accompanied by increases in evoked and spontaneous firing rate. The depolarization or inward current is also accompanied by an increase in input resistance and reverses polarity around 0 mV. The depolarization and synaptic depression were blocked by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. These results indicate that ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract 1) depolarize parabrachial neurons with increased excitability and firing rate; 2) depress non-NMDA receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission; 3) involve dopamine receptor activation in their actions. These results further reveal that the Voacanga africana extract has one-hundredth the activity of ibogaine in depressing synaptic responses. Thus, ibogaine and Voacanga africana extract may produce their central effects by altering dopaminergic and glutamatergic processes.

TI  - Development of bait formulations for control of intermediate hosts of African schistosome species.  
AB  - Exploration of methods of snail control indicated a need for a new method because many failures in control programmes are due to lack of contact between molluscicides and the target snail population. The incorporation of molluscicides inside food pellets that are attractive to and ingestible by the target snails is suggested. Different concentrations of alcoholic extracts of Ambrosia maritima, Cucumis prophetarum and Rhynchosia minima-molluscicides of plant origin-were compared with niclosamide (Bayluscide) which is a strong synthetic molluscicide. They were incorporated into attractive food pellets and the lethal doses were determined. The results showed that Biomphalaria alexandrina snails are sensitive to only bait formulations with low concentrations of molluscicides. Laboratory and semi-field trials were conducted to study the efficacy of the prepared bait formulations on Biomphalaria alexandrina snails. The stability of these bait formulations was studied and it was observed that their effectiveness was reduced after long storage periods (> 3 weeks). The results revealed that Ambrosia maritima was the most effective molluscicide.

AB  - Partial 18O-labeling of peptides has been applied to post-source decay experiments in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The ions which originate from the carboxyl terminus of a peptide partially retain 18O atoms which have readily been incorporated into the C-terminal carboxyl groups during enzymatic hydrolysis in a buffer containing 40 atom percent H218O. The isotopic resolution of singly charged precursor ions and their product ions obtained for peptides up to ca. 2800 Da has been achieved using the delayed extraction method, which permits the rapid identification and assignment of the 18O-labeled and non-labeled ion species in the PSD spectra. The results obtained from several 18O-labeled peptides, derived from an enzymatic digest, demonstrate the accuracy and reproducibility of the present method, which will be in widespread use for protein identification via database searching or for investigations of totally unknown proteins.

TI  - Functional interference between retinoic acid or steroid hormone receptors and the oncoprotein Fli-1.  
AB  - The Fli-1 protein is a member of the ets proto-oncogene family, whose overexpression is a consequence of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) integration in Friend erythroleukemic cells. We present evidence that Fli-1 and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha) can reciprocally repress one another's transcriptional activation. Overexpression of Fli-1 inhibits the retinoic acid-induced activation of genes carrying a functional retinoic acid response element (RARE). Conversely, RAR alpha is able to repress Fli-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Transfection analysis of RAR alpha and Fli-1 mutants in cultured cells demonstrate that the DNA binding domain of RAR alpha and the N-terminal region of Fli-1 are required for repression. Gel retardation analysis demonstrates that RAR alpha cannot bind to the Fli-1 binding site in the E74 promoter and the expression of Fli-1 does not affect RAR alpha binding to DNA. Furthermore, the data suggest an indirect interaction between Fli-1 and RAR alpha mediated by a 'bridging' factor(s) present in nuclear extracts from RM10 erythroleukemia cells. Fli-1 also interferes with the action of receptors for thyroid or glucocorticoid hormone in several hematopoietic cell lines. The RA-induced differentiation and decrease of cell proliferation was blocked in myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells overexpressing the N-terminal region of Fli-1 at physiological concentrations of RA. These data suggest that accumulation of Fli-1 can oppose the transcriptional activity of hormone receptors in hematopoietic cells.

TI  - A bioadhesive delivery system as an alternative to infiltration anesthesia.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a novel saliva-activated bioadhesive drug delivery system of lidocaine hydrochloride as a viable alternative to infiltration anesthesia in dentistry. STUDY DESIGN: The study was carried out in three stages. First, the drug delivery system (DDS) was subjectively evaluated for adherence to the gingival mucosa and peak effect of anesthesia. In the second stage, a comparative subjective and objective evaluation of the DDS with a marketed topical gel preparation was carried out. Finally an open label, nonblinded clinical trial was carried out using the exodontia model. A total of 49 extractions were attempted in 41 patients. The effect of the following variables was investigated in the study: (1) jaw (maxillary and mandibular), (2) overall mobility, (3) position-notation of tooth (1, 2, 3, 4 ...).  The positive extractions were statistically analyzed by the t test comparison of means of two independent variables. RESULTS: Subjective evaluation revealed that the DDS adheres to the gingiva within a minute and produces peak effect in 15 minutes. Comparative study revealed that the DDS produces greater depth of anesthesia than the marketed topical gel. Of 49 extractions attempted with the DDS, 40 were successful, giving an efficacy of 81.63%. CONCLUSION: The novel saliva-activated bioadhesive drug delivery system of lidocaine hydrochloride exhibits potential as a feasible alternative to infiltration anesthesia in dentistry.

TI  - Hemostatic treatment after tooth extraction in a patient with factor V deficiency.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Factor V deficiency is a very rare hereditary coagulation disorder and tooth extraction in the patient with factor V deficiency has not been reported except in one case. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: A 38-year-old woman with factor V deficiency was referred for extraction of the impacted lower third molar. After intravenous administration of frozen fresh plasma (FFP) and recognition of an increase of factor V level from 1-31%, upper and lower third molars were extracted. Eighteen and 48 h after the extraction, factor V was intermittently supplemented by injection of 4 and 2 units of FFP, respectively, and factor V was maintained above 12%. To form fast coagula and to protect the wound, the lower extraction socket was filled with a fibrin glue composed of factor XIII and fibrinogen (Beriplast P) and a plastic splint was applied. The wound was healed and epithelized within 2 weeks after the extraction without any bleeding or infectious consequences. CONCLUSION: Extraction in the patient with factor V hereditary deficiency is safely performed by both supplementation of factor V and application of local hemostasis.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed and tested for simultaneous extraction, elution and determination of doxorubicin and prochlorperazine content in human plasma samples. The procedure consists of extraction through a conditioned C18 solid-phase extraction cartridge, elution from a Spherisorb C8 reversed-phase column by an isocratic mobile phase (60% acetonitrile, 15% methanol and 25% buffer) followed by detection with electrochemical and fluorescence detectors.

The lower limits of quantitation for doxorubicin and prochlorperazine in plasma samples were 6.25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. A linear calibration curve was obtained for up to 2 microg/ml of doxorubicin and prochlorperazine. This combination method may be of particular value in clinical studies where phenothiazines such as prochlorperazine are used to enhance retention of doxorubicin in drug resistant tumor cells.

TI  - Wellness programs: a review of the evidence [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review studies that have examined an association between wellness programs and improvements in quality of life and to assess the strength of the scientific evidence. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was constructed with the following medical subject headings: "psychoneuroimmunology," "chronic disease" and "health promotion," "chronic disease" and "health behaviour," "relaxation techniques," "music therapy," "laughter," "anger," "mediation" and "behavioural medicine." Searches using the text words "wellness" and "wellness program" were also carried out. References from the primary articles identified in the search and contemporary writing on wellness were also considered. STUDY SELECTION: Selection was limited to randomized controlled trials or prospective studies published in English that involved human subjects and that took place between 1980 and 1996. All studies with an intervention aimed at promoting wellness and measuring outcomes were included, except studies of patients with cancer and HIV and studies of health promotion programs in the workplace. Of the 1082 references initially identified, 11 met the criteria for inclusion in the critical appraisal.  DATA EXTRACTION: The following information was extracted from the 11 studies: characteristics of the study population, number of participants (and number followed to completion), length of follow-up, type of intervention, outcome measures and results. All 11 studies were assessed for the quality of their evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: All studies reported some positive outcomes following the intervention in question, although many had limitations precluding applicability of the results to a wider population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the suggested benefit associated with wellness programs, the evidence was inconclusive. Whether the composition of the target group or the type of intervention has a role in determining outcomes is unknown. Although trends suggest that wellness programs may be cost-effective, further research is needed for confirmation.

TI  - The role of zinc lozenges in treatment of the common cold.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and critique the medical literature on the use of zinc lozenges for treatment of the common cold. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE searches (January 1966-June 1997) identified human clinical trials on the use of zinc lozenges for the treatment of the common cold. Bibliographies were also reviewed for relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of zinc lozenges in adults for the treatment of the common cold, with the clinical end points of reduction in duration and/or severity of cold symptoms.  DATA EXTRACTION: All double-blind placebo-controlled, human clinical trials on the use of zinc lozenges for the treatment of the common cold were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The use of zinc lozenges in the treatment of the common cold has been suggested to reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms. Of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, four found zinc lozenges to be effective, while the other four reported no difference between zinc and placebo therapy. Potential reasons for the discrepancy between the results of these trials include inadequate placebo control, formulation of the lozenge, and the dose of zinc used. Common adverse effects include unpleasant taste, mouth irritation, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of the common cold with zinc gluconate lozenges, using adequate doses of elemental zinc, may be effective in reducing duration and severity of cold symptoms. The benefit appears to be maximal if the lozenges are started immediately after the onset of symptoms. The formulation of the lozenges also appears to be important because the addition of citric acid or tartaric acid may reduce efficacy due to chelation of zinc ion. Although zinc gluconate lozenges have dominated clinical trials thus far, further studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges and to determine whether their adverse effect profile is more favorable to that of zinc gluconate lozenges. Patients should play an important role in the decision-making process and must decide whether the benefit gained from treatment with zinc lozenges outweighs the potential adverse effects.

TI  - Determination of butorphanol in horse race urine by immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  
AB  - An analytical procedure to screen butorphanol in horse race urine using ELISA kits and its confirmation by GC-MS is described. Urine samples (5 ml) were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and extracted by solid-phase extraction. The residues were then evaporated, derivatized and injected into the GC-MS system. The ELISA test (20 microl of sample) was able to detect butorphanol up to 104 h after the intramuscular administration of 8 mg of Torbugesic, and the GC-MS method detected the drug up to 24 h in FULL SCAN or 31 h in the SIM mode. Validation of the GC-MS method in the SIM mode using nalbuphine as internal standard included linearity studies (10-250 ng/ml), recovery (+/-100%), intra-assay (4.1-14.9%) and inter-assay (9.3-45.1%) precision, stability (10 days), limit of detection (10 ng/ml) and limit of quantitation (20 ng/ml).

TI  - Cloning and expression of a marine bacterial beta-galactoside alpha2,6-sialyltransferase gene from Photobacterium damsela JT0160.  
AB  - Sialyltransferase 0160, a bacterial sialyltransferase which catalyzes the incorporation of NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into the galactose residue of the carbohydrate chain at position 6, is produced by Photobacterium damsela JT0160. The gene coding for sialyltransferase 0160 (bst) was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The sialyltransferase 0160 gene contains an open reading frame of 2,028 base pairs encoding a protein of 675 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of sialyltransferase 0160 did not contain the sialylmotif and had no significant similarity to mammalian sialyltransferases.  Crude extracts of cultured E. coli MV1184 cells carrying an expression plasmid for the sialyltransferase 0160 gene showed sialyltransferase activity, which was identified as beta-galactoside alpha2,6-sialyltransferase activity by enzymatic reaction product analysis. In addition, when mutant genes, lacking 3'-coding regions for COOH-terminal portions of the protein, which are thought to form alpha-helix structures, were expressed in E. coli MV1184, soluble-form enzymes were obtained. This implies that the COOH-terminal portion of sialyltransferase 0160 is required for membrane binding.

AB  - Millimolar concentrations of ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate induced cytotoxicity against human glioblastoma T98G cells. Addition of hot water and sodium hydroxide extracts of the bark of Acer nikoense Maxim. synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic activity of ascorbate. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells were relatively resistant to ascorbate, the Acer nikoense Maxim. extract, or a combination of them. The extracts stimulated the degradation of ascorbates via ascorbyl radical production, in parallel with their ability to stimulate the cytotoxic activity of ascorbate. The results suggest the medicinal efficacy of the Acer nikoense Maxim. extracts.

TI  - The chromosomal effect of birchen dust as determined by the micronucleus test.  
AB  - In a wood processing factory, the measured air concentration of birchen dust was 1.26 +/- 0.41 mg/m3, and the micronucleus frequency of peripheral blood lymphocytes in 83 workers exposed to wood dust was 1.13 +/- 2.83/1000, which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of control group (0.51 +/- 1.41/1000). The number of exposed workers with positive micronucleus test was 9.6%, which was higher than that of control group (4.5%), but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). The micronucleus test in mice treated with water extracts of unsteamed and unbaked birchen dust showed that the micronucleus frequencies in all treated groups were significantly higher than that of control group (P < 0.01) and there was also a dose response correlation (r = 0.96, P < 0.0005). The results of steamed and baked birchen dust extracts were significantly lower than those of the unsteamed and unbaked ones at the same doses (P < 0.001). This suggests that when the birchen dust is steamed at the temperature of 100 degrees C for 24 h or baked at the temperature of 80 degrees C, its inducing effect in micronucleus test could be lowered.

TI  - Rheologic characterization of vegetal lectins by dissociation of induced erythrocyte agglutinates.  
AB  - Energy evolved from hemagglutination reaction or spent in dissociating erythrocyte agglutinates has been proved to be an excellent parameter for analyzing cell-cell interactions mediated by bridging molecules such as antibodies or lectins. We developed a new rheo-optical method to estimate the energy of dissociation of red blood cell agglutinates. In a Couette shear field agglutinates can be dissociated until a suspension of monodispersed cells is obtained. Intensity of light backscattered by suspended agglutinates increases during their mechanical dissociation. Variation of backscattered light intensity correlates with the energy spent in the process. The adhesive energy of erythrocyte agglutination induced by lectins has been estimated by applying this method. Two specific lectins (Dolichus Biflorus agglutinin and Ulex Europaeus agglutinin) and a new lectin obtained from Amarantus Cruentus seeds which specificity is unknown were studied. Results obtained in this work for Dolichus Biflorus lectin are comparable with values published by other authors. An asymptotic decrease of adhesive energy was observed when the mechanical dissociation was applied several times on the same sample. Our results suggest that the cell detachment is accompanied by the extraction of membrane receptors. This finding is consistent with results obtained by other authors.

TI  - Light-induced cell death of retinal photoreceptors in the absence of p53.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Cell death by apoptosis is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis, and it is involved also in a variety of pathologic processes. Apoptosis is the final common pathway of photoreceptor cell death in retinal dystrophies and degeneration. So far, little is known about genes regulating apoptosis in the retina. The tumor-suppressor gene product p53 is a potent regulator of apoptosis in numerous systems. However, p53-independent apoptotic pathways also have been described. In this study the authors investigated the role of p53 in the light-induced apoptosis of retinal photoreceptors using mice lacking p53. METHODS: Free-moving p53-/- and p53+/+ mice were dark adapted and were exposed to 8,500 or 15,000 lux of diffuse, cool, white fluorescent light for 2 hours. Animals were killed before and immediately after light exposure or at 12 hours in darkness after light exposure. Eyes were enucleated and processed for light and electron microscopy and histochemistry (TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling method). Isolated retinas were subjected to the extraction of total retinal DNA. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed at all time points. RESULTS: Morphologic, biochemical, histochemical, and ERG analysis showed that the retinas of untreated p53-/- mice and wild-type control mice were structurally and functionally indistinguishable. After exposure to diffuse white fluorescent light, light-induced photoreceptor cell death was analyzed and was found to be the same in both groups of mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that light-induced apoptosis of photoreceptors is independent of functional p53.

TI  - Unknown peptide sequencing using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and in-source decay.  
AB  - The results of a study to determine the utility of in-source decay fragmentation of matrix-assisted laser-desorbed ions for obtaining useful sequence information on unknown peptides are presented. Six peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and submitted as single blind unknowns. The in-source decay fragment ion data were collected on a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with delayed extraction. These fragment ion data were manually interpreted on the basis of known fragmentation pathways to determine a proposed sequence. The proposed sequences for three of the unknowns were essentially correct, with a few minor errors. A fourth unknown had significant errors associated with its proposed sequence due to misinterpretation of the fragmentation data. Two unknowns were found to have undergone significant sample degradation prior to analysis, which compromised the results for these samples. An example of the use of protein database searching of a partial peptide sequence to aid in a sequence determination is also presented.

TI  - From famine to feast: the role of methylglyoxal production in Escherichia coli.  
AB  - The enzyme methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) was partially purified from Escherichia coli extracts, and the amino-terminal sequence of candidate proteins was determined, based on the native protein being a tetramer of about 69 kDa. Database analysis identified an open reading frame in the E. coli genome, YccG, corresponding to a protein of 16.9 kDa. When amplified and expressed from a controlled promoter, it yielded extracts that contained high levels of MGS activity. MGS expressed from the trc promoter accumulated to approximately 20% of total cell protein, representing approximately 900-fold enhanced expression. This caused no detriment during growth on glucose, and the level of methylglyoxal (MG) in the medium rose to only 0.08 mM. High-level expression of MGS severely compromised growth on xylose, arabinose and glycerol. A mutant lacking MGS was constructed, and it grew normally on a range of carbon sources and on low-phosphate medium. However, the mutant failed to produce MG during growth on xylose in the presence of cAMP, and growth was inhibited.

TI  - Momordica charantia (Bitter Gourd) peel, pulp, seed and whole fruit extract inhibits mouse skin papillomagenesis.  
AB  - The present study was designed to elucidate the inhibitory potential of Momordica charantia (Bitter Gourd) peel, pulp, seed and whole fruit extract on mouse skin papillomagensis with the modulatory influence of biotransformation system enzymes. Topical application of Momordica whole fruit extract (100 microl/animal per day) during the peri-initiation stage (1 week before and 2 weeks after initiation) by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and/or during the tumor promotion stage reduced the (i) tumor burden to 4.26, 3.72 and 3.11 (positive control value: 5.42); (ii) cumulative number of papillomas to 81, 67 and 53 (positive control value: 103); and (iii) percent incidence of mice bearing papillomas to 100, 94 and 94, respectively (positive control value: 100). In a comparison of the anticarcinogenic efficacy of Momordica peel, pulp, seed and whole fruit extract (100 microl/animal per day), after topical treatment during the peri-initiation and during the tumor promotion stage, revealed the modulation of the (i) tumor burden (tumors/mouse) to 3.06, 3.61, 3.17 and 3.11; (ii) cumulative number of papillomas to 49, 65, 54 and 53; and (iii) percent incidence of mice bearing papillomas to 84, 100, 94 and 94, respectively. Significant elevation in the sulfhydryl (-SH) level was observed in the liver and skin tissues by the topical treatment of Momordica peel, pulp, seed and whole fruit extract. Elevation in the hepatic levels of cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST) and microsomal cytochrome b, was also observed by the topical treatment of Momordica peel, seed and whole fruit extract. The results suggest the maximum chemopreventive potential is in the Momordica peel. Equivocal efficacy is in the Momordica seed and whole fruit extract. Biotransformation system enzymes may be the cause of this reduced papillomagenesis.

TI  - Arterial and pulmonary arterial concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine after epidural injection in elderly patients.  
AB  - Bupivacaine HCl is a 50:50 racemic mixture of the levo [S(-)] and dex [R(+)] enantiomers. The R(+) enantiomer exhibits greater cardiac tissue binding and toxicity. To determine whether the lung exhibits selective uptake of one of the enantiomers of bupivacaine, we measured pulmonary artery and radial artery blood concentrations of the two enantiomers after a lumbar epidural injection of 20 mL of 0.75% bupivacaine in 10 elderly patients undergoing one-stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Significantly lower concentrations of R(+) than S(-) were noted in both pulmonary artery and arterial blood. Both enantiomers were absorbed by the lung to a similar extent within the first 5 min after epidural injection (extraction ratio approximately equal to 0.1 or 10%). Mean time of maximal concentration (Tmax) was 6 min. In 3 of the 10 patients, Tmax occurred in 1-3 min. We conclude that the lung absorbs both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of bupivacaine to a similar extent after epidural injection and that this is of doubtful clinical significance. This study also suggests that peak concentrations of bupivacaine may occur earlier after epidural injection in certain elderly patients than previously believed. Implications: In the first 5 min after epidural injection, approximately 10% of the local anesthetic bupivacaine was absorbed by the lung. Absorption of the two enantiomers (mirror images) of bupivacaine were similar. Lung absorption of bupivacaine is unlikely to influence local anesthetic toxicity.

TI  - Method of purification affects some interfacial properties of pulmonary surfactant proteins B and C and their mixtures with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.  
AB  - Two methods were employed for preparation of lipid extracts from porcine lung surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C were isolated from the extracts using gel-exclusion chromatography on LH-60 with chloroform:methanol acidified with hydrochloric acid. Monolayers of pure SP-B or SP-C isolated from butanol lipid extracts spread at the air-water interface showed larger molecular areas than those determined in films of SP-B or SP-C isolated from chloroform surfactant extracts. Aqueous dispersions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) supplemented with 2.5 and 5.0 wt% of SP-B or SP-C obtained from butanol extracts adsorbed faster to the air-water interface than their counterparts reconstituted with proteins isolated from chloroform extracts. Surface pressure-area characteristics of spread monolayers of DPPC plus SP-B or SP-C did not depend on the method of isolation of the proteins. The diagrams of the mean molecular areas vs. composition for the monolayers of DPPC plus SP-B or SP-C showed positive deviations from the additivity rule, independently of the procedure used for preparation of lipid extract surfactant. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectrometry of the proteins isolated from different extraction solvents was consistent with some differences in the chemical compositions of SP-Bs. Butylation of SP-B during extraction of surfactant pellet with butanol may account for the differences observed in the molecular masses of SP-Bs isolated by the two different extraction protocols. The study suggests that the method of purification of SP-B and SP-C may modify their ability to enhance the adsorption rates of DPPC/protein mixtures, and this may be relevant to the formulation of protein-supplemented lipids for exogenous treatment of pulmonary surfactant insufficiency.

TI  - Complete replication of human sperm genome in egg extracts from Xenopus laevis.  
AB  - To examine the ability of Xenopus egg extracts to support a complete replication cycle of human sperm genome, demembranated human spermatozoa were incubated with the extract from activated Xenopus laevis eggs. Most sperm heads were decondensed within 15 min. The heads became round within 30 min with diameters of 10-30 microns. The process of DNA replication in the pronuclei was monitored by two methods, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and flow cytometry. The results indicate that DNA replication was initiated approximately 1.5 h after membrane structure formation and that it lasted up to 9 h. The amounts of DNA in most pronuclei were doubled by 4-9 h, depending on which donor toad was the source of the egg extract. Inclusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml), had no obvious effect on human sperm DNA replication but appeared to prevent the pronuclei from degradation after a prolonged period (> 6 h) of incubation. After storage in liquid nitrogen for > 1.5 mo, the efficiency of the egg extracts in supporting sperm head decondensation and DNA replication was reduced for human sperm but not for Xenopus sperm. Possible applications of the use of Xenopus egg extract for human sperm activation and DNA replication are discussed.

TI  - Signalling pathways involved in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in rat hepatocytes.  
AB  - In hepatocytes glycogen storage is stimulated by insulin and this effect of insulin is counteracted by epidermal growth factor (EGF). The mechanism by which insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis in liver is unknown. We investigated the involvement of candidate protein kinases in insulin signalling in hepatocytes. Both insulin and EGF activated extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK-2), p70rsk and protein kinase B (PKB) and inactivated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Whereas EGF caused a greater activation of ERK-2 than insulin, the converse was true for PKB. The stimulation by insulin of ERK-2 was blocked by a mitogen-activated protein (MEK) inhibitor (PD 98059) and of p70rsk by rapamycin. However, these inhibitors, separately or in combination, did not block the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin, indicating that activation of these kinases is not essential for the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. Mono Q fractionation of hepatocyte extracts resolved a single myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase peak from extracts of EGF-treated cells (peak 1, eluting at 200 mmol/l NaCl) and two peaks from insulin-treated cells (peak 1 eluting at 200 mmol/l NaCl and peak 2 eluting at 400 mmol/l NaCl). In the combined presence of insulin and EGF, activation of peak 2 was abolished. In situ MBP kinase assays and immunoblotting established that peak 1 coincides with ERK-2 and peak 2 is not an activated form of ERK-1 or ERK-2. It is concluded that PKB, which is activated to a greater extent by insulin than EGF, and peak 2, which is activated by insulin and counteracted by EGF, are possible candidates in mediating the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin.

TI  - An HPLC assay utilizing solid-phase extraction for CI-1010, an alkylating radiosensitizer, in rat plasma.  
AB  - CI-1010, a 2-nitroimidazole, is a chiral prodrug for the active moiety PD 146923 and is under development as an alkylating radiosensitizer to be used as an adjuvant to radiotherapy. Because CI-1010 has an estimated half-life < or = 2 min under physiological conditions its metabolites/degradation products PD 146415, an inactive moiety, and PD 146923 were assayed to support rat toxicology studies. The method involves the processing of plasma samples through phenyl solid-phase extraction cartridges followed by chromatography on CN columns with UV detection at 325 nm. The assay appears linear over the range 0.050-100 micrograms ml-1 for both PD 146415 and PD 146923. Interrun accuracy and precision estimates for PD 146415 and PD 146923 were within +/- 6.50 and < or = 3.27%, respectively, and +/- 12.8 and < or = 4.06%, respectively, for quality controls containing nominal concentrations of 0.400, 4.00 and 40.0 micrograms ml-1. The absolute recovery of CI-1010, PD 146415 and internal standard, PD 126675, were approximately 40, 96 and 95%, respectively. The recovery of PD 146923 appeared concentration dependent and ranged from 68 to 92%. PD 146415 and PD 146923 were both stable in rat plasma at 4 degrees C and -77 degrees C for at least 7 h and 154 days, respectively. CI-1010 was not stable in rat plasma at 4 degrees C. CI-1010, PD 146415 and PD 126675 were stable for at least 63 days in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 3.0 and 4 degrees C. Under identical conditions PD 146923 was stable for only 8 days. The applicability of this method to determine concentrations of PD 146415 and PD 146923 in rat plasma is reported in this paper.

TI  - Increased somatic recombination in methylation tolerant human cells with defective DNA mismatch repair.  
AB  - We have studied whether spontaneous intrachromosomal recombination is altered in methylation tolerant human cells with a defect in mismatch repair. Somatic recombination was analysed in HeLaMR cells containing the vector pTPSN, which carries two copies of the gene for hygromycin resistance. The hygromycin genes are both inactivated by an inserted HindIII linker but hygromycin-resistant clones can arise by recombination. The spontaneous rate of recombination in a clone of HeLaMR cells containing a single integrated copy of pTPSN (HeLaG1) was 3.1x10(-6)/cell per generation. Two methylation tolerant variants from HeLaG1 cells (clone 12 and clone 15) were isolated by exposure to MNNG. Clone 12 cells exhibited a 16-fold increase in spontaneous mutation rate at the HPRT gene and extensive microsatellite instability at both mono- and dinucleotide repeats. Microsatellite instability limited to mononucleotide repeats was found in clone 15, whereas the mutation rate at HPRT was not significantly affected. A mismatch binding defect in extracts of clone 15 could be complemented by exogenous GTBP but not by purified hMSH2 protein. These data suggest that clone 15 is defective in GTBP. Extracts of clone 12 were unable to correct a single C:T mispair and complementation by extracts of human colorectal carcinoma cells with known deficiencies in mismatch repair indicated a defect in hMutLalpha. Western blotting with antibodies against different human mismatch repair proteins showed that clone 12 cells did not express hPMS2 protein, but expression of hMLH1, hMSH2 and GTBP appeared normal. The spontaneous recombination rate of clone 12 was 19-fold higher than the parental HeLaG1 cells, whereas no increase was observed in clone 15. Analysis of individual recombinants showed that hygromycin resistance arose exclusively by gene conversion. Our data indicate that mismatch correction regulates somatic recombination in human cells.

TI  - Cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic activities of red ginseng.  
AB  - Red ginseng extract A and B are the active components of Panax ginseng. Red ginseng is a classical traditional Chinese medicine. Among Chinese herbs, red ginseng has been considered as one of the tonics. Many studies indicated that red ginseng could enhance immune function of the human body. The effects of red ginseng extracts on transplantable tumors, proliferation of lymphocyte, two-stage model and rat liver lipid peroxidation were studied. In a two-stage model, red ginseng extracts had a significant cancer chemoprevention. At 50-400 mg/kg, they could inhibit DMBA/Croton oil-induced skin papilloma in mice, decrease the incidence of papilloma, prolong the latent period of tumor occurrence and reduce tumor number per mouse in a dose-dependent manner. Red ginseng extract B could effectively inhibit the Fe2+/cysteine-induced lipid peroxidation of rat liver microsome, suggesting that red ginseng extract B has a stronger antioxidative effect than that of extract A. The results indicated that red ginseng extracts (50 approximately 400 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit the growth of transplantable mouse sarcoma S180 and melanoma B16. Red ginseng extracts A (0.5 mg/ml) and B (0.1 and 0.25 mg/ml) might effectively promote the transformation of T lymphocyte, but there was no influence on lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by concanavalin A. This suggests that red ginseng extracts have potent tumor therapeutic activity and improve the cell immune system.

TI  - Development and validation of methods for the trace determination of PCBs in biological matrices.  
AB  - A method was developed to determine trace concentrations of a range of individual PCB congeners in biological samples (grass, silage, cattle faeces and milk-fat) which were taken from rural or 'background' areas of the UK, in order to prepare a mass balance of PCBs in grazing, lactating cows. A simple milk-fat extraction method was compared to Soxhlet extraction and to whole milk extraction. Results indicated that simply boiling milk-fat in hexane with sodium sulphate present gave a comparable extraction of PCBs to other methods. A clean-up method was devised using acid treated silica gel followed by basic alumina chromatography. Grinding frozen grass or silage with sodium sulphate followed by Soxhlet extraction was found to be the most effective method for these matrices, whilst avoiding the potential contamination/loss of PCBs which can be incurred by air, oven or freeze drying. Soxhlet extraction of cattle faeces, after grinding with sodium sulphate, was found to be effective. A rigorous clean-up was devised which involved passing the extracts through silica gel and acid treated silica gel, followed by size exclusion chromatography (gel permeation chromatography, SEC). 13C12 labelled PCBs were used as recovery standards, quantification was performed using GC-MS. A quality control regime and method validation results are presented. The milk analysis method gave within batch mean recoveries of 69-96%, and within batch standard deviations between 1 and 10%. The vegetation analysis method gave within batch mean recoveries of 91-116%, and within batch standard deviations between 1 and 11%. The batch to batch mean recovery for milk analysis was 90%, with an RSD of 2% for high spikes and 5% for low spikes; for vegetation analysis the batch to batch average recovery was 106%, with an RSD of 14% for high spikes and 11% for low spikes. sigma PCB concentrations (53 congeners) of 3900 +/- 790 pg g-1 milk-fat, 1300 +/- 420 pg g-1 dry matter (DM) cattle faeces, 630 +/- 140 pg g-1 DM silage and 1350 +/- 580 pg g-1 DM grass were found during the study.

TI  - Inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases by an alkaloid fraction from Helietta apiculata markedly potentiate the hypnotic action of pentobarbital.  
AB  - Crude alkaloid fraction (CAF) isolated from the leaves of Helietta apiculata showed the presence of furoquinolines. The extract was investigated to determine if it can enhance the sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS) to the hypnotic action of pentobarbital. Administration of CAF to mice in a dose range of 300-500 mg/kg prior to an injection of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p.) was associated with a statistically significant decrease of sleep latency and prolongation of pentobarbital-induced sleeping time. Pretreatment of rats with the same alkaloid extract (150 mg/kg, i.p. for 4 days) prior to administration of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.p.) caused not only significant reduction of the levels of microsomal proteins, total cytochrome P450 enzymes and a decrease of aminopyrin-N-demethylation and 3,4-benz(a)pyrene hydroxylation but also changed the pattern of cytochrome P450. It is concluded that the CAF isolated from H. apiculata can potentiate the CNS depressant effect of pentobarbital due to alteration of barbiturate metabolism through inhibition, mainly, of cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes.

TI  - Epidemiology of human rabies in the United States, 1980 to 1996.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To summarize the epidemiologic, diagnostic, and clinical features of the 32 laboratory-confirmed cases of human rabies diagnosed in the United States from 1980 to 1996. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained from case reports of human rabies submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by state or local health authorities. STUDY SELECTION: All cases of human rabies reported in the United States from 1980 to 1996 in which infection with rabies virus was confirmed by laboratory studies.  DATA EXTRACTION: Patients were reviewed for demographic characteristics, exposure history, rabies prophylaxis, clinical presentation, treatment, clinical course, diagnostic laboratory tests, identification of rabies virus variants, and the number of medical personnel or family members who required postexposure prophylaxis after coming in contact with an exposed person. DATA SYNTHESIS: 32 cases of human rabies were reported from 20 states. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 82 years and were predominantly male (63%). Most patients (25 of 32) had no definite history of an animal bite or other event associated with rabies virus transmission. Of the 32 cases, 17 (53%) were associated with rabies virus variants found in insectivorous bats, 12 (38%) with variants found in domestic dogs outside the United States, 2 (6%) with variants found in indigenous domestic dogs, and 1 (3%) with a variant found in indigenous skunks. Among the 7 patients with a definite exposure history, 6 cases were attributable to dog bites received in foreign countries and 1 was attributable to a bat bite received in the United States. In 12 of the 32 patients (38%), rabies was not clinically suspected and was diagnosed after death. In the remaining 20 cases (63%), the diagnosis of rabies was considered before death and samples were obtained specifically for laboratory confirmation a median of 7 days (range, 3 to 17 days) after the onset of clinical signs. Of the clinical differences between patients in whom rabies was diagnosed before death and those in whom it was diagnosed after death, the presence of hydrophobia or aerophobia was significantly associated with antemortem diagnosis (odds ratio, 11.0 [95% CI, 1.05 to 273.34]). The median number of medical personnel or familial contacts of the patients who received postexposure prophylaxis was 54 per patient (range, 4 to 179). None of the 32 patients with rabies received postexposure prophylaxis before the onset of clinical disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, human rabies is rare but probably underdiagnosed. Rabies should be included in the differential diagnosis of any case of acute, rapidly progressing encephalitis, even if the patient does not recall being bitten by an animal. In addition to situations involving an animal bite, a scratch from an animal, or contact of mucous membranes with infectious saliva, postexposure prophylaxis should be considered if the history indicates that a bat was physically present, even if the person is unable to reliably report contact that could have resulted in a bite. Such a situation may arise when a bat bite causes an insignificant wound or the circumstances do not allow recognition of contact, such as when a bat is found in the room of a sleeping person or near a previously unattended child.

TI  - The effect of ionic strength on liposome-buffer and 1-octanol-buffer distribution coefficients.  
AB  - The distribution of salmeterol and proxicromil between unilamellar vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and aqueous buffer at pH 7.4 has been studied, using an ultrafiltration method, as a function of compound concentration, DOPC concentration, and buffer ionic strength. The binding of these ionized lipophilic compounds to neutral DOPC vesicles induces a surface charge, which causes the observed membrane distribution coefficient D(mem)obs to vary significantly with bound compound to DOPC ratio and with ionic strength. This variability is shown to be well-described with use of the Gouy-Chapman theory of the ionic double layer and is contrasted with the ideal behavior shown by the neutral compound clofibrate. Increasing ionic strength is also shown to increase the observed 1-octanol-buffer distribution coefficients D(o/w)obs of proxicromil but through a very different mechanism involving the extraction of ion pairs. This study highlights the experimental difficulty in determining concentration-independent liposome distribution coefficients of ionized lipophilic compounds and describes when deviations will be significant and how observed values may be corrected for such effects. The general effect of ionic strength on membrane-buffer distribution and 1-octanol-buffer distribution is discussed with particular reference to the very different propensity for ion pair formation shown by the two systems, and the most suitable experimental conditions that should be used with each system.

TI  - Ligand- and nuclear factor-dependent change in hydrophobicity of thyroid hormone beta1 receptor.  
AB  - An aqueous two-phase partitioning assay was performed using in vitro translated human thyroid hormone beta1 receptor (TRbeta1). Wild-type TRbeta1 was less hydrophobic in the presence of both triiodothyronine (T3) and nuclear extract. This reflects a conformational change, or change in electrostatic properties, of the TRbeta1-nuclear factor complex as a result of T3 binding. Mutant TRbeta1s with reduced T3 binding affinity required a higher concentration of T3 for the shift of hydrophobicity, and a mutant without T3 binding activity did not show any shift, even in the presence of 1 mM T3. The unique mutant receptor, R243Q, has impaired transcriptional function despite virtually normal binding affinity for T3. When this mutant was examined in this assay, the shift of hydrophobicity was significantly impaired even in the presence of both nuclear extract and a high concentration of T3. Nuclear extract of COS1 cells did not affect the T3-binding affinity of R243Q. These results indicate that the R243Q mutant has impaired a ligand-dependent conformational change and interaction with nuclear factor(s). Inability of R243Q to interact normally with nuclear factor(s) may explain, in part, the molecular mechanism of discordance between ligand binding and transactivation function of this mutant.

TI  - Differential regulation and transcriptional control of immediate early gene expression in forskolin-treated WEHI7.2 thymoma cells.  
AB  - Agents that increase intracellular cAMP are frequently growth inhibitory for lymphocytes and induce apoptosis in cortical thymocytes by regulating gene expression. In the present study, immediate early gene expression was examined in WEHI7.2 thymoma cells undergoing cAMP-mediated apoptosis. Temporal differences in c-fos, junB, and inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) steady-state mRNA levels were observed after forskolin exposure. Maximal induction of c-fos and junB occurred within 1 h, returning to basal levels by 3.5 h. In contrast, a 1.5-h time lag was observed before ICER transcript levels increased, reaching maximal levels after 3.5 h. This rise in expression, correlating with the decrease in c-fos and junB levels, preceded apoptotic DNA fragmentation by 1.5 h. Transient expression of ICER promoter constructs demonstrated that cAMP responsiveness occurred through cAMP-autoregulatory response element (CARE)3/4, two of the four proposed response elements in the ICER promoter. In contrast to the cAMP-responsive cell line JEG-3, CARE1/2 was not functional for cAMP-activated transcription in WEHI7.2 cells. An observed differential binding pattern of WEHI and JEG nuclear extracts to these elements may account for the cell-specific differences in expression patterns. To determine the role of endogenous ICER in regulating gene expression, cells were treated with two sequential doses of forskolin after which ICER and c-fos mRNA levels were measured. The high levels of cAMP-induced ICER expression dramatically reduced a second induction of c-fos. These data suggest that ICER expression may function as an antioncogene to attenuate the expression of certain protooncogenes, thereby preventing transformation and oncogenesis due to continuous overexpression. Moreover, inhibition of growth-stimulatory genes may be required for the activation of the cell death machinery in specific cells.

TI  - Purification of the inlB gene product of Listeria monocytogenes and demonstration of its biological activity.  
AB  - Entry of Listeria monocytogenes into nonphagocytic cells requires the inlAB gene products. InlA and InlB are bacterial cell wall-associated polypeptides that can be released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. By applying more gentle extraction methods, we have purified InlB in its native form. Treatment of bacteria with various nondenaturating agents including mutanolysin, thiol reagents, sodium chloride, and detergents like Triton X-100 or 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate did not release substantial amounts of InlB from the bacterial cell wall. Instead, InlB was nearly quantitatively extracted in a solubilized form by treatment of bacteria with 1 M Tris-Cl or other protonated amines at pH 7.5. However, the reduced solubility of the extracted InlB in low-salt buffers hampered further biochemical purification. A panel of monoclonal antibodies against listerial Tris-Cl extracts containing InlB was therefore produced to generate reagents for use in affinity chromatography. One of the monoclonal antibodies enabled purification of the InlB protein to homogeneity with relatively high yields. When added externally, purified InlB associated with the surface of noninvasive bacteria such as Listeria innocua or an L. monocytogenes inlB2 mutant, where it promoted entry of these strains into Vero cells >300- and 17-fold, respectively. This effect was even more dramatic for HeLa cells, where the observed invasion was increased about 9,000- and 4,000-fold, respectively. The availability of purified native, invasion-competent InlB will allow analysis of the molecular basis of InlB-mediated entry into tissue culture cell lines in greater detail.

TI  - Circulating levels of allopregnanolone in humans: gender, age, and endocrine influences.  
AB  - Allopregnanolone is a neuroactive steroid involved in modulating behavioral functions, stress, and neuroendocrine axes in rats. Changes in plasma allopregnanolone levels throughout the menstrual cycle have been reported in healthy women, but there exists no information on the possible gender or age-related changes or on the source(s) of circulating allopregnanolone. The aim of the present study was to assess serum allopregnanolone concentrations according to gender, menstrual cycle, age, and menopause in normal men and women; serum progesterone (P) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels were evaluated in the same specimens. In addition, the possible source of circulating allopregnanolone in fertile women was investigated by using stimulatory and inhibitory endocrine tests acting on the ovary and/or adrenal cortex. The present study included 189 fertile women, 112 postmenopausal women, and 46 men. Serum steroid levels were determined after extraction, using specific RIAs. Allopregnanolone levels in fertile women in the follicular phase were similar to those in age-matched men; no significant difference was found between fertile women in the follicular phase and postmenopausal women. The highest levels were found in fertile women during the luteal phase (P < 0.01). An age-related decrease was observed in men (P < 0.01), but not in women. P and DHEA levels were significantly higher in women than in men and were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women (P < 0.01). Both P and DHEA showed an age-related decrease in men and women (P < 0.01). Serum allopregnanolone and P, but not DHEA, significantly increased in response to a GnRH test, whereas corticotropin-releasing factor and ACTH tests elicited a significant increase in allopregnanolone, P, and DHEA levels (P < 0.01). The suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis by dexamethasone markedly reduced both allopregnanolone and DHEA serum levels (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that although men show an age-related decrease, serum allopregnanolone levels in women do not change with age and correlate with P levels during the menstrual cycle and in response to endocrine tests. Ovary and adrenal cortex may be major sources of circulating allopregnanolone in fertile women.

TI  - Kinetic structure of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels suggests that the gating includes transitions through intermediate or secondary states. A mechanism for flickers.  
AB  - Mechanisms for the Ca2+-dependent gating of single large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels from cultured rat skeletal muscle were developed using two-dimensional analysis of single-channel currents recorded with the patch clamp technique. To extract and display the essential kinetic information, the kinetic structure, from the single channel currents, adjacent open and closed intervals were binned as pairs and plotted as two-dimensional dwell-time distributions, and the excesses and deficits of the interval pairs over that expected for independent pairing were plotted as dependency plots. The basic features of the kinetic structure were generally the same among single large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, but channel-specific differences were readily apparent, suggesting heterogeneities in the gating. Simple gating schemes drawn from the Monod- Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allosteric proteins could approximate the basic features of the Ca2+ dependence of the kinetic structure. However, consistent differences between the observed and predicted dependency plots suggested that additional brief lifetime closed states not included in MWC-type models were involved in the gating. Adding these additional brief closed states to the MWC-type models, either beyond the activation pathway (secondary closed states) or within the activation pathway (intermediate closed states), improved the description of the Ca2+ dependence of the kinetic structure. Secondary closed states are consistent with the closing of secondary gates or channel block. Intermediate closed states are consistent with mechanisms in which the channel activates by passing through a series of intermediate conformations between the more stable open and closed states. It is the added secondary or intermediate closed states that give rise to the majority of the brief closings (flickers) in the gating.

TI  - Application of solid-phase extraction in the method development for determination of SEPA, an acronym for soft enhancement of percutaneous absorption, in human, rat, and rabbit serum using GC-FID method.  
AB  - A new nonaqueous topical minoxidil formulation containing SEPA (2-n-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane) for enhancement of percutaneous absorption was under evaluation. SEPA does not have chromophore for either ultraviolet or fluorescence detection using liquid chromatography and has no functional groups for derivatization. Therefore, a direct gas-chromatographic method with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) was developed. Owing to the limited detection response of the FID detection, it needs a selective and concentrated extract for GC-FID analysis to improve the assay sensitivity to meet the requirement for pharmacokinetic evaluation after topical application. In addition, SEPA is a very volatile compound. Any extraction procedures involving evaporation will result in a poor recovery. The application of solid-phase extraction (SPE) makes it possible to achieve a selective and a 10-fold concentrated extract with an absolute extraction recovery of approximately 90%, which greatly improved the assay sensitivity. This method involved the extraction of SEPA and the internal standard (2-n-heptyl-1,3-dioxolane) from serum (0.1-1 ml) with 100 microliter of hexane-chloroform (1:1, v:v) using a 50 mg 1.0 ml-1 phenyl SPE column (Varian, Harbor City, CA, USA), followed by direct GC-FID analysis on a fused-silica column chemically bonded with cross-linked methyl silicone gum phase (Hewlett Packard Ultra-1, 12 m x 0.2 mm x 0.33 micron, Avondale, PA, USA). The assay demonstrated a lower limit of quantitation of 2.5 ng ml-1 and a linear range of 2.5 to 250 ng ml-1 with intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy of < or = 10%.

TI  - Expression of a gene for a porin-like protein of the OmpA family from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.  
AB  - An open reading frame in the genomic database of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was identified as having homology with an outer membrane protein. We found that the gene specified a protein belonging to the OmpA family, which includes some porins of gram-negative organisms. The gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into Escherichia coli. Overexpression of the gene was toxic to the host, but limited amounts could be purified from cells before growth ceased. A truncated gene devoid of the code for a presumed signal sequence was well expressed, but the protein had no pore-forming activity in the liposome swelling assay. However, the intact protein, OmpATb, behaved as a porin of low specific activity, with a pore diameter of 1.4 to 1.8 nm, and was also active in planar lipid bilayers, showing a single-channel conductance of 700 pS. The protein had a molecular mass of about 38 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised to the truncated protein recognized a protein of similar molecular mass in detergent extracts of broken M. tuberculosis cells. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed that the gene for OmpATb was expressed in M. tuberculosis cells growing in culture. Comparison of the purified protein with that in the detergent-extracted preparation using liposomes and planar lipid bilayers showed that the two materials had similar pore-forming properties. OmpATb is different from either of the mycobacterial porins described so far.

TI  - Evidence of two oxidative reaction steps initiating anaerobic degradation of resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) by the denitrifying bacterium Azoarcus anaerobius.  
AB  - The denitrifying bacterium Azoarcus anaerobius LuFRes1 grows anaerobically with resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) as the sole source of carbon and energy. The anaerobic degradation of this compound was investigated in cell extracts. Resorcinol reductase, the key enzyme for resorcinol catabolism in fermenting bacteria, was not present in this organism. Instead, resorcinol was hydroxylated to hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ; 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene) with nitrate or K3Fe(CN)6 as the electron acceptor. HHQ was further oxidized with nitrate to 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone as identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, UV/visible light spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy. Average specific activities were 60 mU mg of protein-1 for resorcinol hydroxylation and 150 mU mg of protein-1 for HHQ dehydrogenation. Both activities were found nearly exclusively in the membrane fraction and were only barely detectable in extracts of cells grown with benzoate, indicating that both reactions were specific for resorcinol degradation. These findings suggest a new strategy of anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds involving oxidative steps for destabilization of the aromatic ring, different from the reductive dearomatization mechanisms described so far.

TI  - Interrelationships between oxytocin and eicosanoids in human fetal membranes at term gestation: which role for leukotriene B4?  
AB  - The existence of a functional paracrine loop between oxytocin and prostaglandin F2-alpha in human placental cells has been demonstrated. The present study was undertaken to investigate further the possible interrelationships between oxytocin and eicosanoids in human intrauterine tissues at term gestation. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) on oxytocin (OT) production by explants of fetal membranes and amnion and the effect of oxytocin on the production of LTB4 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by both fetal membranes and amnion. In all cases studied (n = 25), short-term cultures of tissue explants (fetal membranes or amnion) have been carried out. The production of eicosanoids and oxytocin in culture medium was evaluated. Oxytocin measurement was carried out by radioimmunoassay following extraction of the substance with Sep Pak C18 cartridges, PGE2 and LTB4 were measured by radioimmunoassay directly in culture medium. Results show that LTB4 has no significant stimulatory effect on oxytocin production by fetal membranes or amnion tissue. On the other hand, oxytocin stimulates PGE2 release by both fetal membranes and isolated amnion, but has no effect on LTB4 production by these tissues. Taken together, these findings suggest the following conclusions: (1) a paracrine loop between LTB4 and oxytocin is lacking in fetal membranes and amnion at term pregnancy; (2) oxytocin exerts a stimulatory effect on PGE2 release by both fetal membranes and amnion; (3) the interrelationships between oxytocin and the different eicosanoids in the above tissues seem to be highly selective.

TI  - [Development of in situ TRAP assay detecting telomerase activity in cell]  
AB  - Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is detected in more than 85% of primary cancer tissues using a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Thus, telomerase is considered to be a novel marker for cancer. Telomerase activity is not detectable in somatic cells, except for hematopoietic cells and cryptic cells in the intestine and hair follicles, thus, detection of telomerase is important to delineate clinical implication of telomerase activity. We have developed semiquantitative fluorescence-based TRAP assay using fluorescence-end-labeling primers. Moreover, we also developed an in situ TRAP assay that detects telomerase activity at the cellular level. Using these TRAP assays, we are able to detect telomerase activity in various kinds of extracts or cytological specimens and therefore these applications may have additive information in the early detection of cancer and monitoring disease condition.

AB  - Circulating p53 antibodies (ELISA method), p53 genetic alterations (SSCP), and protein overexpression (immunohistochemistry) were studied in 41 patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas and 10 control patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA 19-9) were evaluated in parallel. Ten patients with p53 antibodies and p53 overexpression were selected.  Tumor DNA extracts from these 10 patients were analyzed by SSCP. Of all 41 patients, 10 (24%) showed significant levels of p53 antibodies, and p53 accumulation was detected in 20 (48%) patients. In six patients, p53 antibody concentrations decreased rapidly after surgery; in two patients, these levels returned to normal values. Of the 10 selected tumors, eight revealed TP53 gene mutations. Only two patients with high values of both CEA and CA 19-9 developed p53 antibodies. In conclusion, beside classical tumor markers, circulating p53 antibodies may be considered as additional markers for the management of patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas.

TI  - Suppressive effect of Ixodes ricinus salivary gland extract on mechanisms of natural immunity in vitro.  
AB  - Tick saliva has been shown to contain a variety of pharmacologically active molecules, including those with immunosuppressive activities. There is increasing evidence that the nonspecific suppression of host immunity by tick saliva is exploited by tick-borne pathogens, e.g. the saliva-activated transmission (SAT) of some tick-borne viruses. We have demonstrated the suppressive effect of the salivary gland extract (SGE) derived from partially fed (five days) Ixodes ricinus females on important mechanisms of innate immunity: natural killer (NK) cells, interferon and nitric oxide production. SGE reduced the interferon induction by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a culture of Balb/c mouse splenocytes by 94% and 62%, respectively. SGE suppressed the cytotoxicity of nonstimulated and in vivo poly I:C-stimulated mouse NK cells by up to 31% and 26%, respectively. The induction of NK activity in vitro by LPS but not by Concanavalin-A (Con-A) was also downregulated in the presence of SGE. The addition of SGE to cultures of mouse macrophages partially inhibited the production of nitric oxide, induced by LPS. These data suggest that the facilitating effect of SGE on the transmission of some tick-borne pathogens might be associated with the suppression of the host innate resistance mechanisms, represented by interferon, nitric oxide and NK cells.

The urine samples were subjected to solid extraction or TLC preparation, then R,S-MTPPA and R,S-MTPPA-TAU were separated on Chiralcel OD and Chiral AGP columns, respectively, with ultraviolet absorbance detection at 272 nm. The dose-response relationships for enantiomers of R,S-MTPPA and R,S-MTPPA-TAU were linear in the concentration ranges of 0.5-50 (r>0.9993) and 5-200 microg/ml (r>0.9982), respectively. Recoveries of all tested enantiomers from dog urine were roughly 90% within the above concentration ranges. Intra- and inter-day reproducibilities were sufficient for metabolic studies. These methods were applied to stereoselective determination of the enantiomers in dog urine after administration of either S- or R-MTPPA.

AB  - A sensitive method for the routine measurement of endogenous melatonin (MEL) in pineal, retina and plasma rat tissues has been developed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Quantification limit for MEL was 0.2 ng/mg protein in pineal, 15 pg/ml in plasma and 2.0 pg/mg protein in retina. To improve both MEL quantification and the reproducibility of the assay, an internal standard was used when an extraction in organic solvent was required, in contrast with other available chromatographic methods. MEL values and the circadian profile obtained in this study from both rat pineal and plasma agree with those reported previously. This method allows MEL detection in mammal retina, particularly in rat, where MEL levels are very low.

TI  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 cleavage and packaging proteins UL15 and UL28 are associated with B but not C capsids during packaging.  
AB  - At least seven viral genes encode proteins (UL6, UL15, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32, and UL33) that are required for DNA cleavage and packaging of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA. Sequence analysis reveals that UL15 shares homology with gp17, the large catalytic subunit of the bacteriophage T4 terminase. Thus, UL15 may play a direct role in the cleavage of viral DNA replication intermediates into monomers. In this study, we asked whether UL15 and other cleavage and packaging proteins could be detected in capsids isolated from infected cells. Consistent with previous studies showing that UL6 and UL25 are minor protein constituents of the capsids, we detected these proteins in both B and C capsids. In contrast, the previously identified full-length version (81 kDa) of UL15 was found predominantly in B capsids and in much smaller amounts in C capsids. In addition, the UL28 protein was found predominantly in B but not C capsids in a distribution similar to that of the 81-kDa version of UL15. These results suggest that UL28 and the 81-kDa form of UL15 are transiently associated with capsid intermediates during the packaging process. Surprisingly, however, a previously unidentified 87-kDa form of UL15 was found in the B and C capsids and in virions. Analysis of cells infected with mutants individually lacking UL6, UL15, UL25, UL28, or UL32 demonstrates that the lack of one cleavage and packaging protein does not affect the expression of the others. Furthermore, this analysis, together with guanidine HCl extraction analysis of purified capsids, indicates that UL6, UL25, and UL28 are able to associate with B capsids in the absence of other DNA cleavage and packaging proteins. On the other hand, the two UL15-related proteins (81 and 87 kDa) do not associate efficiently with B capsids in cells infected with UL6 and UL28 mutants. These results suggest that the ability of the UL15-related proteins to bind to B capsids may be mediated through interactions with UL6 and UL28.

TI  - Mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of exhaust particulate matter of biodiesel compared to fossil diesel fuel.  
AB  - The mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of diesel engine exhaust (DEE) from a modern passenger car using rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME, biodiesel) as fuel were directly compared to DEE of diesel fuel (DF) derived from petroleum. Combustion particulate matter was collected on glass fiber filters coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) from an exhaust dilution tunnel using three different engine test cycles on a chassis dynamometer. Filters were extracted with dichloromethane in a soxhlet apparatus for 12 h. The mutagenicity of the extracts was tested in the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome plate-incorporation assay using strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The toxicity to the established cell line L929 (mouse lung fibroblasts) was investigated in the neutral red assay. In the tester strains TA98 and TA100 a significant increase of mutations resulted for the particle extracts of both fuels, but for DF the revertants were significantly higher compared to RME. The highest levels of revertants were observed in tests including a cold start phase. This was probably due to incomplete combustion in the cold engine and a lower conversion rate of the cold catalytic converter. Testing with activated liver S9 fraction induced a slightly lower increase of revertants in most experiments. TA97a and TA102 showed no significant enhancement of spontaneous mutations. In the FTP-75 test cycle RME extracts showed slightly higher toxic effects to the L929 cells than DF, whereas in the other tests no significant differences were observable. These results indicate a higher mutagenic potency of DEE of DF compared to RME. This is probably due to the lower content of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) in RME exhaust, although the emitted masses of RME were higher in most test procedures applied in this study.

TI  - Epsin is an EH-domain-binding protein implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.  
AB  - During endocytosis, clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2, assisted by a variety of accessory factors, help to generate an invaginated bud at the cell membrane. One of these factors is Eps15, a clathrin-coat-associated protein that binds the alpha-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Here we investigate the function of Eps15 by characterizing an important binding partner for its region containing EH domains; this protein, epsin, is closely related to the Xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein MP90 and has a ubiquitous tissue distribution. It is concentrated together with Eps15 in presynaptic nerve terminals, which are sites specialized for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The central region of epsin binds AP-2 and its carboxy-terminal region binds Eps15. Epsin is associated with clathrin coats in situ, can be co-precipitated with AP-2 and Eps15 from brain extracts, but does not co-purify with clathrin coat components in a clathrin-coated vesicle fraction. When epsin function is disrupted, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked. We propose that epsin may participate, together with Eps15, in the molecular rearrangement of the clathrin coats that are required for coated-pit invagination and vesicle fission.

TI  - O.H.--a strong slow wave sleep inducing factor in tortoise (Emys orbicularis).  
AB  - The paper would be a contribution to the very complex and not yet clarified field of neurochemistry of slow wave sleep (SWS). The study was performed on 30 tortoises (Emys orbicularis): 20 "donors" and 10 "receivers". The animals were equipped with chronic cannula inserted in the third ventricular space and electrodes for electrographic recording (EEG, EOG, EMG and ECG). The controls consisted in administration into the third ventricle of receivers of 30 microliters of saline or concentrated cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) extracts from awake donors. The results were negative, i.e. the injected tortoises conserved their waking state indefinitely. The experiments were performed by introduction of 30 microliters of concentrated CSF extracts obtained from asleep donors into the third ventricular space of receivers. All the animals presented the behavioural and electrographic signs of the physiological SWS. The logical conclusion is that in the development of reptilian SWS, an endogenous SWS-inducing factor, which I called "O.H." (orbicularis hormone), was secreted by some hypnogenic structures and discharged in the CSF, with the consequences presented above.

TI  - Anaphylactic reaction to ingestion of Quercus ilex acorn nut.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction after eating acorn nuts, fruit of the holm oak (Quercus ilex), one of the most abundant trees in Spain. Several urticaria episodes upon ingestion of peanuts were also referred. OBJECTIVE: To assess the hypersensitivity reaction to acorn and to characterize the allergenic proteins involved. METHODS: Cutaneous tests were performed using the skin-prick technique, using a large variety of grass, tree and weed pollens as well as fresh nuts and nut extracts. Specific IgE determination was assessed by RAST. IgE binding bands were determined by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. RESULTS: Skin-prick tests were strongly positive with acorn and peanut. Olea europaea, Quercus alba, Quercus ilex and grass pollens also elicited a weal higher than negative control. Patient serum had measurable levels of IgE antibodies especially to acorn, peanut and grass pollens. Only one protein band, of 17.9 kDa molecular mass, showed IgE-binding properties in the acorn extract. The possible homology of this strong allergenic protein with the group 1 tree pollen allergens was evidenced by the partial inhibition of the western blot with Bet v 1. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of anaphylaxis to acorn ingestion as demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro results. A 17.9 kDa IgE-binding band, showing some homology to group 1 pollen tree allergens, was recognized by patient serum.

TI  - A comparative study of the tryptase release test and the cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST) in mite sensitive patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The stimulation of blood basophils to release mediators in vitro is widely used for diagnosis of allergic diseases. Tryptase release and sulphidopeptideleukotriene production are both triggered by cross-bridging of adjacent IgE molecules on the surface of IgE-bearing basophils. OBJECTIVE: We have compared the sensitivity of tryptase release test (TRT) and cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST) which, respectively, measure tryptase and sulphidopeptideleukotrienes that are produced upon cell stimulation by mite extracts. METHODS: Blood was taken from 247 patients with allergy to mites and 137 non-allergic control subjects. We measured tryptase release from basophils after allergen challenge in vitro by sandwich radioimmunoassay. The sulphidopeptideleukotrienes production was quantified by an ELISA test based on a monoclonal antibody which recognized leukotriene T4 (LTC4) and its metabolites LTD4 and LTE4. RESULTS: Our data show that both methods are equally effective to distinguish allergic patients from normal controls (P > 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between mite-specific serum IgE and CAST results (r = 0.69 for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; r = 0.73 for Dermatophagoides farinae). Correlations between IgE against mites and tryptase values appeared rather poor (r = 0.47 for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; 0.49 for Dermatophagoides farinae). Moreover, the data were used for the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and overall efficiency (Roc/Galen & Gambino analysis). The results were as follows: 71%, 87%, 64%, 76% (CAST results for Dermatophagoides farinae); 64%, 78%, 53%, 70% (TRT results for Dermatophagoides farinae). CONCLUSION: The partial discrepancies observed could be interpreted as a consequence of conditions that were technically not optimal. False-positive results may be due to the action of some non-specific cytotoxic agent, false-negative results may be due to hyporesponsive basophils or the low number of cells participating in the reaction and finally, in the case of TRT, to G4 monoclonal antibody to tryptase employed.

TI  - Interaction of murine macrophage-membrane proteins with components of the pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.  
AB  - The interaction of macrophage-membrane proteins and histoplasmin, a crude antigen of the pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, was studied using murine peritoneal macrophages. Membrane proteins were purified via membrane attachment to polycationic beads and solubilized in Tris-HCl/SDS/DTT/glycerol for protein extraction; afterwards they were adsorbed or not with H. capsulatum yeast or lectin binding-enriched by affinity chromatography. Membrane proteins and histoplasmin interactions were detected by ELISA and immunoblotting assays using anti-H. capsulatum human or mouse serum and biotinylated goat anti-human or anti-mouse IgG/streptavidin-peroxidase system to reveal the interaction. Results indicate that macrophage-membrane proteins and histoplasmin components interact in a dose-dependent reaction, and adsorption of macrophage-membrane proteins by yeast cells induces a critical decrease in the interaction. Macrophage-membrane glycoproteins with terminal D-galactosyl residues, purified by chromatography with Abrus precatorius lectin, bound to histoplasmin; and two bands of 68kD and 180kD of transferred membrane protein samples interacted with histoplasmin components, as revealed by immunoblot assays. Specificity for beta-galactoside residues on the macrophage-membrane was confirmed by galactose inhibition of the interaction between macrophage-membrane proteins and histoplasmin components, in competitive ELISA using sugars, as well as by enzymatic cleavage of the galactoside residues.

TI  - QIAamp spin columns as a method of DNA isolation for forensic casework.  
AB  - The Detroit Police Crime Lab has historically used Chelex as a method to isolate DNA for amplification and typing of bloodstains at the HLADQA1, PM and D1S80 loci. However, preliminary validation of several STR systems for casework has demonstrated that the Chelex procedure is not the best method of DNA isolation for STR amplifications for our purposes. Long term storage at -20 degrees C in the presence of unbuffered Chelex beads (approximately 1 year), combined with multiple freeze thaws, resulted in signal loss at a locus for many database samples. Therefore, we have employed the QIAamp spin column as an alternative method of DNA isolation for amplification and typing of STR loci currently being validated for use in the laboratory. Moreover, we determined that QIAamp isolated DNA is also suitable for HLADQA1, PM and D1S80 typing. A matrix study was performed to determine if the QIAamp DNA procedure would give better results on bloodstains deposited on "problem surfaces" such as leather, dirt and various dyed fabrics. Again, QIAamp isolated DNA was more readily typeable than Chelex isolated DNA. We successfully replaced the phenol/chloroform extraction steps utilized in our laboratory for differential extractions, a commonly used method for separating sperm and non-sperm fractions of sexual assault evidence, with the QIAamp spin columns. The QIAamp extracted DNA performed as well in all PCR amplification and typing procedures tested (PM, HLADQA1, D1S80, and STR (PowerPlex)) as the phenol/chloroform Centricon isolated or EtOH precipitated DNAs. Thus we concluded that QIAamp spin columns are a superior method for isolating DNA to be typed for a variety of loci.

TI  - Phosphoprotein analysis of sequential extracts of human dentin and the determination of the subsequent remineralization potential of these dentin matrices.  
AB  - Phosphoprotein appears to play an important role in the mineralization of dentin during tooth development and remineralization after demineralization by dental caries. To better understand this role, we describe the extraction and characterization of phosphoprotein from immature, human root apex dentin during and after EDTA demineralization. The extraction procedure included dissociation of the demineralized dentin matrix by guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn.HCl) followed by subsequent digestion with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and collagenase. Characterization of these extracts included 'Stains-All' staining of SDS polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and amino acid, protein and phosphorus analyses. The ability of these matrices to remineralize was determined by TEM and measuring calcium levels in the remineralized tissue by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The staining of SDS-PAGE gels and amino acid analysis showed that an intact phosphophoryn was extracted from the dentin of the immature apices during EDTA demineralization and that it had an apparent Mr approximately 140,000. In the subsequent extracts and digests, the phosphoprotein has a range of molecular weights, some of which may have been degraded products of the intact phosphoprotein. A greater quantity of phosphoprotein was found in the EDTA-demineralized dentin matrices than in dentin after Gdn.HCl, CNBr and collagenase digests. These EDTA-demineralized matrices also remineralized to a greater extent than those dissociated with Gdn.HCl. The differences in both the quantity and the quality, as defined by the amino acid residue profile, of the phosphoprotein in the sequential extracts of the root apex dentin may be important in affecting the ability of this tissue to remineralize.

TI  - Patch testing for Compositae allergy.  
AB  - The main allergenic constituents of Compositae plants are the sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). In recent years, a mixture of three SLs, each with a different sesquiterpene skeleton (alantolactone, dehydrocostuslactone or costunolide), has been routinely used to detect Compositae allergy. The purpose of our study was to establish the value of testing with a range of Compositae extracts. Ninety-seven consecutive patients with exposure pattern dermatitis or hand eczema and gardening as a hobby or occupation were patch tested to the European standard series including SL mix 0.1% pet., Compositae extracts and other relevant allergens. Twenty-six of the 97 patients tested showed allergic reactions to SL mix or Compositae extracts. Fifteen of these showed positive reactions to both the SL mix and Compositae extracts. Eleven patients showed a negative reaction to the SL mix but positive reaction to the Compositae extracts. Dandelion elicited a positive reaction in eight of the 11 SL mix-negative patients and three patients reacted to feverfew. The SL mix failed to detect 38% of our Compositae-sensitive patients. Dandelion extract alone detected 73% of SL-negative patients. Additional testing with feverfew extract would have detected 91% of the SL mix-negative individuals. Our study highlights the importance of testing the response of SL-negative patients to additional Compositae extracts when there is a clinical suspicion of Compositae allergy.

TI  - Liquid-liquid extraction procedure for trace determination of cyclophosphamide in human urine by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.  
AB  - A sensitive, specific and accurate high performance liquid chromatography/ionspray-tandem mass spectrometry procedure (HPLC/MS/MS) has been developed to quantify cyclophosphamide in human urine from hospital personnel involved in drug preparation and administration of antineoplastic alkylating agents. This methodology, which includes liquid-liquid extraction with ethylacetate, requires no derivatization procedures, preventing cyclophosphamide (CP) from possible thermal and chemical decomposition reactions. We detected the excretion of this unmetabolized alkylating drug in 50% of all the study participants. The amount of CP ranged from 0.1 ng microL-1 to 1.9 ng microL-1 urine. This methodology was validated by the use of ifosfamide as internal standard. The assay was linear over the range 0 to 3.2 ng microL-1 urine, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.2 microL-1. The limit of detection was assessed at 0.05 ng microL-1 urine. This method is characterized by a coefficient of variation < 10%. Standard calibration curves, obtained on three different days, had correlation coefficients always greater than 0.998. The intra and interday precision were within 11%, and accuracy was in the range 99-103%. The mean extracted recovery assessed at three different concentrations (0.5, 0.8, 3.2 ng microL-1) was always more than 85%. The extraction efficiency of cyclophosphamide from urine samples was also studied at six different pH values (pH 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10).  The maximum extraction efficiency was obtained when the pH of urine solutions was adjusted to 7.0

TI  - Validation of deconvolutional analysis for the measurement of hepatic function in dogs with toxic-induced liver disease.  
AB  - The extraction of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-mebrofenin (Choletec) by the liver can be used to evaluate the severity of hepatocellular disease. The hepatic parenchymal cells extract mebrofenin from the blood by the same active transport mechanism as bilirubin. The ability of the liver to extract 99mTc-mebrofenin is a measure of hepatic parenchymal cell function. In this study, we induced hepatocellular disease by administration of a hepatotoxic drug and compared a direct method of determining the hepatic extraction of 99mTc-mebrofenin to hepatic extraction fraction derived from deconvolutional analysis. We also compared both methods of calculating the hepatic extraction of 99mTc-mebrofenin to liver histopathology. Hepatic extraction fraction derived from deconvolutional analysis correlated very well to the direct measurement technique (R=0.922, p < 0.001). Both methods of determining hepatic extraction correlated well to quantitative histopathology, having the same correlation coefficient and p values. (R=-0.833, p=0.003). As the hepatic extraction 99mTc-mebrofenin decreased, the severity of the histopathologic lesions of the liver increased in a linear fashion. There was a significant correlation of the hepatic excretion T1/2 to quantitative histopathology (R=0.949, p < 0.001). The hepatic excretion T1/2 increased as the severity of the histopathologic lesions of the liver increased. Hepatic extraction (HEF) and excretion of 99mTc-mebrofenin are good predictors of the severity of hepatocellular damage in toxic induced liver disease. This study helps validate the premise that HEF derived from deconvolutional analysis is a good predictor of the actual first pass hepatic extraction of 99mTc-mebrofenin.

TI  - Suppressive effects of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f., a traditional Chinese medicine, on collagen arthritis in mice.  
AB  - The effect of chloroform extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (TWH extract), a traditional immunosuppressive Chinese herb, on type II collagen (C II)-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice was studied. In the first set of experiments, we examined the effect of TWH extract on cellular immune responses to C II. As compared with mice treated with saline, TWH extract administered orally at doses of more than 400 microg kg(-1) once a day for 14 days inhibited the ability of inguinal lymph node cells to produce T cell cytokines interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma when the cells were obtained from mice 21 days after immunization and cultured in vitro with C II. Treatment with TWH extract also inhibited production of macrophage cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to in vitro stimulation of lymph node cells with C II. In the second part of the experiment, we evaluated the influence of TWH extract on the incidence and development of arthritis in murine CIA. Mice were immunized twice at a 3-week interval with bovine C II, with TWH extract being given orally once a day for 14 days with four different regimens. A 14-day course of TWH extract treatment at a daily dose of 400 microg kg(-1), which began on the day of the first C II immunization, suppressed the development of arthritis, as well as antibody production and delayed-type hypersensitivity to C II. Treatment with TWH extract, which started on the same day as the booster immunization, also resulted in inhibition of development of arthritis and of immune responses to C II. On the other hand, therapeutic administration with TWH extract did not affect the clinical course of the disease and the immune response to C II.

TI  - Visualization and quantification of birch-pollen allergens directly on air-sampling filters.  
AB  - A new technique is presented to detect and quantify birch (Betula pendula)-pollen allergens directly on air-sampling filters. It is based on the use of specific antibodies, enzymatic reactions, and measurement by chemiluminescence or densitometry. The major pollen antigens are the most important birch allergens. The antibodies used recognize birch-pollen antigens which thus correspond to allergens. Calibration was done with a standardized extract of birch pollen for skin prick testing. The correlation coefficient for the logarithms of luminescence and the amount of birch-pollen allergen applied on filters was > 0.98 in the range 0.04-200 SQ units. A similar correlation was found for the logarithms of the integrated densitometry values and the amount of birch-pollen allergen applied on filters. The number of major pollen-antigen particles or grains on filters could be estimated by counting the major stained spots produced by precipitated enzymatic products. The correlation coefficient was 0.90 for the logarithms of the number of counted major antigen spots and the calculated antigen amount obtained by luminometric measurements. Our results demonstrate that birch-pollen allergens can be determined directly on air-sampling, Teflon-based filters by luminometry, optical density, or particle counting.

TI  - Quercetin inhibits hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and DNA damage in HepG2 cells.  
AB  - We have investigated the effect of the plant-derived flavonoid quercetin in relation to potential oxidant and antioxidant activity on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity and DNA integrity in HepG2 cells. Gel mobility shift assays using a gamma-32P-labelled NF-kappaB oligonucleotide probe showed that treatment of HepG2 cells with quercetin (up to 10 microM, sub-cytotoxic) did not elevate NF-kappaB binding activity of nuclear extract protein but did inhibit binding activity of an extract from cells treated with the oxidant H2O2. A similar inhibition by quercetin of H2O2-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation was demonstrated using a cat reporter gene assay. Considering oxidative DNA damage, using single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay we have demonstrated that quercetin (10 microM and below) did not induce DNA strand breaks. However, a marked and statistically significant (P < 0.01 at 10 microM) inhibition of strand breakage produced by H2O2 was detected. The specific formation of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in calf thymus DNA exposed to either gamma-irradiation or the Fenton reaction system was also inhibited (P < 0.01 at 10 microM) by quercetin in a dose-dependent manner. This was not accompanied by formation of 8-oxodG by quercetin itself. The inhibition of 8-oxodG formation by gamma-irradiation was more potent (IC50 = 0.05 microM) than that by the Fenton reaction (IC50 = 0.5 microM), implying that the mechanism of protection may be different between the two systems. The inhibition of both NF-kappaB binding activity and oxidative DNA damage suggests that its antioxidant potential outweighs its oxidative potential in a cellular environment, which may contribute to anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Effects of the Turkish subspecies of Viscum album on macrophage-derived cytokines.  
AB  - Viscum album L. herbs are used for the treatment of various diseases. Apart from their immunostimulatory, antitumor, and hypotension inducing activities, anti-inflammatory effects has also been recorded in the literature. Since the immunostimulatory activity of mistletoe is mainly attributed to a stimulation of the mononuclear phagocytic system and to an induction of inflammation by macrophage-derived cytokines, utilization based on anti-inflammatory activity seems in contrast with its use as immunostimulant. The inhibitory effects of 80% ethanol extracts and subfractions obtained by petroleum ether, diethylether, ethylacetate and n-butanol from three Turkish subspecies of V. album L. (ssp. album, ssp. abietis, ssp. austriacum) against interleukins (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were studied. Ethanolic (80%) extracts of all three subspecies exhibited almost no significant inhibitory activity on the proinflammatory cytokines, at least in the concentrations applied in this study. In contrast, they induce a concentration dependent stimulation of these cytokines. On the other hand, moderate to weak, dose dependent inhibitory effects were observed on fractionation, which may be attributed to the existence of less polar components with anti-inflammatory activity. Based on our results, it was concluded that the utilization of ethanol extracts for anti-inflammatory purposes would not be beneficial probably due to the partial extraction of the low-molecular-weight polypeptides, i.e. viscotoxins, which induce an inflammatory response. Moreover, for anti-inflammatory effects, extracts of Viscum album ssp. austriacum may be preferred, since higher inhibitory ratios were obtained against inflammatory cytokines than with the other two subspecies.

TI  - Oral anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic activities of a hydroalcoholic extract and partitioned fractions of Turnera ulmifolia (Turneraceae).  
AB  - Anti-inflammatory studies were conducted on rats or mice using a crude hydroalcoholic extract of the aerial parts of Turnera ulmifolia and it's partitioned fractions, i.e. the aqueous, ethyl acetate and ethanolic fractions. The hydroalcoholic extract and it's fractions (aqueous and ethanolic) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema. However, only the ethanolic fraction was used in the other experiments due to it's yield. The extract also inhibited the cotton pellet granuloma and the increase of vascular permeability induced by histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, but not that produced by bradykinin. The extract or the fraction did not present analgesic activity in the writhing test using acetic acid and did not reduce croton oil-induced ear edema in mice. When the ethanolic fraction and LPS were administered i.p. to Balb/C mice 72 h before blood or peritoneal fluid collection, no changes were observed in the white or total blood cell counts in the peripheral blood. On the other hand, changes were observed in both total and differential cell counts in the peritoneal exudate since all doses of the fraction reduced the number of total leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes) obtained from the peritoneal exudate. In contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the administration of the hydroalcoholic extract or the ethanolic fraction alone did not potentiate gastric mucosal lesions induced by aspirin. The extract and the fraction inhibited the appearance of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin, ethanol and pylorus ligature, but not those induced by stress. As also observed with carbenoxolone, the ethanolic fraction increased the wall mucus in hypothermical-restraint stress-induced gastric lesions. The anti-ulcerogenic effect of the extract and of the ethanolic fraction may be related to an increase of mucosal defensive factors, such as prostaglandin and mucus. The anti-inflammatory actions of the extract and the fraction may be due to an inhibitory effect on histamine and cyclooxygenase II, but not on cyclooxygenase I, because the extract and it's fraction present both anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic effects. The major substances present in the ethanolic fraction are flavonoids which will be isolated and identified.

TI  - Antigenic relationships among pathogenic Beauveria bassiana with Engyodontium album (= B. alba) and non-pathogenic species of the genus Beauveria.

Aqueous-merthiolated extracts derived from 10-day-old Sabouraud's dextrose agar slant cultures (25 degrees C) were concentrated (25X), and reacted against rabbit anti-B. bassiana serum in the presence of partially purified homologous antigen (20X) prepared from 5-week-old shaken cultures (30 degrees C), using a microimmunodiffusion procedure. Beauveria bassiana reference antigen and antiserum reacted to produce four bands of identity. With the exception of E. album, which was negative, extracts of the isolates of B. brogniartii, B. densa, B. stephanoderis, B. velata, B. vermiconia and the unknown Beauveria species all produced 2-4 lines of identity against the homologous anti-B. bassiana serum. These results suggested that all the species of the genus Beauveria tested were antigenically related to B. bassiana. Engyodontium album demonstrated antigenic distinctness, however, from B. bassiana and thus supported the validity of this taxon.

TI  - Neurokinin A is the predominant tachykinin in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in normal and asthmatic subjects.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sensory neuropeptides are present in human airways and may contribute to diseases such as asthma. This study quantified and characterised substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in asthmatic and normal subjects. METHODS: Using specific radioimmunoassay (RIA), SP, NKA and CGRP were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from asthmatic subjects (n = 5), normal subjects (n = 5), atopic non-asthmatic subjects (n = 6), and asthmatic subjects four hours after allergen challenge (n = 12). Peptide immunoreactivity was characterised using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and RIA. RESULTS: No SP or CGRP immunoreactivity was detected in any of the fractions from samples after extraction, HPLC, and RIA. Non-specific binding resulted in spurious SP immunoreactivity being detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid when no extraction process was employed. NKA was detected in significant amounts in asthmatic (median 550, range 425-625 pg/ml) and normal subjects (median 725, range 350-1425 pg/ml). The level of NKA was significantly higher in the asthmatic subjects after allergen challenge (median 750, range 350-1250 pg/ml) than in unchallenged asthmatic subjects (median 600, range 425-600 pg/ml, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Extraction and characterisation of peptides from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid must be performed to ensure that the measured immunoreactivity represents target peptide. NKA is present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in high concentrations and is the predominant tachykinin. The concentrations of NKA are similar in normal subjects and subjects with mild asthma.
