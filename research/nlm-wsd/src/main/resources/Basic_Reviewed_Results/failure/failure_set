TI  - The influence of breast feeding on the occurrence of dysentery, persistent diarrhoea and malnutrition among Nigerian children with diarrhoea.  
AB  - A case-control study of children attending a diarrhoea treatment unit (DTU) in Calabar, Nigeria was undertaken to evaluate the association between failure to breastfeed on one hand, and dysentery, persistent diarrhoea and malnutrition on the other. The prevalence of dysentery, persistent diarrhoea and underweight were 6.3%, 1.2% and 36.4% respectively among a total of 1133 children with diarrhoea. The proportion of the children with persistent diarrhoea or underweight was significantly lower among currently breastfeeding children than the age-matched, non-breastfeeding counterparts (p < 0.05). Dysentery was also less frequent among breastfeeding children (5.8%) than the non-breastfeeding ones (7.4%), but this did not reach statistical significance. The findings lend support to the enormous benefit of breastfeeding as a child survival strategy. Global efforts geared towards the support of breastfeeding should be intensified especially the less developed countries where diarrhoea-related morbidity and mortality constitute a major public health problem.

TI  - Increased MRP expression is associated with resistance to radiation, anthracyclines and etoposide in cells treated with fractionated gamma-radiation.  
AB  - The failure of chemotherapy is often associated with the failure of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer. To investigate this relationship, the CCRF-CEM (CEM) human T-cell leukaemia cell line was treated with fractionated gamma-radiation totalling 75 Gy (10 cycles of 1.5 Gy daily for 5 days). This produced the CEMRR subline which was 1.5-fold resistant to radiation compared with the parental CEM cells. The CEMRR subline was also resistant to daunorbicin, idarubicin and etoposide but not to paclitaxel, cis-platinum or chlorambucil. Treatment with 50 microM buthionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, reversed the daunorubicin resistance in the CEMRR subline. Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) mRNA was 6-fold higher in the CEMRR subline than in the CEM cells, and there was no detectable expression of P-glycoprotein in either the CEM cells or the CEMRR subline. Treatment of the CEM cells with 2 Gy of gamma-radiation caused an increase in MRP-mRNA within 4 hr which, by 24 hr, was greater than 5-fold that of the untreated CEM cells. No change in MRP mRNA was observed in the CEMRR subline with similar treatment. We conclude that MRP is involved in the immediate response to radiation and it may account for the drug resistance that often develops following radiation treatment.

TI  - Treatment outcome after tangential radiation therapy without axillary dissection in patients with early-stage breast cancer and clinically negative axillary nodes.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the risk of nodal failure in patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes treated with two-field tangential breast irradiation alone, without axillary lymph node dissection or use of a third nodal field. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1988 and 1993, 986 evaluable women with clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Of these, 92 patients with clinically negative nodes received tangential breast irradiation (median dose, 45 Gy) followed by a boost, without axillary dissection. The median age was 69 years (range, 49-87). Eighty-three percent had T1 tumors. Fifty-three patients received tamoxifen, 1 received chemotherapy, and 2 patients received both. Median follow-up time for the 79 survivors was 50 months (range, 15-96). Three patients (3%) have been lost to follow-up after 20-32 months. RESULTS: No isolated regional nodal failures were identified. Two patients developed recurrence in the breast only (one of whom had a single positive axillary node found pathologically after mastectomy). One patient developed simultaneous local and distant failures, and six patients developed distant failures only. One patient developed a contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ, and two patients developed other cancers. CONCLUSION: Among a group of 92 patients with early-stage breast cancer (typically T1 and also typically elderly) treated with tangential breast irradiation alone without axillary dissection, with or without systemic therapy, there were no isolated axillary or supraclavicular regional failures. These results suggest that it is feasible to treat selected clinically node-negative patients with tangential fields alone. Prospective studies of this approach are warranted.

TI  - Role of the isoforms of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein in the initiation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene transcription at birth.  
AB  - The gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a target of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) and -beta (C/EBPbeta), begins to be expressed in the liver at birth. Mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CEBPalpha (C/EBPalpha-/- mice) die shortly after birth of hypoglycemia, with no detectable hepatic PEPCK mRNA and negligible hepatic glycogen stores. Half of the mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CEBPbeta (C/EBPbeta-/- mice) have normal glucose homeostasis (phenotype A), and the other half die at birth of hypoglycemia due to a failure to express the gene for PEPCK and to mobilize hepatic glycogen (phenotype B). Insulin deficiency induces C/EBPalpha and PEPCK gene transcription in the livers of 19-day fetal rats, whereas dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) increases the expression of the gene for C/EBPbeta and causes a transient burst of PEPCK mRNA. Bt2cAMP induces PEPCK mRNA in the livers of fetal C/EBPalpha-/- mice, but at only 20% of the level of control animals; however, there is no induction of PEPCK mRNA if the cyclic nucleotide is injected into C/EBPalpha-/- mice immediately after delivery. The expression of the gene for C/EBPbeta is markedly induced in the livers of C/EBPalpha-/- mice within 2 h after the administration of Bt2cAMP. C/EBPbeta-/- mice injected at 20 days of fetal life with Bt2cAMP have a normal pattern of induction of hepatic PEPCK mRNA. In C/EBPbeta-/- mice with phenotype B, the administration of Bt2cAMP immediately after delivery induces PEPCK mRNA, causes the mobilization of hepatic glycogen, and maintains normal glucose homeostasis for up to 4 h (duration of the experiment). We conclude that C/EBPalpha is required for the cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression in the liver and that C/EBPbeta can compensate for the loss of C/EBPalpha if its concentration is induced to appropriate levels.

TI  - Properties of tissue from around cemented joint implants with erosive and/or linear osteolysis.  
AB  - Levels of bone remodeling agents were measured in conditioned media from cultures of periprosthetic pseudosynovial membranes and related to the radiographic features of the failed joint implants. Radiographs of both cemented hip (n = 28) and cemented knee (n = 11) implants were examined and the pattern of radiolucency was classified as erosive linear, or mixed. Similar levels of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta-1, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were found in pseudosynovial membrane conditioned media from all 3 groups of hips and the knee group (all linear). Significant correlations were evident only between PGE2 and TNF-alpha levels in the linear hip group and PGE2 and IL-1 beta levels in the knee group. A close correlation was found between IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in both linear and erosive hips. It is suggested that coregulation of these bone remodeling agents differs with the radiographic appearance of the failed joint implants. As all the implants were cemented and the results contrast with those of others obtained with pseudosynovial membrane conditioned media from cementless implants, it is considered that cement critically influences the process of implant failure.

AB  - A polyacid-modified composite resin (compomer) restorative material was evaluated in primary molars in a multicenter study. One hundred and fifty-nine class-II restorations were placed by 6 dentists in 79 children. The restorations were evaluated during a 2-year period, using slightly modified USPHS criteria. After 1 year 151 restorations were evaluated and, after 2 years, 104. The cumulative failure rate after 1 year was 8% and after 2 years, 22%. The main reasons for failure were loss of retention (12%) and secondary caries (5%). The compomer material showed a high failure rate, comparable to that of other adhesive restorative materials currently used in primary molars. A large operator variation in failure rate indicates the technique sensitivity of the material.

TI  - Diencephalic syndrome: clinical features and imaging findings.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To emphasize the importance of imaging in children with diencephalic syndrome due to hypothalamic/chiasmatic astrocytomas. METHODS: Findings in nine patients (mean age, 26 months) with diencephalic syndrome and hypothalamic/chiasmatic astrocytomas were analyzed retrospectively, including reviewing clinical records, imaging examinations, and follow-up studies. RESULTS: Symptoms and signs included failure to thrive (n = 9), nystagmus (n = 3), visual field defects (n = 1), optic pallor (n = 1), emesis (n = 2), and headache (n = 1). All patients had hypothalamic/chiasmatic masses. Five patients underwent biopsy, and, in all cases, specimens showed low-grade astrocytoma. Imaging studies were available in eight patients. All tumors were large (median maximum diameter, 3.5 cm), involved the chiasm and hypothalamus, and showed homogeneous enhancement. Three patients had hydrocephalus and two had metastases. At follow-up, five patients had recurrent disease and two had died. CONCLUSION: Diencephalic syndrome is a rare cause of failure to thrive in childhood, and diagnosis of a hypothalamic/ chiasmatic astrocytoma might therefore be delayed. The astrocytomas associated with this syndrome are larger, occur at a younger age, and are often more aggressive than other astrocytomas arising in this region.

TI  - Pharmaceutical container/closure integrity. II: The relationship between microbial ingress and helium leak rates in rubber-stoppered glass vials.  
AB  - Helium leak rate measurements were quantitatively correlated to the probability of microbial ingress for rubber-stoppered glass vials subjected to immersion challenge. Standard 10-mL tubing glass vials were modified by inserting micropipettes of various sizes (0.1 to 10 microns nominal diameter) into a side wall hole and securing them with epoxy. Butyl rubber closures and aluminum crimps were used to seal the vials. The test units were sealed in a helium-filled glove bag, then the absolute helium leak rates were determined. The test units were disassembled, filled with media, resealed, and autoclaved. The test units were thermally treated to eliminate airlocks within the micropipette lumen and establish a liquid path between microbial challenge media and the test units' contents. Microbial challenge was performed by immersing the test units in a 35 degrees C bath containing magnesium ion and 8 to 10 logs of viable P. diminuta and E. coli for 24 hours. The test units were then incubated at 35 degrees C for an additional 13 days. Microbial ingress was detected by turbidity and plating on blood agar. The elimination of airlocks was confirmed by the presence of magnesium ions in the vial contents by atomic absorption spectrometry. A total of 288 vials were subjected to microbial challenge testing. Those test units whose contents failed to show detectable magnesium ions were eliminated from further analysis. At large leak rates, the probability of microbial ingress approached 100% and at very low leak rates microbial ingress rates were 0%. A dramatic increase in microbial failure occurred in the leak rate region 10(-4.5) to 10(-3) std cc/sec, which roughly corresponded to leak diameters ranging from 0.4 to 2 microns. Below a leak rate of 10(-4.5) std cc/sec the microbial failure rate was < 10%. The critical leak rate in our studies, i.e. the value below which microbial ingress cannot occur because the leak is too small, was observed to be between 10(-5) and 10(-5.8) std cc/sec, which corresponds to an approximate leak diameter of 0.2-0.3 micron.

TI  - Communicating foodborne disease risk.  
AB  - The food industry, like many others, has a risk communication problem. That problem is manifested in the public's desire to know the truth about outbreaks of foodborne diseases; ongoing concern about the safety of foods, additives, and food-processing procedures; and continued apathy regarding aspects of routine food hygiene. If these concerns are addressed in a coherent and trustworthy way, the public will have better and cheaper food. However, sloppy risk communication can itself cause public health damage. Because citizens are ill-equipped to discriminate among information sources, the food industry as a whole bears responsibility for the successes and failures of its individual members.

TI  - Mechanisms of growth failure in non-growth-hormone deficient children of short stature.  
AB  - So far, the clinical evaluation of short children has focused on the measurement of immunoreactive growth hormone (GH) in the blood to determine if the growth retardation is due to GH deficiency. However, GH-dependent short stature may be caused by defects in either the secretion of bioactive GH or by the inability to respond to GH. Both GH secretion and GH responsiveness should, therefore, be evaluated when investigating the cause of short stature. Recent advances in molecular biology have generated new ways of studying different molecules involved in growth regulation, and new genetic defects have been identified in short children.

TI  - Oxygen and placental villous development: origins of fetal hypoxia.  
AB  - The increasing practice of preterm delivery in the fetal interest for conditions such as pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has provided an opportunity to study placental structure in pregnancies with prenatal evidence of fetal compromise. These data suggest that the origin of fetal hypoxia in IUGR with absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical arteries is due to a failure of oxygen transport from intervillous space to umbilical vein.  Failure of the fetoplacental circulation to extract oxygen from the intervillous space under such circumstances means intervillous PO2 is closer to maternal arterial values than under physiological conditions. Correspondingly the placental villi are chronically exposed to a higher oxygen tension than under normal circumstances--the term 'hyperoxia', relative to normal intraplacental oxygenation, is proposed to describe this situation. Both the trophoblast and villous core react to increased oxygen despite fetal hypoxia. These results challenge the generally accepted concept of 'placental hypoxia' in all circumstances where fetal hypoxia might arise. Therefore three categories are proposed for the origins of fetal hypoxia: (1) preplacental hypoxia; (2) uteroplacental hypoxia; and (3) postplacental hypoxia. Examples for these three disease states are listed in this review and the structural reaction patterns of placental villi to these differences in oxygenation are discussed.

TI  - Legal issues of computer imaging in plastic surgery: a primer.  
AB  - Although plastic surgeons are increasingly incorporating computer imaging techniques into their practices, many fear the possibility of legally binding themselves to achieve surgical results identical to those reflected in computer images. Computer imaging allows surgeons to manipulate digital photographs of patients to project possible surgical outcomes. Some of the many benefits imaging techniques pose include improving doctor-patient communication, facilitating the education and training of residents, and reducing administrative and storage costs. Despite the many advantages computer imaging systems offer, however, surgeons understandably worry that imaging systems expose them to immense legal liability. The possible exploitation of computer imaging by novice surgeons as a marketing tool, coupled with the lack of consensus regarding the treatment of computer images, adds to the concern of surgeons. A careful analysis of the law, however, reveals that surgeons who use computer imaging carefully and conservatively, and adopt a few simple precautions, substantially reduce their vulnerability to legal claims. In particular, surgeons face possible claims of implied contract, failure to instruct, and malpractice from their use or failure to use computer imaging. Nevertheless, legal and practical obstacles frustrate each of those causes of actions. Moreover, surgeons who incorporate a few simple safeguards into their practice may further reduce their legal susceptibility.

TI  - Melatonin attenuates photic disruption of circadian rhythms in Siberian hamsters.  
AB  - Body temperature (Tb) was recorded via a biotelemetry system from 28 adult male Siberian hamsters maintained in a light-dark (LD) cycle of 16 h light/day for several months. After Tb was recorded for 3 wk, the LD cycle was phase delayed by extending the light phase by 5 h for 1 day; animals remained on a 16:8 LD cycle for the remainder of the experiment. Hamsters were injected daily with melatonin or vehicle solution for several weeks, beginning either 2 mo after (experiment 1) or on the day of (experiment 2) the phase shift; injections occurred within 30 min of dark onset. In experiment 1, 75% of animals free ran with circadian periods >24 h, beginning on the day of the phase shift, and never reentrained to the LD cycle; no hamsters unambiguously entrained to daily injections. In contrast, 78% of animals in experiment 2 entrained to melatonin injections, and 71% of those animals subsequently reentrained to the photocycle when the injection regimen ended. No vehicle-treated animals entrained to the injection schedule. Melatonin had no effect on daily mean Tb and Tb rhythm amplitude in either experiment; however, melatonin doubled the duration of a hyperthermic response that occurred after each injection. Thus melatonin can prevent loss of entrainment induced by a phase shift of the LD cycle but cannot restore entrainment to free-running animals.  Failure to reentrain in the presence of two appropriately coordinated entraining agents also suggests that a phase shift of the photocycle can diminish the sensitivity of the circadian system to both photic and nonphotic input.

TI  - Electrophysiological analyses of threshold conditions and rate-dependent failure of excitation in single myocytes from rabbit ventricle.  
AB  - The changes in transmembrane ionic currents that underlie normal excitability and rate-dependent failure were studied in single cells from rabbit ventricle by using whole cell voltage clamp methods. When trains of brief (1 to 2 ms) stimuli are applied at strengths very close to the threshold for excitation, a number of different patterns of action potential entrainment and failure are observed. In an individual cell, a characteristic pattern of entrainment or failure can be maintained for a relatively long time, allowing both a detailed description and a quantitative investigation of the ionic basis for this phenomenon. Three hypotheses for rate-dependent failure of excitation in rabbit ventricle were examined. The first is that following relatively high rates of stimulation, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases and, secondarily, a background inwardly rectifying potassium ion current (IK1) decreases, thereby lowering the excitation threshold. The second hypothesis is that residual activation of the delayed rectifier potassium ion current (IK) causes the stimulus to become subthreshold as the rate of stimulation increases. The third hypothesis is that small changes in the time and voltage dependence of the inactivation and reactivation of the sodium ion current (INa) result in less net inward ion current for a given waveform of depolarization, and the cell therefore becomes inexcitable (eg, to every second stimulus). The calcium ion hypothesis was tested by buffering changes in intracellular calcium ion concentrations with BAPTA. The results strongly suggest that changes in intracellular calcium ion concentrations do not contribute significantly to the observed patterns of failure of excitation. The delayed rectifier hypothesis was evaluated using the class III antiarrhythmic drug dofetilide, which selectively blocks a large fraction of the IK current in rabbit ventricle. Dofetilide slightly decreased the stimulus threshold, suggesting that residual activation of the rapidly activated outward conductance of potassium ions is an important variable under some conditions. The INa hypothesis was tested by altering the size of INa with tetrodotoxin (TTX). After TTX application, the threshold for excitation increased significantly, and rate-dependent failure and entrainment were no longer observed until the stimulus strength was increased. These results show that INa is an essential variable underlying normal excitation and entrainment in rabbit ventricle. This is plausible because INa is 20 to 50 times larger than either the maximum outward current due to IK1 or the fully activated IK in this tissue.

TI  - The membrane-bound form of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor promotes survival of cultured renal epithelial cells.  
AB  - To understand whether expression of membrane-anchored heparin binding epidermal growth factor (proHB-EGF) is involved in renal epithelial cell survival, rat membrane-bound HB-EGF precursor was stably transfected into a renal epithelial cell line, NRK 52E cells (NRKproHB-EGF). When exposed to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), there were no differences in growth rates among wild-type (WT), vector-transfected (NRKvector), and NRKproHB-EGF. However, when cells were grown in the presence of 1% FCS, the growth rate of NRKproHB-EGF was 65% faster. When confluent cell monolayers were exposed to H2O2 or etoposide, WT or NRKvector exhibited significant apoptotic bodies and DNA laddering; in contrast, NRKproHB-EGF were resistant to both stimuli, as indicated by increased cell viability and marked decrease of apoptotic bodies and DNA laddering. When plated at high density onto plastic dishes without FCS, WT and NRKvector formed few attachments, did not proliferate, and underwent apoptosis. By day 3, no cells survived. Addition of exogenous recombinant HB-EGF (10(-8) M) to WT or NRKvector increased cell survival by <10% and incubation with conditioned media of NRKproHB-EGF had no effect. In contrast, NRKproHB-EGF attached and formed epithelial colonies, although they did not proliferate. After 3 days, cell viability was 84% of the initial cell number plated, and no evidence of apoptosis was present. When plated in 10% FCS, NRKproHB-EGF attachment to plastic substratum at 1, 2, and 3 h was 250% greater than that of WT or NRKvector. Addition of exogenous recombinant human HB-EGF to WT or NRKvector increased attachment by <50%. When grown on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or in the presence of the integrin receptor-blocking peptide GRGDTP, neither WT nor NRKvector attached to the substratum or formed cell-cell attachments. Compared with WT or NRKvector, NRKproHB-EGF exhibited 300% greater cell viability on either poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated dishes or in the presence of GRGDTP and formed cell clusters. When plated at low density (1 x 10(3) cells/1.5-cm dish) or at high density in the presence of an anti-HB-EGF blocking antibody, NRKproHB-EGF failed to form epithelial colonies. Addition of formalin fixed NRKproHB-EGF promoted EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in quiescent A431 cells and stimulated DNA synthesis and prevented H2O2-induced apoptosis in renal epithelial cells. These results indicate that membrane-bound HB-EGF promotes renal epithelial cell survival, possibly by promoting cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions.  The failure of either conditioned media or exogenous HB-EGF to reproduce these findings suggests that juxtacrine or tightly coupled paracrine interactions underlie this cytoprotection.

This review represents a retrospective analysis of consecutive series of cemented, total knee arthroplasties, whose annual failure and success rates were done during differing time spans. The overall success rate was not influenced by gender, age, diagnosis, or percentage of ideal body weight. Failure was considered revision or planned revision. The best and worse case scenarios were calculated for each series. Long term results of cemented, total knee arthroplasty with a relatively conforming articular surface has been shown to be a reliable procedure with excellent survivorship.

TI  - Treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction before and after the age of 1 year.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct (NLD) obstruction continues to be a subject of controversy. Some authors advocate early probing and irrigation in an office setting, whereas others recommend that the procedure be performed under general anesthesia when the child is at least 1 year old. The focus of this study was to compare the results of probing and irrigation of congenital NLD obstruction among children younger than 1 year of age, those 1 to 2 years of age, and those older than 2 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The author reviewed the records of 120 patients, ranging in age from 3 weeks to 30 years, with 153 cases of NLD obstruction. Eighty-five patients (110 cases of NLD obstruction) underwent probing and irrigation. RESULTS: Complications of NLD obstruction occurred in 12 patients; 75% of these patients were younger than 1 year of age. In group 1 (patient age < 1 year) there were 37 probings with 1 failure (3%). Group 2 (patient age = 1-2 years) had 43 probings and 5 failures (12%). In group 3 (patient age > 2 years), 30 NLDs were probed with 2 failures (7%). However, these differences were not significant (P = .13 between groups 1 and 2; P = .42 between groups 1 and 3). CONCLUSION: In this study, the postponement of probing and irrigation for congenital NLD obstruction beyond the age of 1 year did not result in an increased rate of failures or complications.

TI  - Lactate compared with pH analysis at fetal scalp blood sampling: a prospective randomised study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal scalp blood sampling is a widely used method for assessing fetal condition in the event of ominous fetal heart rate patterns. The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the value of fetal scalp blood lactate and pH management in cases of abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate tracings. METHODS: Of 341 cases of ominous fetal heart rate patterns, 169 were randomly assigned to pH analysis, and 172 to lactate measurements. Lactate was measured using a lactate card requiring 5 microL of blood and yielding the result within 60 seconds. pH analysis was performed with an ABL 510 acid-base analyser requiring 35 microL of blood and yielding the results within 47 seconds. RESULTS: Unsuccessful fetal blood sampling procedures (no result or an unreliable result) occurred significantly more often in the pH subgroup than in the lactate subgroup (OR 16.1 with 95% CI 5.8-44.7). In the pH subgroup the failure rate was inversely related to the degree of cervical dilatation. Compared with the pH subgroup, the lactate subgroup was characterised by fewer fetal scalp incisions per blood sampling attempt (median 1.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 1-1] vs 2.0 [IQR 1-2]), and significantly less time required for the sampling procedure (median 120 s [IQR 90-147] vs 230 s [IQR 180-300]). The groups did not differ in mode of delivery, neonatal outcome and umbilical artery acid-base balance and lactate levels. CONCLUSION: This trial showed the levels of lactate and pH in fetal scalp blood to be comparable in predicting perinatal outcome, but the procedure to measuring lactate was more successful than that for pH. Owing to its simplicity of performance, lactate analysis is an attractive alternative for intrapartum fetal monitoring.

TI  - Is a rising caesarean section rate inevitable?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the indications for singleton caesarean sections in Scotland in 1994. DESIGN: Prospective survey of singleton caesarean sections using information provided by clinicians entering data onto a computer in labour wards. SETTING: Twenty-three consultant-led obstetric units in Scotland. POPULATION: Women undergoing caesarean section in participating Scottish maternity units during 1994. RESULTS: Using routinely collected data it was found that the caesarean section rate varied by maternal age, parity, gestation, history of previous section and hospital of delivery, but there was no difference by area of deprivation. 87.4% (8369/9573) of Scottish caesarean sections were included in the survey of which 8098 were in women with singleton pregnancies. Most singleton caesarean sections were undertaken in primiparae (50.5%), 31.2% were in women with a history of previous section and 18.3% were in multiparous women who had not had a previous section; 38.9% of the operations were elective, 13.9% were emergencies before labour and 47.2% were emergencies during labour. Four main indications--elective section for breech presentation (10.7% of all sections); emergency caesarean section before labour because of fetal problems (2.8%); emergency caesarean section during labour for fetal distress and/or failure to progress (30.3%); repeat section for reasons other than above (16.2%) accounted for 60% of all caesarean sections in women with no other recorded complications. 7.7% of all singleton caesarean sections (19.8% of elective operations) were associated with maternal request for the operation. DISCUSSION: The survey has identified why caesarean sections are performed by Scottish obstetricians and highlighted some areas where there would be scope to increase the vaginal delivery rate. Before this can be attempted, agreement must be reached by clinicians about effective management of particular problems. Women also need to have ready access to evidenced-based information about caesarean section.

TI  - Effects of combined low dose of the isoflavone derivative ipriflavone and estrogen replacement on bone mineral density and metabolism in postmenopausal women.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the pattern of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and vertebral bone mineral density in early postmenopausal women treated with combined ipriflavone and low dose conjugated estrogens. METHODS: Bone biochemical markers and vertebral bone density were evaluated in a longitudinal, comparative, 2 year study conducted in postmenopausal women treated with sole calcium supplementation (500 mg/day), or with either ipriflavone (IP) at the standard dose (600 mg/day) plus the same calcium dose, low dose conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.3 mg/day) plus calcium, or low dose IP (400 mg/day) plus low dose CE (0.3 mg/day) plus calcium. The results were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance, as appropriate. RESULTS: No modifications of both urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and plasma osteocalcin levels were observed in calcium and in CE-treated women, while vertebral bone density significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in both groups. In IP or IP + CE-treated women, plasma osteocalcin did not show any modification, while urinary hydroxyproline showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease, that paralleled a significant (P < 0.05) increase in vertebral bone density. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal IP administration, at the standard dose of 600 mg/day, can prevent the increase in bone turnover and the decrease in bone density that follow ovarian failure. The same effect can be obtained with the combined administration of low dose (400 mg/day) IP with low dose (0.3 mg/day) CE.

TI  - Three-year experience with modular stent-graft devices for endovascular AAA treatment.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate feasibility and present early results of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) exclusion using modular stent-grafts. METHODS: In a 3-year period ending July 1997, 201 patients were treated with self-expanding stent-grafts for AAAs with infrarenal necks > or = 10 to 15 mm long and < or = 32 mm wide; subtotal mural thrombus, calcification, and even angulation to some extent were acceptable, as were iliac arteries up to 18 mm wide. The patients were treated with either the Stentor/Vanguard device (178 cases) or the Talent endograft (23 cases). Follow-up on all patients was conducted at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: The technical aneurysm exclusion rate was 89% (178/201). There were 18 primary endoleaks (9.0%; 2 proximal, 16 distal), 4 (2.0%) conversions to open surgery, and 1 (0.5%) failure to deploy the graft. Seven (3.5%) patients died in the perioperative period, 5 due to multiorgan failure early in the series and two of hemorrhagic complications. Five (2.5%) renal artery occlusions were encountered; in one case, the graft was removed after 3 weeks. Nineteen late endoleaks were found in follow-up, related primarily to the iliac limb graft extensions of the Stentor device, graft material problems, or unknown causes. To date, 10 primary and 13 secondary endoleaks have been treated endovascularly. Twenty (10.0%) graft-limb thromboses were treated either by thrombolysis, thrombectomy, or a femorofemoral bypass. CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular grafting is technically feasible and becomes easier with improvements of the introducer systems and the grafts. The seemingly high complication rate in this series is due to the liberal patient selection criteria.

TI  - Frozen oral hydration as an alternative to conventional enteral fluids.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral hydration therapy is effective in dehydration, but is often bypassed or may fail. OBJECTIVE: To compare the tolerance (amount accepted minus amount vomited) of a frozen solution (FS) (Revital-ICE, PTS Labs, Deerfield, Ill) with the conventional glucose electrolyte solution (CS). DESIGN: Prospective, controlled crossover trial. SETTING: Pediatric emergency department. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 91 children with enteritis, 6 months to 13 years of age, with mild or moderate dehydration. INTERVENTION: Children were offered either FS or CS. Each group was offered 10 mL/kg of either product during a 90-minute trial period, in 3 equal aliquots, and was monitored for the quantities consumed and vomited. Complete treatment failures (absolute refusal) were crossed over to the alternate product and intake was recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tolerance of the full 10 mL/kg of the original product offered and, for treatment failures, the percentage who tolerated the alternate product. RESULTS: Of the patients who initially received FS, 23 (55%) tolerated the full amount offered, compared with 5 (11%) in the CS group (P < .001). Of the 57% who completely refused CS, after crossover, 20% tolerated the full amount of FS and 33% tolerated between 5 and 9 mL/kg of FS and were discharged from the hospital. The original treatment failures for FS (12%) were crossed over to CS; none tolerated more than 5 mL/kg CONCLUSIONS: Children with mild or moderate dehydration are more likely to tolerate FS than CS.  Conventional solution failures crossed over to FS had a greater tolerance rate than the reverse.

TI  - The herpes simplex virus type 1 cleavage/packaging protein, UL32, is involved in efficient localization of capsids to replication compartments.  
AB  - Six genes, including UL32, have been implicated in the cleavage and packaging of herpesvirus DNA into preassembled capsids. We have isolated a UL32 insertion mutant which is capable of near-wild-type levels of viral DNA synthesis; however, the mutant virus is unable to cleave and package viral DNA, consistent with the phenotype of a previously isolated temperature-sensitive herpes simplex virus type 1 mutant, tsN20 (P. A. Schaffer, G. M. Aron, N. Biswal, and M. Benyesh-Melnick, Virology 52:57-71, 1973). A polyclonal antibody which recognizes UL32 was previously used by Chang et al. (Y. E. Chang, A. P. Poon, and B. Roizman, J. Virol. 70:3938-3946, 1996) to demonstrate that UL32 accumulates predominantly in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In this report, a functional epitope-tagged version of UL32 showed that while UL32 is predominantly cytoplasmic, some nuclear staining which colocalizes with the major DNA binding protein (ICP8, UL29) in replication compartments can be detected. We have also used a monoclonal antibody (5C) specific for the hexon form of major capsid protein VP5 to study the distribution of capsids during infection. In cells infected with wild-type KOS (6 and 8 h postinfection), 5C staining patterns indicate that capsids are present in nuclei within replication compartments. These results suggest that cleavage and packaging occur in replication compartments at least at 6 and 8 h postinfection. Cells infected with the UL32 mutant exhibit a hexon staining pattern which is more diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and which is not restricted to replication compartments. We propose that UL32 may play a role in "bringing" preassembled capsids to the sites of DNA packaging and that the failure to localize to replication compartments may explain the cleavage/packaging defect exhibited by this mutant. These results suggest that the UL32 protein is required at a step distinct from those at which other cleavage and packaging proteins are required and may be involved in the correct localization of capsids within infected cells.

TI  - Review of 10-year results of PCA hip arthroplasty.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term results of the PCA uncemented total hip replacement. DESIGN: A prospective nonrandomized clinical trial. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 11 years (mean 10.3 years). SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred consecutive PCA arthroplasties were performed on 89 patients. All operations were supervised by a single surgeon. The patients' status was reviewed between September and November 1996 by an independent observer. Seventy-three total hip replacements were available for review. INTERVENTION: PCA uncemented acetabular and femoral replacement through a lateral surgical approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The need for revision, which was classified as failure, and definite 3-zone acetabular radiolucency, which was considered radiologic evidence of loosening. RESULTS: The time to failure of the acetabulum averaged 8 years. Femoral failure occurred in 3 patients an average of 4 years postoperatively. The overall failure rate for the acetabulum was 13% and for the femur 7%. CONCLUSIONS: The acetabular failure rate is unacceptably high. Patients who have had hip replacement with the PCA prosthesis should be followed over the long term.

TI  - Lymphocytes in the human gastric mucosa during Helicobacter pylori have a T helper cell 1 phenotype.  
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies have shown that gastric T cells are increased during Helicobacter pylori infection. The purpose of this study was to characterize the human gastric T-cell responses in the presence or absence of H. pylori. METHODS: T-cell surface antigens were examined by immunohistochemistry or after isolation for evaluation of surface antigens and cytoplasmic cytokines using flow cytometry. RESULTS: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in situ during infection with H. pylori. Freshly isolated gastric T cells expressed cytoplasmic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2 after a brief stimulation. Simultaneous four-color flow cytometry demonstrated that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressed IFN-gamma. Because stimulation through CD30 favors the induction of IL-5 and Th2 cells, gastric and colonic T cells were examined for CD30 expression. Consistent with the notion that Th2 cells are found in the intestine, CD30 was evident throughout the lamina propria of the colon but was virtually absent in the stomach. Furthermore, freshly isolated gastric T cells produced little IL-4 and virtually no IL-5 or tumor necrosis factor beta. CONCLUSIONS: These observations show that gastric T cells resemble the Th1 type, which may explain their failure to induce immunity to H. pylori and their ability to contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric disease.

The inhibition of the veratridine-induced, omega-CTx GVIA- and omega-AgaTx IVA-resistant increase in [Ca2+]i by mibefradil and the failure of KB-R 7943 to inhibit this response are compatible with the suggestion that in rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes, Ca2+ influx via the R-type Ca2+ channel and/or another so far uncharacterized Ca2+ channel may substantially contribute to the veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.

TI  - Involvement of different calcium channels in K+- and veratridine-induced increases of cytosolic calcium concentration in rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes.  
AB  - Intracellular calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes were measured, using the calcium chelating fluorescence dye fura-2. The synaptosomes were depolarized by elevation of the extracellular K+ concentration or by addition of veratridine, which opens voltage-dependent Na+-channels and prevents their inactivation. Both enhancement of the concentration of extracellular K+ (up to 60 mM) and veratridine (1-100 microM) increased the [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the K+- and veratridine-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were abolished, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i was due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of the voltage-dependent Na+ channel, inhibited the veratridine-induced (10 microM) Ca2+ influx by more than 80%, while the K+-evoked (30 mM) increase of [Ca2+]i was TTX-resistant. Both the K+- and the veratridine-induced Ca2+ influx were not reduced by nifedipine (1 microM), a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels. Blockade of the voltage dependent N-type Ca2+ channels with omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CTx GVIA; 0.1 microM) and of the voltage-dependent P/Q-type channels with omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-AgaTx IVA; 0.2 microM) inhibited the K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by about 30 and 55%, respectively; these effects were additive. Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CTx MVIIC) at a concentration of 0.2 microM, which may be assumed to block predominantly the Q-type Ca2+ channel, inhibited the K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 50%. The veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced by about 25% by omega-CTx GVIA (0.1 microM), but was resistant to omega-AgaTx IVA (0.2 microM) and omega-CTx MVIIC (0.2 omegaM). Mibefradil (former designation Ro 40-5967), a Ca2+ antagonist which blocks all types of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels including the T and R channels, led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of the K+- and veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (abolition at 10 microM mibefradil). Ifenprodil, another non-specific blocker of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, also inhibited the K+- and veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in concentration-dependent manner and abolished it at 320 microM ifenprodil. In contrast, KB-R 7943 (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulphonate; 1 and 3 microM), a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1), failed to inhibit the K+- and veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. It is concluded that the K+-induced increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ results from Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent N- and, above all, Q-type Ca2+ channels. N-type Ca2+ channels also play a minor role in the veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, but P/Q-type channels do not appear to be involved at all. The inhibition of the veratridine-induced, omega-CTx GVIA- and omega-AgaTx IVA-resistant increase in [Ca2+]i by mibefradil and the failure of KB-R 7943 to inhibit this response are compatible with the suggestion that in rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes, Ca2+ influx via the R-type Ca2+ channel and/or another so far uncharacterized Ca2+ channel may substantially contribute to the veratridine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.

TI  - Epidemiology of acute renal failure and outcome of haemodiafiltration in intensive care.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiology of acute renal failure (ARF) and to identify predictors of mortality in patients treated by continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). DESIGN: Uncontrolled observational study. SETTING: One intensive care unit (ICU) at a surgical and trauma centre. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 3591 ICU treatments. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Demographic data, indications for ICU admission, severity scores and organ system failure at the beginning of CVVHDF were set against the occurrence of ARF and ICU mortality. 154 (4.3% of ICU patients and 0.6% of the hospital population) developed ARF and were treated with CVVHDF. Higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status and higher Apache II score were associated with ICU incidence of ARF. However, these criteria were not able to predict outcome in ARF. A simplified predictive model was derived using multivariate logistic regression modelling. The mortality rates were 12% with one failing organ system (OSF), 38% with two OSF, 72% with three OSF, 90% with four OSF and 100% with five OSF. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death was 7.7 for cardiovascular failure, 6.3 for hepatic failure, 3.6 for respiratory failure, 3.0 for neurologic failure, 5.3 for massive transfusion and 3.7 for age of 60 years or more. CONCLUSION: General measures of severity are not useful in predicting the outcome of ARF. Only the nature and number of dysfunctioning organ systems and massive transfusion at the beginning of CVVHDF and the age of the patients gave a reliable prognosis in this group of patients.

TI  - Causes of recurrence after laparoscopic hernioplasty. A multicenter study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine if there are common factors beyond the learning curve that lead to recurrence after laparoscopic hernioplasty, we analyzed failures seen in seven centers specializing in laparoscopic hernia repair. METHOD: We performed a retrospective review of patients who had a laparoscopic hernioplasty (Tapp or Tep) between 1990 and 1996 at centers specializing in laparoscopic repairs (>500 repairs at each center). RESULTS: In all, 7661 patients had 10,053 hernias repaired by the transabdominal preperitoneal or the totally extraperitoneal approach; they were followed for 1 month to 6 years. In patients followed for >/=6 months with a median follow-up of 36 months, 35 repairs failed (0.4%), and all but one of these patients underwent a remedial operation. Twenty-nine had a laparoscopic repair, four had a combined laparoscopic and anterior repair, and one had an anterior repair alone. The cause of failure was determined in all 34 patients. The mechanism of recurrence was inadequate lateral fixation of the mesh in 11 cases, inadequate lateral fixation compounded by too small a mesh in three cases, missed lipoma of the cord in four cases, inadequate fixation of the mesh medially to Cooper's ligament in eight cases (seven of which were associated with too small a mesh), a missed hernia in four cases, and a hernia through a keyhole in the mesh in five cases. As surgeons gained experience, the incidence of recurrence due to missed hernias or too small a mesh decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This large multicenter study demonstrated that the incidence of recurrence after laparoscopic hernioplasty performed by experienced surgeons was extremely low and that some causes could be corrected by experience, whereas others will require changes in technique or equipment.

TI  - Significance and management of early graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting: feasibility and results of acute angiography and re-re-vascularization.  
AB  - Perioperative ischaemia and infarction after CABG are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To study causes of perioperative ischaemia and infarction by acute re-angiography and to treat incomplete re-vascularization caused by graft failure or any other cause. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 2003 patients underwent an isolated CABG operation. Myocardial ischaemia was suspected if one or more of the following criteria were present: New changes in the ST-segment in the ECG; a CKMB value greater than 80 U/L; new Q-waves in the ECG; recurrent episodes of, or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia; ventricular fibrillation; haemodynamic deterioration and left ventricular failure. Acute coronary angiography was performed in stable patients, while haemodynamically severely compromised patients were rushed to the operating room. RESULTS: A total of 71 (3.5%) patients of all CABGs with suspected graft failure were identified and included in the study. Patients were grouped according to whether they had an acute re-angiography (n = 59; group 1) or an immediate re-operation (n = 12; group 2) performed. In group 1, the acute re-angiography demonstrated graft failure/incomplete re-vascularization in 43 patients (73%). The angiographic findings were: Occluded vein graft(s) in 19 (32%); poor distal run-off to the grafted coronary artery in ten (17%); internal mammary artery stenosis in four (7%); internal mammary artery occlusion in three (5%); vein graft stenoses in three (5%); left mammary artery subclavian artery steal in two (3%); and the wrong coronary artery grafted in one (2%). Based on the angiography findings, 27 patients were re-operated and re-grafted. At the time of re-operation, 18 patients (67%) had evolving infarction documented by ECG or CKMB. Two patients (3%) experienced stroke in immediate relation to the re-angiography. The 30-day mortality was three (7%). In group 2, graft occlusions were found in 11 patients (92%). The 30-day mortality was six (50%). CONCLUSION: An acute re-angiography demonstrated graft failure or incomplete re-vascularization in the majority of patients with myocardial ischaemia early after CABG. Re-operation for re-re-vascularization was performed with low risk. Few patients with circulatory collapse could be saved by an immediate re-operation without preceding angiography.

AB  - The population in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than increases in food production, resulting in a net decrease in food production per capita. The Food and Agriculture Organization has stated that there is a "risk of widespread hunger" which could be prevented by "effective planning of water resources". However, the potential effects of such schemes on the human population are often inadequately assessed and the effect of large dams on human health is not clear. The potential risk to human health of water resources was emphasized a few years ago but no effective preventive programs were implemented, probably because of inadequate availability of information and lack of awareness. The effects on health of "large" water resource projects are not uniform within a population. Decision-makers have tended to focus on the positive effects, to obtain support for their plans. These include: 1) improvement in the well-being of the population (safe water more readily available, new infrastructure, better access to health care) and 2) increases in the food supply (more vegetables and fish available due to irrigation). Thus, there has been a logical expectation that more, better quality food will become available as a result of these schemes, whereas in fact, health and nutrition has often worsened, particularly in young children. Most of the diseases associated with water resource management are communicable, including diseases directly related to the presence of large quantities of water, such as: malaria, which increases in incidence immediately after the building of the dam, after which a new balance develops between the human population and the parasites, schistosomiasis, the disease which increases most in response to the building of dams, particularly in its most severe gastrointestinal form, diarrhea, as water is a major means of dissemination for many organisms, including those causing digestive tract infections and gastroenteritis (amebiasis, salmonellosis, cholera), due to poor sanitation, other parasitic infections, such as onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis, which should be monitored as they may also threaten the population. Other communicable diseases may appear or increase in incidence with the influx of migrants to the irrigated area. Sexually-transmitted diseases and HIV infection are a particular problem. The large numbers of insects (mosquitoes, blackflies) may also have harmful effects on populations adapting to the new environment. These effects are related to each other and to the environmental changes. New types of food affect people's feeding habits and generate new sources of income. However, they may also lead to new and higher expenditure. There are also likely to be major socio-demographic changes associated with changes in reproductive behavior and women's activities. The location and nature of new homes and infrastructure (e.g. schools, health centers, roads) also contribute to the success or failure of the dam project. There are many constraints to be considered and a more comprehensive approach to the problem is required. Health and nutritional status may be used as simple indicators of the ability of the population to adapt to a new environment. This makes it possible to construct a causal model to identify the most effective and relevant areas of intervention. Health and nutrition issues are of vital importance and scientific findings should be used in decision-making processes for planning future large dam schemes.

TI  - Phase II trial of chemoembolization for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma to the liver and review of the literature.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery chemoembolization represents an alternative treatment for patients whose neoplastic lesions are not amenable or have become refractory to other treatment modalities. This project was designed to test the feasibility of regional chemoembolization for patients with colorectal carcinoma metastasis to the liver who had experienced failure with one or more systemic treatments. METHODS: Thirty patients who met the study entry criteria underwent one to three hepatic artery chemoembolizations. The chemoembolization regimen consisted of an injection of a bovine collagen material with cisplatin (10 mg/mL), doxorubicin (3 mg/mL), and mitomycin C (3 mg/mL). Repeat treatments were performed at 6- to 8-week intervals. RESULTS: Radiologic responses, as measured by a decrease in lesion density of at least 75% of the lesion or a 25% decrease in the size of the lesion, occurred in 63% of the cases. A decrease of at least 25% of the baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level occurred in 95% of the cases. All responses were transient. Median survival for all 30 patients was 8.6 months after the initiation of chemoembolization and 29 months after the initial diagnosis of metastasis to the liver. Common toxicities included a "postembolization syndrome," which consisted of fever > 101 degrees F (83%), pain in the right upper quadrant (100%), nausea, and vomiting. Lethargy was a common occurrence (in 60+% of cases) and lasted up to 6 weeks. Hematologic toxicities included leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Chemoembolization is a feasible treatment modality for patients with colorectal carcinoma metastasis to the liver who have experienced failure with other systemic treatments. It results in high response rates with transient mild-to-moderate toxicity. Responses are measured in months, however, and all patients have eventual progression of disease. Patients who are able to undergo three or more chemoembolization procedures may receive the most clinical benefit.

TI  - Parasite-mediated steps in immune response failure during primary Theileria annulata infection.  
AB  - "Exotic" European cattle are highly susceptible to T. annulata infection. In immunised animals, several effective anti-parasite responses can be demonstrated, such as anti-macroschizont cytotoxic T cells (CTL), and nitric oxide killing of parasites.  The failure of infected animals to mount an effective primary immune response suggests that the presence of the parasite directly interferes with the development of immunity. When the activation pathways of CD4+ T cells in draining lymph nodes were examined during the course of a primary infection it was found that the development of this essential arm of the immune response was altered. Instead of interacting with antigen presenting cells in the paracortex, the majority of CD4+ T cells were rapidly activated by developing infected cells in the medulla of the node. Activation of T cells by infected cells also drastically alters the cytokines produced by the T cells. During effective immune responses, the principal cytokine involved appears to be IL-2, with only small, controlled "bursts" of IFN gamma production. However, IL-2 responsiveness is only transient in animals undergoing primary infection, while IFNg production is greatly elevated. IFN gamma does not appear to control parasitised cells, and may even aid the growth of infected macrophages--large numbers of macrophages enter the cell cycle during the peak period of IFN gamma production. Uncontrolled parasite-induced IFN gamma production is also likely to account for the local failure of antibody responses. Germinal centres in infected lymph nodes lose normal morphology, with IFN gamma sensitive zones failing to develop. A third strategy which the parasite uses to evade immune response destruction is through affecting CTL activity. CTL in infected draining lymph nodes lose expression of the adhesion molecule CD2--a molecule is essential in adherence to target cells for lysis. CD2- CTL are unable to lyse macroschizont infected cells.

TI  - Healing of the anterior attachment of the rabbit meniscus to bone.  
AB  - In a rabbit model the healing process of the anterior attachment of the medical meniscus was observed during the first 12 weeks after sharp transection and refixation in a tibial bone channel. Evaluations of the healing tissue were histologic analysis, application of immunohistochemical methods to show collagen types and nerve regeneration, and mechanical load to failure tests. Secondary changes to knee joint cartilage, as signs of eventual dysfunction of the refixed meniscus, were evaluated by analysis of proteoglycan fragment concentration in joint fluid and histologic analysis of knee joint articular cartilage and synovium. The healing tissue between the refixed attachment and bone matured from highly cellular, nonspecific granulation tissue at 1 week, to bone, fibrocartilaginous, and fibrous tissues, which at some sites developed an insertion specific tissue arrangement within a 12-week period. However, the irregular interface between the fibrocartilaginous tissue and the underlying bone, which is typical for a normal insertion, was not reestablished. Labeling for collagen Types I and II in the newly formed insertion did not return to normal. In addition a few collagen fibers connected the refixed attachment tissue to bone. New bone formation turned the initially cancellous bone tunnel walls into more solid cortical bone. However, new bone formation did not fill the distal part of the channel. The refixed meniscal attachment underwent necrosis and was revitalized by cell ingrowth from the periphery. Nerve fibers were found in the newly formed insertion by 12 weeks. The failure load at tensile testing never reached more than 20% that of a normal attachment. Degeneration of articular cartilage and increased proteoglycan fragment in the joint fluid were common after this procedure. These data suggest that, despite the focal appearance of insertion specific tissues and healing of collagen fibers to bone, the tissue architecture of a normal meniscal insertion and a normal meniscal joint protective function were not reestablished.

TI  - Acute pulmonary exacerbation is not associated with increased energy expenditure in children with cystic fibrosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to document alterations in resting energy expenditure (REE), energy intake, and body composition that occur during admission for management of a pulmonary exacerbation in children with cystic fibrosis. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of 14 children with cystic fibrosis (8 male, 12.5 +/- 3.3 years) was conducted throughout a 14-day hospitalization and again 3 weeks after discharge. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine the change in variables across time. RESULTS: Significant increases were documented from days 1 to 14 in weight (37.1 +/- 13.1 kg to 38.4 +/- 13.5 kg) and pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 67.6% +/- 19.8% to 78.5% +/- 24.5%). Energy intake was not different between hospitalization and follow-up and averaged 175% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance. REE on day 1 was elevated (122% +/- 11% predicted); however, when expressed with fat free mass as a covariate, no significant changes were noted in REE throughout the eight measurements. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that an acute pulmonary exacerbation is not associated with an increase above a subject's baseline REE in children with cystic fibrosis with mild to moderate lung disease. Management of an acute pulmonary exacerbation should be associated with sustained improvement in pulmonary function and nutritional status; in contrast, weight loss or failure to improve pulmonary function should be seen as atypical.

TI  - [Efficacy of granisetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]  
AB  - One hundred and eleven patients receiving conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were administered a single intravenous dose (40 micrograms/kg) of granisetron before chemo-radio therapy. The efficacy of the drug was assessed every 24 hours, rating the control of nausea and vomiting as complete, major, minor or failure. On day 1, 23 of 48 patients (47.9%) who received cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day), achieved control of emesis with complete or major response. On day 2, 17 of 47 patients (36.2%) achieved control emesis. During total body irradiation (TBI) (10 approximately 12 Gy/2 approximately 3 days), 21 of 33 patients (63.6%) achieved control of emesis on day 1 and 22 of 32 patients (68.6%) achieved control of emesis on day 2. During melphalan administration (60 approximately 100 mg/m2/day), 20 of 28 patients (71.4%) achieved control of emesis on day 1. Adverse effects were observed in seven patients but were not serious. We concluded that granisetron has a major role in preparation for HSCT.

TI  - [Comparison of internal fixation methods for the symphysis in multi-directional dynamic gait simulation]  
AB  - For the stabilization of the ruptured pubic symphysis, rigid forms of fixation such as plate osteosynthesis and flexible fixations such as wire loops or PDS banding have been recommended. All methods have only been tested by static unidirectional loading until failure of the system. By this experimental arrangement Ecke and Hofmann found comparable results for flexible and rigid methods of internal stabilization of the pubic symphysis. They preferred flexible methods to maintain mobility of the symphysis and to prevent symphyseal fusion. We tested dynamic compression plate osteosynthesis, reconstruction plate osteosynthesis, wire loops and PDS banding for internal fixation of injured pubic symphysis in a dynamic multidirectional experimental arrangement simulating gait conditions. The specimens were loaded with 85 N in vertical (y-) direction and 34 N in sagittal (z-) direction, which represent 50% of the forces acting at the pubic symphysis during walking and with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 loads simulating the conditions over a 6-week mobilization period. Loading with 100% of the acting forces (corresponding to full weight bearing mobilization) led to early failure of the system. Our experimental analysis showed that neither wire loops nor PDS banding is able to stabilize the ruptured pubic symphysis, even immediately after fixation before loading. During the tests instability increased until failure of the system due to cutting of the bone or breaking of the wires or PDS banding. Success of plate osteosynthesis was dependent on the initial stability of the fixation. Overwinding of the screws, as in osteoporotic bone, lead to increasing loosening during repeated loading, whereas primary stable fixation of the screws was almost completely maintained during the test. In consequence, neither wire loops nor PDS banding should be used for stabilization of injured pubic symphysis if early mobilization with partial weight bearing is desired. Plate osteosynthesis (DC or reconstruction plate) tolerates early half weight bearing in patients with "open-book" injury only if safe screw fixation is guaranteed.

TI  - Effect of heavy metals on Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae.  
AB  - Studies were conducted to determine the biological effects of heavy metals on the development of Aedes aegypti. Embryos immersed in 32 ppm Cu or 5 ppm Cd did not hatch. The arrest of hatching was in part reversible by removal of the heavy metals. The mortality rate of third-instar larvae exposed to heavy metals for 24 h was metal and dose dependent; the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) endpoints were 3.1, 16.5, and 33 ppm for Hg, Cd, and Cu, respectively. Interestingly, a proportion of Aedes aegypti third-instar larvae exposed to either Cu or Cd for 24 h failed to produce a dissectable peritrophic matrix.  This failure to produce a dissectable peritrophic matrix also was metal and dose dependent. These results are discussed in the context of Aedes aegypti as a model system for investigating the molecular biological effects of heavy metals in aquatic insects.

TI  - A review of free flap failures in the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur.  
AB  - Sixty-one free flaps performed in 59 patients from April 1983 to April 1995 were analysed. Various factors that might have affected the outcome of the surgery were studied. These included the patient's age, history of smoking, pre-existing medical problems such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the type of free flaps, flap infection, use of postoperative anticoagulation, postoperative anaemia and re-exploration. The infection rate was 16.4% and this had a strong correlation with the free flap failure in our study population. Postoperative anaemia could adversely affect the tissue oxygenation of the free flap and delay the re-exploration due to the high anaesthetic risk. Dextran was routinely used for postoperative anticoagulation. There were also rescue attempts using heparin infusion when needed. The overall failure rate was 13.1%. Besides good anaesthetic support, a well-prepared protocol is necessary both for the preoperative planning of free flap surgery as well as salvaging a failure.

Random length porcine bone plugs were assigned to fixation with 7 or 9 mm Kurosaka screws. Peak load to failure was determined. There was a significant decrease in peak load to failure of the 5-mm long bone plugs compared with longer bone plugs. No difference was found between longer lengths of bone plug in either the 7- or 9-mm screw diameter groups. The 9-mm diameter screws significantly increased peak load to failure for both 1- and 2-cm bone plug lengths.

TI  - Systematic review of dietary intervention trials to lower blood total cholesterol in free-living subjects [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the efficacy of dietary advice to lower blood total cholesterol concentration in free-living subjects and to investigate the efficacy of different dietary recommendations. DESIGN: Systematic overview of 19 randomised controlled trials including 28 comparisons. SUBJECTS: Free-living subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Individualised dietary advice to modify fat intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage difference in blood total cholesterol concentration between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The percentage reduction in blood total cholesterol attributable to dietary advice after at least six months of intervention was 5.3% (95% confidence interval 4.7% to 5.9%). Including both short and long duration studies, the effect was 8.5% at 3 months and 5.5% at 12 months. Diets equivalent to the step 2 diet of the American Heart Association were of similar efficacy to diets that aimed to lower total fat intake or to raise the polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio. These diets were moderately more effective than the step 1 diet of the American Heart Association (6.1% v 3.0% reduction in blood total cholesterol concentration; P<0.0001). On the basis of reported food intake, the targets for dietary change were seldom achieved. The observed reductions in blood total cholesterol concentrations in the individual trials were consistent with those predicted from dietary intake on the basis of the Keys equation. CONCLUSIONS: Individualised dietary advice for reducing cholesterol concentration is modestly effective in free-living subjects. More intensive diets achieve a greater reduction in serum cholesterol concentration.  Failure to comply fully with dietary recommendations is the likely explanation for this limited efficacy.

TI  - Back-up bone marrow is frequently ineffective in patients with poor peripheral-blood stem-cell mobilization.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess hematologic recovery and procedure-related mortality in patients who received high-dose therapy with stem-cell support, in whom the peripheral-blood stem-cell (PBSC) collection fails (CD34+ cells < 1 x 10(6)/kg).The predictive value of granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming cell (GM-CFC) measurements and the value of bone marrow obtained after PBSC collection failure was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 324 consecutive patients mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and cyclophosphamide (273 patients), G-CSF with other chemotherapy (37 patients), and G-CSF alone (14 patients). Between one and four aphereses were performed. RESULTS: In 51 of 324 patients, there was failure to obtain 1 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells. Twenty-three patients had greater than 1 x 10(5)/kg GM-CFC; 22 patients proceeded to high-dose therapy. Neutrophil recovery occurred within 21 days, but platelet independence was delayed (> 28 days) in eight patients. Of 28 patients with less than 1 x 10(5)/kg GM-CFC, six received high-dose therapy with PBSC alone and five had delayed engraftment. Twelve patients with less than 1 x 10(5)/kg GM-CFC received high-dose therapy supported by bone marrow collected after PBSC collection failure. Eleven patients were assessable for engraftment; four patients had slow (> 21 days) or delayed (> 28 days) neutrophil recovery and eight patients had delayed platelet recovery. In the group of patients who received less than 1 x 10(5)/kg GM-CFC, there were five procedure-related deaths. CONCLUSION: This study shows that delayed hematologic recovery is frequent if less than 1 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells are infused after high-dose therapy, particularly with GM-CFC less than 1 x 10(5)/kg. The procedure-related mortality in this latter group is high. In most patients whose PBSC collection contains less than 1 x 10(5)/kg GM-CFC, the use of bone marrow cells does not improve engraftment, which suggests that poor PBSC mobilization usually indicates poor marrow function.

AB  - We report two laboratory experiments which compare two competing explanations of performance deficits following failure: one based on Seligman's learned helplessness theory (LHT), and the other, on self-esteem protection theory (SEPT). In both studies, participants (Study 1: N = 40 pupils from secondary schools in Walbrzych, Poland; Study 2: N = 45 students from the University of Bielefeld, Germany) were confronted with either success or failure in a first phase of the experiment. Then, in the second phase of the experiment the participants had to work on a set of mathematical problems (Study 1) or a set of tasks taken from Raven's Progressive Matrices (Study 2) either privately or in public. In both studies failure in the first phase causes performance deficits in the second phase only if the participants had to solve the test tasks in public. These results were interpreted in line with SEPT and as incompatible with LHT.

TI  - Experimental right ventricle to pulmonary artery discontinuity: outcome of polyurethane valved conduits.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ideal substitute for the treatment of ventricle-pulmonary artery discontinuity remains a topic of controversy, because of calcifications and degeneration of biologic substitutes leading to subsequent reoperations. Because polyurethane valves used in ventricular assist devices show a satisfactory biocompatibility, the aim of this study was to evaluate a valved conduit composed of a Dacron graft incorporating a trileaflet 25 mm polyurethane valve. METHODS: The conduit was implanted between the right ventricle and the main pulmonary artery in adult sheep, with ligation of the proximal pulmonary artery. The animals received no medications. Serial hemodynamic data were collected at the time of implantation and at postoperative intervals of 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The peak pressure gradient across the valve increased significantly between implantation (0.17 +/- 5.6 mm Hg) and 6 months after operation (7.3 +/- 3 mm Hg, p = 0.0007) and remained stable thereafter (6.7 +/- 3 mm Hg at 12 months), whereas the cardiac output remained unchanged (4.6 +/- 0.6 L/min at implantation, 4 +/- 0.6 L/min at 6 months, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 L/min at 12 months). At the completion of the study, valve samples were processed and vapor coated with carbon for microscopic examination. There was one instance of nonadherent thrombus formation inside a cusp but no structural failures. The other valves were free of calcium deposits and no significant amounts of phosphorus could be detected by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the good hemodynamic performance, low thrombogenicity, and acceptable durability of the polyurethane valves implanted in the right side of the heart in a chronic sheep model.

TI  - One-step needle aspiration and lavage for the treatment of abdominal and pelvic abscesses [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was undertaken to show the efficacy and safety of one-step needle aspiration and lavage for the treatment of nonenteric, nonpancreatic abdominal and pelvic abscesses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two nonconsecutive patients (age range, 4-81 years old) with 97 abdominal and pelvic abscesses were treated over 16 years with a one-step percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage technique. Abscesses were drained with sonographic or CT guidance in a single session. An 18-gauge needle was used for aspiration and repeated saline lavage; no drainage catheter was left in place. For collections that appeared multiloculated, needle repositioning and repeated aspiration and lavage were performed during the single session. All patients received i.v. antibiotics. RESULTS: Eighty-seven (90%) of 97 abscesses in 72 of 82 patients were successfully treated, including 17 (85%) of 20 abscesses that were multiloculated. The only two complications were transient sepsis in one patient and hemorrhage in one patient that resolved with transfusion and conservative treatment. Needle aspiration and lavage failures were associated with diffuse peritonitis, occult malignancy, unsuspected enteric communication, and a dropped surgical clip. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage can be a safe, effective alternative to the more conventional treatment of prolonged catheter drainage. In selected patients, including certain patients with multiloculated abscesses, one-step needle aspiration and lavage should be considered as the initial method of treatment.

TI  - Induction of melanoma antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro by stimulation with B7-expressing human melanoma cell lines.  
AB  - Crosslinking of CD28 receptors on resting T lymphocytes by B7 costimulatory molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) plays a critical role in T-cell activation. Human melanomas express major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted tumor-associated antigens that can be recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), yet they remain poorly immunogenic. One mechanism for the failure of T-cell response is the lack of expression of costimulatory molecules by human melanoma cells. We have transfected the B7-1 gene into three HLA-A2-expressing human melanoma cell lines, and studied their capacity to stimulate primary human T cells. B7-expressing melanoma cells were excellent inducers of T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures through a process dependent on the function of the T-cell receptor as well as interactions between B7:CD28, CD2:LFA-3, and LFA-1:ICAM-1. Subset analysis demonstrated that CD4+ T cells or addition of exogenous interleukin-2 was required for the induction of CD8+ CTL. Untransfected parental melanoma cells were inert as APCs in these cultures. Rotating stimulation of T cells with the three B7-expressing cell lines led to the generation of T-cell lines that were cytolytic for HLA-A2+ melanoma cells and other HLA-A2+ targets that were pulsed with HLA-A2-restricted MART-1 peptides. These data demonstrate that expression of B7-1 by human melanoma cells converts them into effective APCs for the in vitro induction of MHC-restricted, melanoma-specific CTL.

TI  - [Experimental research and clinical application of homologous dura mater in ocular plastic surgery]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of the dura mater implantation in ocular plastic surgeries. METHODS: Alcohol preserved homologous dura mater was implanted into the upper fornix under the conjunctiva of rabbit eye and light, electron microscopic histological and immunological examinations were made for the implant. 38 eyes consisting of 30 eyes of blepharoptosis, 4 eyes of blepharo-coloboma, 3 eyes of hollow socket and 1 eye of teleepicanthus were treated by homologous dura mater implantation. RESULTS: In the follow-up periods ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 years, 26 eyes in the treated eyes were cured, 9 eyes were markedly improved, 3 eyes failed. Histological findings showed that after 1 week of implantation there was cell infiltration around the implant, at 2 weeks new collagenous tissue developed at the margin of the implant and 2-3 months after transplantation, the grafts were replace by the patient's own connective tissue. The histological examination of 3 failure cases showed that the cause of the failure was due to the ischemia of homograft. The results of unidirectional mixed lymphocyte culture showed that the stimulation index before implantation in comparison with that at 96 and 120 hours after implantation had statistical significant differences, while in comparison with that at 144 hours after implantation had no such difference. Before the implantation, the stimulation index of the lymphocyte culture at 96 hours was significantly different from that at 144 hours statistically (P < 0.05). In the comparison of specific killing activity before and after implantation, there was statistical significant difference. CONCLUSION: The effects of transplantation of homologous dura mater employed in ocular plastic surgeries of blepharoptosis, blepharocoloboma, teleepicanthus and hollow socket are fairly good.

TI  - Assessment of selective under-reporting of food intake by both obese and non-obese women in a metabolic facility.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the degree of bias in under-reporting of food intake in obese and non-obese subjects, hypothesising that under-reporting may be selective for either macronutrient content (carbohydrate (CHO), fat, protein, alcohol), specific food types or eating occasions (meals, snacks). DESIGN: Thirty-three women (18 obese, 15 non-obese) were recruited to a long-stay metabolic facility for 24h. Ad libitum food intake was covertly measured throughout the study and a reported food intake completed at the end of 24h. RESULTS: Reported total daily energy intake was significantly lower than measured intake. Whilst meals were accurately reported, energy from snack foods eaten between meals was significantly under-reported. (P< 0.001) Reported total carbohydrate and added sugar intakes were significantly lower than measured, whilst reported protein and fat intakes were not significantly different from measured. Reported alcohol intake was also considerably lower than measured, but high variability prevented significance. CONCLUSIONS: In both obese and non-obese women the major cause of under-reporting, as assessed by covert study design in subjects restricted within a metabolic facility, is the failure to report between-meal snack foods. There is some evidence for increased under-reporting in high CHO, but no evidence of a bias in under-reporting towards high fat or high protein foods.

TI  - Persistent vesicourethral dysfunction following radical surgery for rectal carcinoma: urodynamic features and potential abatement with modified sphincterotomy (radical transurethral resection of the prostate).  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vesicourethral function returns after radical rectal surgery during the first year but rarely progresses after 1 year. We examined the urodynamics of patients whose voiding dysfunction remained after 1 year, and treated several with a modified sphincterotomy procedure similar to radical transurethral resection of the prostate. METHODS: We analyzed the urodynamic features of vesicourethral dysfunction in 16 male patients with persistent voiding dysfunction for more than 1 year following radical surgery for rectal carcinoma. Seven patients elected to undergo radical transurethral resection of prostate (radical TUR-P) for the relief of their persistent voiding dysfunction. RESULTS: The mean bladder volume at the first desire to void was 210 mL, the mean maximal bladder capacity was 343 mL, and the mean vesical compliance (Cves) was 27.1 mL/cm H2O. All patients demonstrated either vesical denervation supersensitivity (Vds) or uninhibited contraction. The mean maximal urethral closure pressure was 43.9 cm H2O, and urethral denervation supersensitivity was found in 77.8% (7/9), and sphincter dyssynergia in 66.7% (6/9) of patients. After radical TUR-P, 5 patients became free from the use of self-catheterization, 1 patient had a reduced residual urine rate, and 1 patient was unchanged, but no patient noted a change in urinary control. CONCLUSION: Urethral dysfunction after radical rectal surgery was caused by failure of the bladder to empty along with an underactive detrusor. Radical TUR-P was effective in restoring voiding function in a selected group of these patients.

Nevertheless, with Stage IB and IIA tumors <2 cm in diameter, the pelvic failure rate was under 10% with doses of 70-80 Gy to point A, whereas for larger lesions even doses of 85-90 Gy resulted in 25% to 37% pelvic failure rates.

TI  - Tumor size, irradiation dose, and long-term outcome of carcinoma of uterine cervix.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of tumor size and extent, and dose of irradiation on pelvic tumor control, incidence of distant metastases, and disease-free survival in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records were reviewed of 1499 patients (Stages IA-IVA) treated with definitive irradiation (combination of external beam plus two intracavitary insertions to deliver doses of 65-95 Gy to point A, depending on stage and tumor volume). Follow-up was obtained in 98% of patients (median 11 years, minimum 3 years, maximum 30 years). The relationship between outcome and tumor size was analyzed in each stage. Pelvic tumor control was correlated with total doses to point A and to the lateral pelvic wall. RESULTS: The 10-year actuarial pelvic failure rate in Stage IB was 5% for tumors <2 cm, 15% for 2.1-5 cm, and 35% for tumors >5 cm (p = 0.01); in Stage IIA, the rates were 0%, 28%, and 25%, respectively (p = 0.12). Stage IIB unilateral or bilateral nonbulky tumors <5 cm had a 23% pelvic failure rate compared with 34% for unilateral or bilateral bulky tumors >5 cm (p = 0.13). In Stage IIB, pelvic failures were 18% with medial parametrial involvement only, compared with 28% when tumor extended into the lateral parametrium (p = 0.05). In Stage III, unilateral parametrial involvement was associated with a 32% pelvic failure rate versus 50% for bilateral extension (p < 0.01). Ten-year disease-free survival rates were 90% for IB tumors <2 cm, 76% for 2.1-4 cm, 61% for 4.1-5 cm, and 47% for >5 cm (p = 0.01); in Stage IIA, the rates were 93%, 63%, 39%, and 59%, respectively (p < or = 0.01). Patients with Stage IIB medial parametrial involvement had better 10-year disease-free survival (67%) than those with lateral parametrial extension (56%) (p = 0.02). Stage III patients with unilateral tumor extension had a 48% 10-year disease-free survival rate compared with 32% for bilateral parametrial involvement (p < or = 0.01). The presence of endometrial extension or tumor only in the endometrial curettings had no significant impact on pelvic failure. However, in patients with Stage IB disease, the incidence of distant metastases was 31% with positive curettings, 15% with negative curettings, and 22% with admixture (p < or = 0.01). In Stage IIA, the corresponding values were 51%, 33%, and 18% (p = 0.05). The 10-year disease-free survival rates in Stage IB were 67% with positive curettings, 81% for negative curettings, and 77% for admixture (p = 0.02); in Stage IIA, the rates were 45%, 66%, and 67%, respectively (p = 0.14). Because this is not a prospective Phase II dose-escalation study, the correlation of doses of irradiation with pelvic tumor control in the various stages and tumor size groups is not consistent. Nevertheless, with Stage IB and IIA tumors <2 cm in diameter, the pelvic failure rate was under 10% with doses of 70-80 Gy to point A, whereas for larger lesions even doses of 85-90 Gy resulted in 25% to 37% pelvic failure rates. In Stage IIB with doses of 70 Gy to point A, the pelvic failure rate was about 50% compared with about 20% in nonbulky and 30% in bulky tumors with doses > 80 Gy. In Stage III unilateral lesions, the pelvic failure rate was about 50% with < or =70 Gy to point A versus 35% with higher doses, and in bilateral or bulky tumors it was 60% with doses <70 Gy and 50% with higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical stage and size of tumor are critical factors in prognosis, therapy efficacy, and evaluation of results in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The doses to point A suggest that for lesions <2 cm, doses of 75 Gy result in < or =10% pelvic failures,

TI  - Scapholunate ligament reconstruction using a bone-retinaculum-bone autograft: a biomechanic and histologic study.  
AB  - A new surgical technique has been recently described that involves reconstruction of the dorsal aspect of the scapholunate ligament (DSLL) with a bone-retinaculum-bone (BRB) autograft preparation from Lister's tubercle. In this study, the mechanic and histologic properties of the 2 tissues were compared. The BRB and DSLL specimens were harvested from 6 fresh-frozen human cadaveric forearms. The specimens were measured and then tested in tension with an MTS 810 servohydraulic materials testing machine at a rate of 10 mm/min. The BRB autograft was significantly weaker than the DSLL. However, because the mean cross-sectional area of the DSLL was more than 3 times as large as that of the BRB autograft, the failure stress (failure force/cross-sectional area) of the BRB autograft was not significantly different from that of the DSLL. Histologically, the DSLL and BRB autograft were also similar. These findings suggest that the BRB autograft may be appropriate graft material for scapholunate ligament reconstruction, but that structural parity with DSLL will ultimately depend on remodeling and hypertrophy during healing. This also highlights the importance of using a large BRB autograft to approximate the strength of the DSLL as much as possible, and that the BRB autograft must be protected postoperatively as it heals and remodels.

TI  - Correlation between biomechanical and structural changes during the regeneration of skeletal muscle after laceration injury.  
AB  - A standardized and reliable model for muscle laceration injuries was developed. The biomechanical and morphological changes during the process of muscle repair after injury were analysed, and the reproducibility of the methods was evaluated. The soleus muscles of Sprague-Dawley rats were completely transected and were allowed to heal for 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, or 56 days, when the muscles either were pulled to failure to measure different parameters of tensile strength or were removed for morphological analysis. During the repair process, the regenerating myofibers penetrated into the connective-tissue scar and formed new myotendinous junctions, thus restoring the functional continuity across the muscle stumps. The muscle atrophied significantly during the recovery period. Mechanical failure occurred in the scar until day 10, and thereafter it occurred within myofibers. Until day 10, the failure load, strain, and specific energy increased to as much as 46, 59, and 36% of the control level, respectively; thereafter, there were only minor changes. Stress (tensile strength per cross-sectional area) reached 86% of the control level by day 21 and further increased to as much as 96% of the control level until day 56. These results indicate that the scar becomes stronger than muscle within 14 days; thereafter, the weakest point is the atrophic muscle. The fact that the stress value was most rapidly normalized suggests that, qualitatively, the regenerated muscle had virtually regained its pretrauma strength by day 56 and that the low values of failure load, strain, and specific energy were mainly due to atrophy of the muscle. Thus, further increase in the tensile strength of the regenerated muscle-tendon unit may require active exercise to reverse muscle atrophy.

TI  - [Cosmetic results of breast conserving therapy for breast carcinoma. Treatment results from the Heidelberg Radiation Clinic in the years 1984 to 1992]  
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study we retrospectively analyzed local control, survival rate and late cosmetic results of women with early breast cancer receiving breast conserving therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients (1984 through 1992) of the Department of Radio-Oncology (University of Heidelberg), who received breast conserving therapy consisting of conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy, were interviewed and asked to come. Subjective estimation of the cosmetic results of therapy was evaluated by means of a questionnaire. Cosmesis, circumferences and temperatures of different mammary regions were assessed and measured. Side effects and late sequelae were valued by the EORTC/RTOG-score. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time of 192 women (pT1: 71.9%, pT2: 28.1%) was 4.5 years (median: 4.0 years). 26.6% of them were nodal positive. Positive nodal status correlated with high tumor grading (p = 0.0001). Ten patients developed distant metastases; one of them subsequent to having suffered a loco-regional failure. Eight loco-regional failures occurred, 3 of them before radiotherapy (salvage).  Following radiotherapy altogether 5 loco-regional failures (= 2.6%) were found; 3 women concerning were pre-, 2 postmenopausal. Three of these patients died, in 1 case occurred distant metastasis. Seventeen patients died, 3 of them presenting loco-regional failure, 8 of them showing distant metastasis. Sixty-four women were examined for cosmesis with the following result: a poor result was observed twice, a fair result 13 times, a good result 34 and an excellent result 15 times. Self-assessment was significantly better than observer's assessment. Third-degree late sequelae were found once, second-degree was seen 11 times, first-degree 38 times and no visible late sequelae were observed 14 times. The use of wedges was followed with borderline significance (p = 0.06) either by a better cosmesis and fewer late sequelae. Neither the type of surgery nor the width of the fields nor the quality of radiation (Co60 or 6 MVX) nor boost-application influenced the cosmetic result. Measured circumferences and distances showed no significant differences in the groups of the patients with poor or fair and good or excellent cosmesis. The temperature of the seized and contralateral breast showed no significant difference as well. With increasing distance from primary therapy the cosmetic results deteriorated. CONCLUSION: Breast conserving therapy consisting of conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy causes predominantly excellent to good cosmetic results combined with an acceptable amount of late side effects. The decreased rate of good and excellent cosmetic long-term results is biological interesting and requires further studies.

TI  - Cocaine use as a risk factor for abdominal pregnancy.  
AB  -  Failure to diagnose abdominal pregnancies can have disastrous morbidity/mortality consequences for mother and fetus. To make the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy requires that the physician have a high index of suspicion and that he or she have a good understanding of the risk factors of abdominal pregnancy. This article presents data suggesting that maternal cocaine use is a risk factor for abdominal pregnancy, reviews the literature on the maternal/fetal effects of maternal cocaine use and the risk factors of abdominal pregnancy, and analyzes 55 cases of abdominal pregnancy. Maternal cocaine use correlated with a 20% rate of increase in the incidence of abdominal pregnancy compared with the 70% rate of decrease in the "before cocaine" time period. Recommendations are offered for management.

TI  - Mitral valve replacement with glutaraldehyde preserved aortic allografts.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present long-term results after mitral valve replacement with stent mounted glutaraldehyde preserved aortic allografts in patients older than 15 years. The clinical support for this study was to combine the glutaraldehyde technique of biological tissue preservation with the advantages of allografts when compared to xenografts. This was demonstrated in previous studies using other methods of tissue processing. METHODS: Between September 1984 and November 1994, 70 patients aged 16-77 years (mean 35.4 years) underwent mitral valve replacement with this preserved and mounted allograft. Of these, 40 patients (57.2%) were aged 16-35 years and 15 (21.4%) were 20 years old or younger; 46 (65.7%) were females and 24 (34.3%) males. Single mitral valve replacement was performed in 60 patients and 10 were also subjected to other combined cardiac procedures. Human aortic valves were obtained during routine autopsy, processed in glutaraldehyde and mounted into flexible stents, using the same technique as that used for porcine bioprostheses. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 1.4%. Total follow-up was 543.1 patient-years, corresponding to a mean follow-up of 7.9 years per patient. Echocardiography demonstrated a hemodynamic performance similar to porcine bioprostheses. Late mortality was 0.7 +/- 0.6% per patient-year and the causes were congestive heart failure in 2, prosthetic endocarditis in 1 and acute myocardial infarction in 1. The 12-year actuarial survival was 92.4 +/- 3.2%. The incidence of late complications was 5.2 +/- 1.2% per patient-year, including congestive heart failure, prosthetic endocarditis, periprosthetic leak, thromboembolic episodes, recurrence of rheumatic disease, coronary artery disease and allograft failure. Complications related to heart disease represented 2.8 +/- 0.6% and allobioprosthesis-related 2.4 +/- 0.5% per patient-year. The 12-year actuarial freedom from primary valve failure was 81.0 +/- 15.0%. The incidence of reoperations was 1.5 +/- 0.8% per patient-year and the main indication was prosthetic endocarditis. Other causes were periprosthetic leak, aortic insufficiency in the native aortic valve and allobioprosthesis dysfunction. Functional results demonstrated a significant improvement in patients clinical condition. CONCLUSION: This 12-year follow-up shows a very low incidence of primary allograft failure for patients older than 15 years undergoing mitral valve replacement, and much superior than our results with porcine bioprosthesis in the same age group. This supports our assumption that this investigational valve represents a new advance in cardiac valve surgery.

TI  - The role of maternal control in the development of sex differences in child self-evaluative factors.  
AB  - The major goal of the present research was to examine the role of parental control in the development of sex differences in 2 pivotal self-evaluative factors in children: taking responsibility for failure and possessing strong standards. Parents were expected to use control with and without autonomy granting in specific domains differentially with girls and boys on a daily basis, and this was expected to foster sex differences in children's self-evaluative factors. Ninety-one mothers of elementary school children completed a daily checklist for 10 to 21 days. The checklist assessed mothers' everyday use of control and autonomy granting in 5 specific domains (helping, monitoring, decision making, praising, and disciplining). Children completed self-report measures assessing their tendency to take responsibility for failure and the strength of their standards. As anticipated, mothers were more likely to employ control without autonomy granting with girls than with boys, but were more likely to employ control with autonomy granting with boys than with girls. Significantly, this pattern of gender socialization partially mediated the tendency of girls to take greater responsibility for failure than boys. Although there were no sex differences in the strength of children's standards, the pattern of gender socialization was associated with the strength of children's standards as well.

TI  - [Success and failure in laparoscopic "gastric banding". A report of 3 years experience (see comments)]  
AB  - During 3 years, the adjustable gastric band (AGSB) was laparoscopically implanted in 224 of 873 patients with morbid obesity. The operation was done by 7 surgeons. Problems arising from the operative technique are: early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, gastric perforation, penetration of the band, port infection, penetration of the port, defect of the band catheter. These can be avoided by care and increasing experience. The late pouch dilatation and the insufficient loss of excess weight arise from the unsatisfactory compliance of the patient. Critical selection of patients is necessary. Total morbidity in this seria was 19%, the letality 0.4% and the average excess weight loss within 2 years was 50 +/- 28%. The results may be improved by restrictive selection of patients and great operative routine.

TI  - Dose escalation with 3D conformal treatment: five year outcomes, treatment optimization, and future directions.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the 5-year outcomes of dose escalation with 3D conformal treatment (3DCRT) of prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred thirty-two consecutive patients were treated with 3DCRT alone between 6/89 and 10/92 with ICRU reporting point dose that increased from 63 to 79 Gy. The median follow-up was 60 months, and any patient free of clinical or biochemical evidence of disease was termed bNED.  Biochemical failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rising on two consecutive recordings and exceeding 1.5 ng/ml. Morbidity was reported by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale, the Late Effects Normal Tissue (LENT) scale, and a Fox Chase modification of the latter (FC-LENT). All patients were treated with a four-field technique with a 1 cm clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin to the prostate or prostate boost; the CTV and gross tumor volume (GTV) were the same. Actuarial rates of outcome were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence methods and compared using the log rank and Gray's test statistic, respectively. Cox regression models were used to establish prognostic factors predictive of the various measures of outcome. Five-year Kaplan-Meier bNED rates were utilized by dose group to estimate logit response models for bNED and late morbidity. RESULTS: PSA <10 ng/ml: No dose response was demonstrated using estimated bNED rates or by analysis of PSA nadir vs. dose. PSA 10-19.9 ng/ml: A bNED dose response was demonstrated (p = 0.02) using the log rank test. The logit response model showed 5-year bNED rates of 35% at 70 Gy and 75% at 76 Gy (p = 0.0049) and illustrated the relative ineffectiveness of conventional dose treatment. PSA 20+ ng/ml: A bNED dose response was demonstrated (p = 0.02) using the log rank test. The logit response model indicated a 5-year bNED rate of 10% at 70 Gy and 32% at 76 Gy (p = 0.10). Morbidity: Dose response was demonstrated for FC-LENT grade 2 and grade 3,4 GI morbidity and for LENT grade 2 GU sequelae. RTOG grade 3,4 GI morbidity at 5 years was <1%. Factors associated with bNED, cause-specific survival, and metastasis were studied using Cox multivariate analysis. Pretreatment PSA (p = 0.0001), Gleason score 7-10 (p = 0.0001), and dose (p = 0.017) were significantly predictive of bNED. For each 1 Gy increase in dose, the hazard of bNED failure decreased by 8%. Palpation stage was associated with cause-specific survival (p = 0.002) and distant metastasis (p = 0.0004). Gleason score was also predictive of distant metastasis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A dose response was observed for patients with pretreatment PSA >10 ng/ml based on 5-year bNED results. No dose response was observed for patients with pretreatment PSA < 10 ng/ml. Dose response was observed for FC-LENT grade 2 and grade 3,4 GI sequelae and for LENT grade 2 GU sequelae. Optimization of treatment was made possible by the results in this report. The improvement in 5-year bNED rates for patients with PSA levels > 10 ng/ml strongly suggests that clinical trials employing radiation should investigate the use of 3DCRT and prostate doses of 76-80 Gy.

TI  - Microscopic and energy dipersive x-ray analysis of surface adaptation of dental cements to dental ceramic surfaces.  
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Clinical failure rates reported for acid etched/resin-bonded ceramic restorations are significantly lower than those reported for restorations luted with traditional cements. This improved clinical performance may be associated with greater adaptation of the resin cements to the ceramic surfaces. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of resin cements accompanied by acid etching results in improved adaptation when compared with the use of zinc phosphate or glass ionomer cements. RESULTS: The results of this experiment indicate that superior adaptation of cement to ceramic is produced by acid etching and luting with resin cement. In addition, the results lead to the hypothesis that the high clinical failure rates reported for zinc phosphate or glass ionomer luted restorations are due either to incomplete adaptation or to failure within the cement. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the use of resin cements accompanied by acid etching of the ceramic surface is the preferred technique for clinical placement of all-ceramic restorations.

TI  - The effect of amalgam bonding on resistance form of Class II amalgam restorations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the load required to produce failure in Class II bonded amalgam restorations. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Five groups of 12 maxillary molars were mounted. Class II mesio-occlusal preparations were cut: group 1, extension through central grooves, without retention grooves; group 2, proximal slot preparation, without retention grooves; groups 3 and 5, slot preparation with long facial and lingual retention grooves; group 4, slot preparation without grooves, with unsupported proximal enamel allowed to remain. Groups 1 to 4 were restored with an amalgam-bonding system and amalgam; in group 5, no amalgam-bonding material was used. RESULTS: Mean (SD) failure loads: group 1, 281 (77) N; group 2, 246 (101) N; group 3, 238 (84) N; group 4, 254 (100) N; and group 5, 191 (66) N. CONCLUSION: Although there was a trend toward greater resistance to dislodgment or fracture when an amalgam-bonding technique was used, its use did not significantly increase the resistance to failure when compared to retention grooves alone.

TI  - Tacrolimus (FK506) and the pharmaceutical/academic/regulatory gauntlet.  
AB  - The pivotal issue of transplant rejection diagnosis and management is design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials. The historical experience with clinical trials of major immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine and especially tacrolimus) is examined in this article. Cyclosporine was a turning point in transplantation, providing an extraordinary improvement over previous therapies. Additionally, early investigational experience with tacrolimus was shown to be important in rescue from cyclosporine failure. Experience with tacrolimus in liver recipients for primary therapy led to understanding that the side effect profile was similar to cyclosporine and that the important side effects of tacrolimus (toxicity and diabetes) could be lessened by altering the drug dose. Early dosing regimens were determined by attempts to balance the toxicities (representing a dose ceiling) against rejection (for minimum dosing). Drug levels became understandable and trough levels could be used to guide therapy. However, when the multicenter liver trial was implemented, high starting doses were included in the protocol design, ignoring information obtained with drug level monitoring. Disregard for this information led to a distortion of the potential value of tacrolimus. Historical controls from the Pittsburgh experience suggested that tacrolimus was a critical immunosuppressant, and the randomized trial against cyclosporine confirmed the drug's ability to compete. The multicenter liver trial, however, was not balanced across treatment arms for other immunosuppressive agents (ie, higher doses of prednisone from center to center, additional induction protocols at various centers). Additionally, analysis of study results differed across continents, and the role of tacrolimus in cyclosporine rescue was not examined thoroughly. When tacrolimus was proposed for use in extrahepatic organ transplantation, again the Pittsburgh experience, as well as experience from other single centers, was determined inadequate evidence of efficacy, and randomized trials were required by the FDA. The fact that multicenter trials in transplantation have historically been poorly designed or analyzed weighed against the dramatic improvements shown from historically controlled studies or single-center trials should lead to question of the regulatory requirement for multicenter randomized trials for all organ types.

AB  - Four case reports of children with nursing caries and failure to thrive are presented. Without regard to the condition of the dentition, the various cases could be classified as organic, mixed, or nonorganic in etiology. After dental rehabilitation, all patients exhibited an acceleration of weight velocity that resulted in weights above the 5th percentile. During the period of observation, the weight velocity continued to increase with time, consistent with the "catch-up" phenomenon of growth that is observed in nutritionally deprived children.

TI  - Salvage radical cystoprostatectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion following radiation failure.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Salvage surgery followed by lower urinary tract reconstruction is a viable therapeutic option for patients in whom definitive radiation therapy for localized bladder or prostate cancer has failed. Improvements in surgical technique and postoperative care have significantly improved overall outcome. An enhanced understanding of the rhabdoid sphincteric mechanism responsible for maintaining urinary continence following cystoprostatectomy has helped make the orthotopic neobladder the procedure of choice for patients requiring lower urinary tract reconstruction. We describe our experience with salvage surgery and orthotopic bladder substitution following failed radical radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the complications of 18 patients in whom definitive radiation therapy (total minimum dose 60 Gy. or greater) for bladder or prostate cancer had failed. All patients underwent a salvage procedure with creation of an orthotopic neobladder. RESULTS: Operative characteristics, postoperative outcomes and postoperative complications related or unrelated to urinary reconstruction were similar between irradiated and nonirradiated patients. Good day and night continence following surgery was reported by 67 and 56% of irradiated patients, respectively. Patients with poor postoperative continence were successfully treated with the placement of an artificial urinary sphincter. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage surgery with orthotopic urinary reconstruction is a safe, effective procedure that provides a functional lower urinary tract in patients in whom definitive pelvic radiation therapy has failed.

TI  - Effectiveness of adhesive systems for a Co-Cr removable partial denture alloy.  
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro bond strengths of traditional denture base acrylic resin (Lucitone 199) to a cobalt-chromium partial denture alloy (J.D. Partial Denture Alloy) were tested using two surface pretreatments (sandblast, sandblast and electrochemical etch) with three adhesive primers: Lee Metal Primer, Acrylic Solder, and CR Inlay cement. A sandblasted group with no primer served as the control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The alloy specimens (8.0-mm bonding diameter) were cast and invested to receive a traditional denture base resin after surface treatments (sandblasted, and sandblasted-electrochemically etched) and application of adhesive primers. The bonded specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and divided into two groups. The first group was debonded in tension on a testing machine at a cross-head speed of 0.05 cm/min. The second group was subjected to thermocycling of 1,000 cycles and then tested for tensile bond strength. The force at which the bond failed was recorded, and the bond strength was calculated in megapascals (MPa). The sites of bond failure were examined, quantified under (20x) magnification, and recorded. Ten specimens were evaluated for each experimental condition for a total of 160 specimens. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with a factorial design. Means were compared by Tukey intervals at the 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: Significant differences in bond strength were observed, with primers being the most important factor, followed by pretreatment and storage and thermocycling with significant interactions. Sandblasted-electrochemically etched alloy with primers more effectively enhanced bond strength of the denture base resin to the treated alloy than sandblasted alloy with primers. Thermocycling had a greater effect on bond strength of the specimens with Acrylic Solder when compared with Lee and CR Inlay primers. The highest bond strengths (> or = 18.0 MPa) were observed for the conditions involving electrochemical etching and the priming with CR Inlay cement (both after 24 hours and thermocycling of 1,000 cycles). For primed specimens, the bond failures occurred cohesively within the primers or the denture resin and adhesively between the primers and the denture base resin, or between primers and alloy. For nonprimed, the bond failures occurred adhesively at the denture base resin-metal interface. CONCLUSIONS: Nonprimed specimens (both sandblasted and electrochemically etched) had lowest bond strength (0.4 +/- 0.1 MPa; 0.3 +/- 0.4 MPa). The bond strengths of the primed treated specimens were improved significantly. The CR Inlay-treated specimens exhibited the highest bond strength (20.6 +/- 6.3 MPa). After thermocycling for 1,000 cycles, the bond strengths of the specimens were significantly lower than the bond strengths of the specimens after 24 hours.

TI  - Predictors of early failure of fixation in the treatment of displaced subcapital hip fractures.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine predictors of fixation failure in the treatment of displaced subcapital hip fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: All patients aged sixty-five years and older discharged from a large teaching hospital after treatment for displaced subcapital fracture between April 1, 1989 and February 29, 1995 were identified (n = 344). Of these, 108 patients treated with internal fixation became the study group. Clinical information included demographics, implant, comorbidity, complications, mortality, surgeon' s assessment of reduction, and need for revision. Preoperative x-ray information: Garden grade, Singh Index, Pauwel's angle, medial neck and femoral shaft cortex width, and displacement of fracture fragments. Postoperative: Quality of reduction, a visible gap or step, evidence of union, fracture collapse, and failure. RESULTS: The failure rate was 31 percent. The two most important predictors were varus reduction and perceived difficulty in achieving reduction. If the patient had a varus reduction or the surgeon had difficulty achieving a satisfactory reduction, fixation was 4.3 times more likely to fail (p = 0.007). If the patient had a varus reduction and reduction was difficult, fixation was 13.6 times more likely to fail (p = 0.04). Under this latter scenario, 75 percent of the fixations failed. CONCLUSION: In a fracture of the neck of the femur, if difficulty is encountered in obtaining a closed reduction or there is residual varus angulation, the chance of subsequent fixation failure is high. Hemiarthroplasty may be considered in these cases.

TI  -  Failure of thrombolytic therapy in patients with myocardial infarction is associated with high plasma levels of factor VII antigen.  
AB  - Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction fails to re-establish coronary blood flow in a significant number of patients. One reason for this may be haemostatic imbalance. We investigated whether coagulation factor VII antigen (FVIIag), fibrinogen and protein C were related to reperfusion. Plasma from 45 patients was drawn before treatment and reperfusion assessed by means of continuous, on-line, vector-ECG analysis. Among the 17 patients with no reperfusion, FVIIag levels were significantly higher than among the 28 with signs of reperfusion (560 vs. 410 microg/l median, p = 0.006). Protein C levels where higher in the group with successful reperfusion (1.10 vs. 1.01 U/ml median, p = 0.03), whereas no difference was seen in fibrinogen levels. The findings were not influenced by plasma-triglycerides, body-mass index, age or time between onset of chest pain and thrombolytic therapy. The results suggest that FVII is of importance for the formation as well as resolution of coronary clots.

TI  - Resin bond strength with different methods to remove excess water from the dentin.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the resin bond strength using different methods to remove the excess water from the dentin while maintaining it moist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 human molars were randomly divided into four treatment groups of 15 teeth each as follows: Group 1: A wet bonding technique was used as recommended by the manufacturer and was used as a control group. The exposed occlusal dentin surfaces were conditioned with 32% phosphoric acid (Uni-Etch) for 15 seconds and rinsed for 15 seconds. 40 microL of distilled water was added to standardize the content of the water on dentin surface. The conditioned dentin surfaces were gently blow-dried for 3 seconds with oil-free compressed air. The tip of the syringe was placed at 2 cm from the dentin surface. One coat of the One-Step primer/adhesive was applied to the dentin surface using a fully saturated brush tip, allowed to remain on the surface undisturbed for 3 seconds, and then gently air-dried for 3 seconds from a distance of 1 cm to remove excess solvent and water. A second coat of the primer/adhesive was applied and gently air-dried from a distance of 1 cm. The primer/adhesive was light-cured for 10 seconds. Resin composite (Z100, shade A3) was then polymerized for 40 seconds. Group 2: The dentin surface was blot-dried by applying tissue paper (Kimwipes EX-L) adjacent to the exposed area; Group 3: The excess water on the dentin surface was removed using an applicator brush (Bend-a-Brush) for 5 seconds; Group 4: A small dry hydrophilic cotton pellet was gently applied over the dentin surface to remove the excess water. The sequential steps for these three groups were similar to those of Group 1. The dentin surface remained visibly moist in all procedures. After light-curing, the specimens were thermocycled (5 degrees and 55 degrees C, 500 cycles, 30-second dwell time). The specimens were sheared and the data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test methods. The site of failure was analyzed using a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05). Turkey's test revealed that Group 1 was significantly lower than Groups 2, 3 and 4 with no difference between the last three groups (P < 0.05). All samples showed resin cohesive failures.

TI  - Neurocentral synchondrosis fracture in immature spines associated with pedicle screw type fixation devices.  
AB  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the weak point in immature lumbar vertebrae associated with pedicle screw instrumentation. Ten immature thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were collected from calf spines. After installation of 6- and 7-mm-diameter pedicle screws into the pedicles of each specimen, pullout force was applied to the screw using the uniaxial MTS system until failure. Tightening torque during installation was measured. From the load-displacement curve, failure load was calculated and failure site was confirmed by radiographs. Inner pedicle diameters were measured after the pullout test, and percent fills of the pedicle screw were calculated. Mean tightening torque was 1.4 or 2.1 (Nm), mean failure load was 852.5 or 1,015.0 (N), and mean percent fill was 81.4 or 93.5% for 6- or 7-mm screws, respectively. Tightening torque and percent fill in 7-mm screws were significantly (p < 0.01) greater than that in 6-mm screws; however, failure load showed no significant difference (p = 0.10) between the two screw groups. Failure by screw pullout occurred at the screw-bone interface or through the neurocentral synchondrosis (NS). NS fractures were observed in 20% of 6-mm screws, 60% of 7-mm screws, and 40% overall, whereas interface failures occurred in 80% of 6-mm screws, 40% of 7-mm screws, and 60% overall. In NS fracture group, tightening torque (p < 0.05) and percent fill (p < 0.01) were significantly greater than in the interface failure group. The results led us to conclude that the mechanism of the NS fracture is unclear. However, NS fracture could be one of the conceivable complications associated with pedicle screw fixation in the immature spine.

TI  - Cribriform carcinoma of the prostate and cribriform prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: incidence and clinical implications.  
AB  - Cribriform neoplasia of the prostate can be recognized easily. However, controversy persists regarding terminology, particularly with the intraductal spread of cribriform neoplasia; some consider this "intraductal carcinoma," whereas consensus meetings defined these lesions as high-grade cribriform prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGCP). This study attempts to identify the incidence and clinical significance of HGCP and cribriform carcinoma (CC) by evaluating 114 radical prostatectomy specimens. Cases were divided into three histologic groups for statistical analysis: (1) pure acinar carcinoma: infiltrating acinar carcinoma without evidence of cribriform neoplasia; (2) CC: acinar carcinoma with CC; and (3) HGCP: acinar carcinoma with HGCP. High-grade cribriform prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was defined as the presence of neoplastic cells spanning the entire lumen in a cribriform configuration in which a basal cell layer could be shown by immunohistochemistry. Similar areas in which no basal cell layer could be seen were diagnosed as CC. The incidence of cribriform neoplasia was 38% (43 of 114). The incidences of HGCP and CC were 13% (15 of 114) and 25% (28 of 114), respectively. Univariate analysis showed a strong association between HGCP and CC both and several preoperative and final pathology results, including digital rectal examination, pathology tumor stage, extraprostatic extension, surgical margin positivity, high Gleason sum (GS), and high tumor volume. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed HGCP to have a 61% cumulative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure rate in contrast with CC and pure acinar cancer, which had cumulative PSA failure rates of 15% and 13%, respectively (p = 0.0001, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox's proportional-hazards analysis found preoperative serum PSA, GS, tumor stage, and volume to be important predictors of PSA failure. In a second regression model that included serum PSA, GS, and pathology tumor stage, HGCP was an independent predictor of PSA failure. Both HGCP and CC are closely associated with several poor prognostic indicators, including advanced pathology tumor stage, a high GS, and serum PSA. Multivariate analysis showed HGCP as an independent prognostic indicator. The close association between high tumor volume and HGCP supports the theory that the development of HGCP is a late event in tumor progression, more compatible with the intraductal spread of tumor than dysplasia.

TI  - Noninvasive assessment of stiffness and failure load of human vertebrae from CT-data.  
AB  - A calculational method based on noninvasively derived data for the assessment of the mechanical quality of individual vertebrae is presented. Dimensional data obtained from serial, segmented CT scans were used as the geometric input for a newly developed finite element model designed to calculate stiffness and failure load of these complex bone structures. Mechanical, structural data for cancellous bone was obtained by measurements of the compressive strength and failure load of actual vertebral specimens obtained at autopsy. The stiffness and failure load calculated by the newly developed finite element model were compared with the data obtained from mechanical measurements of vertebral specimens. A high correlation between measured and calculated failure load was found (r = 0.89, p < 0.001, n = 16). The correlation between the failure load and bone mineral density (BMD) was significant (r = 0.82, p < 0.001, n = 16). A similar correlation between calculated and measured stiffness (r = 0.81, p < 0.001, n = 15) was also found using the finite element model described herein. Thus the newly developed calculation methodology has been verified and can be used to predict the failure load and stiffness of osteoporotic vertebrae using data obtained non-invasively from CT scans.

TI  - [Long-term results of tibial head osteotomy]  
AB  - QUESTION: Long term outcome after high tibial osteotomies is essential too for the actual indication of these procedures. Complications and success rate were analysed in our patients in order to find out predictive determinants for the outcome. METHOD: 200 high tibial osteotomies were performed at the Orthopaedic clinic of Kiel University between 1974 and 1983. 148 knees (74%) could be reviewed with an average follow-up period of 10 years. 103 knees were personally examined, 45 cases were investigated by questionnaire. RESULTS: 74% were content with the result of the operation. Deterioration of complaints could be stopped in many cases, although the radiographic changes were not parallel to subjective relief of pain. The survival rate without implantation of knee prostheses was 96% 12 years postoperatively. In 10 cases which had continuous complaints knee arthroplasties were performed one to two years after high tibial osteotomy. 6 knees required additional surgery because of loss of correction. Serious complications did not occur apart from one peroneal nerve palsy and two deep though completely healed infections. CONCLUSION: High tibial osteotomy in a modified procedure according to Coventry thus guarantees long term success with low risk of failure only.

TI  - Mitochondrial permeability transition as induced by cross-linking of the adenine nucleotide translocase.  
AB  - Mitochondrial permeability transition is caused by the opening of a transmembrane pore whose chemical nature has not been well established yet. The present work was aimed to further contribute to the knowledge of the membrane entity comprised in the formation of the non-specific channel. The increased permeability was established by analyzing the inability of rat kidney mitochondria to take up and accumulate Ca2+, as well as their failure to build up a transmembrane potential, after the cross-linking of membrane proteins by copper plus ortho-phenanthroline. To identify the cross-linked proteins, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. The results are representative of at least three separate experiments. It is indicated that 30 microM Cu2+ induced the release of 4.3 nmol Ca2+ per mg protein. However, in the presence of 100 microM ortho-phenanthroline only 2 microM Cu2+ was required to attain the total release of the accumulated Ca2+; it should be noted that such a reaction is not inhibited by cyclosporin. The increased permeability corresponds to cross-linking of membrane proteins in which approximately 4 nmol thiol groups per mg protein appear to be involved. Such a linking process is inhibited by carboxyatractyloside. By using the fluorescent probe eosin-5-maleimide the label was found in a cross-linking 60 kDa dimer of two 30 kDa monomers. From the data presented it is concluded that copper-o-phenanthroline induces the intermolecular cross-linking of the adenine nucleotide translocase which in turn is converted to non-specific pore.

TI  - Intracoronary stenting and risk for major adverse cardiac events during the first month.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our rationale for this study was to analyze the risk for procedural failure of attempted stenting and the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after success and to develop a risk stratification protocol for successful procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stenting was attempted in 2894 procedures during the 5-year study period (success in 98.3% of 3815 lesions). After failure, the MACE rate was 42.6%. The risk for failure was higher for lesions in the left circumflex coronary artery or in venous bypass grafts and after an acute occlusion before stenting; it increased with stenosis length or grade and decreased with vessel size and growing institutional experience in stenting. After success, death occurred in 0.8%, death or myocardial infarction in 2.0%, and any MACE in 3.6%. Independent risk factors for MACE were older age, diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, impaired left ventricular function, residual dissections, stent overlap, longer stented segments, and a postprocedural regimen without ticlopidine. Procedural factors were substantially stronger predictors than operator-independent variables available before procedures. Overall, the risk declined after the first 3 days. Two major factors exhibited time-dependent variations of their influence: while residual dissections were the dominant risk factor within the first 3 days with a reduction after that, no protective effect of ticlopidine could be identified before day 3. From these results, we derived a risk stratification protocol for individual procedures. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the importance of optimal angiographic results and the need for antiplatelet regimens with immediate onset. Our risk stratification protocol may guide individual postprocedural care and allow us to compare risk profiles of different study populations and to devise quality control programs for stenting.

TI  - Palliative care of cancer patients: audit of current hospital procedures.  
AB  - The palliative care of cancer patients admitted for tumour-related symptoms to three different departments (medical oncology, radiotherapy, internal medicine) of a general hospital was prospectively audited. The physicians directly responsible for the patients provided prospective data by reporting both the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions performed and the degree of control achieved for each symptom. A patient form for evaluation of the control achieved in the case of each symptom by means of linear analogue scales was also provided. The appropriateness of all procedures was evaluated by two external auditors. Over 6 months, 125 such admissions were recorded: 24 patients entered the study and the management of 56 symptoms, the most common of which were pain and dyspnoea, was reviewed. A total of 72 diagnostic procedures were performed, deemed necessary for only 50% of symptoms, optional for 15%, and performed as part of a logical sequence for 38%. A total of 130 therapeutic interventions were undertaken, deemed necessary for 55% of symptoms, optional for 15% and carried out as part of a logical sequence for 44%. Re-evaluations of symptoms and physician and patient evaluations of the degree of control achieved could not be assessed because of lack of information. The audit could not be repeated owing to the low accrual of patients and incompleteness of the data collection. Reasons for failure of the study and proposals for feasible methods of auditing the management of symptoms in cancer patients are discussed.

TI  - Degree of hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis is related to organ failure and prognosis after burn trauma.  
AB  - Severely burned patients often present a hypercoagulability situation. However, its magnitude, time course, and relationship with organ failure and outcome remains to be established. Forty-three patients were studied on the first and seventh day after burn for hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis parameters. A hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis state was found the first day after burn demonstrated by high levels of activated factor VII (VIIa, p<0.01), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT, p<0.01), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, p<0.001) and D dimer (DD, p<0.01) and low levels of antithrombin III (ATIII, p<0.01), protein C (PC, p<0.01), plasminogen (PG, p<0.001) and alpha2 antiplasmin (AP, p<0.001). A paradoxical coexisting hypofibrinolysis was found as suggested by a low global fibrinolytic activity in the euglobulin plasma fraction fibrin plate assay (FA, p<0.01) and high levels of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1, p<0.01). On day 7, a less marked hypercoagulability situation was found, with low ATIII (p<0.01) and PC (p<0.01), persisting the hypofibrinolytic situation observed on the first day. Non-survivors (NS) showed higher levels of VIIa (p<0.01), TAT (p<0.05) and t-PA (p<0.05), and lower levels of ATIII (p<0.05), PC (p<0.05) and AP (p<0.001) than survivors (S) on the first day. Also, there was a positive correlation of Marshall organ failure score with ATIII, (r2=0.49, p<0.001), PC, (r2=0.14, p<0.045) and PG levels, (r2=0.41, p<0.0003). Severely burned patients show a state of transient disseminated intravascular coagulation, related to the development of organ failure and outcome.

TI  - Outcome of small-for-gestational age and appropriate-for-gestational age infants born before 27 weeks of gestation.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the consequences of being small-for-gestational age at extremely low gestational age. METHODOLOGY: Comparison of two historical cohorts of small-for-gestational age (SGA) and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) infants born between 24 and 26 6/7 weeks of gestation (gestational age estimated by early ultrasound at 16 to 18 weeks). Data were collected retrospectively on 191 successive admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1992. These included: demographic and maternal information, delivery mode and condition at birth, mortality, neonatal intensive care unit morbidities (respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosis [PDA], chronic lung disease [CLD], retinopathy of prematurity [ROP], necrotizing enterocolitis, infection), nutrition, and length of hospitalization. RESULTS: Forty-one (21%) of the 191 infants were classified as SGA. Those with congenital anomalies (10% in the SGA and 2% in the AGA group) were excluded from further analysis. Despite a similar rate of respiratory distress syndrome (50%), the SGA infants had a greater rate of failure of indomethacin treatment for PDA closure (54% vs 32% for AGA), a higher risk for CLD defined as a need for supplementary oxygen at 36 weeks (65% vs 32% for AGA), a more prolonged need for oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support (94 days vs 68 days for AGA and 58 days vs 40 days for AGA, respectively). SGA infants were also at greater risk for developing severe ROP (stage >/=III) (65% vs 12% for AGA). CONCLUSIONS: For infants born before 27 weeks, being small-for-gestational age confers additional risks for severe morbidity, ie, PDA ligation, CLD, and ROP.

TI  - Outcome of patients with an implanted artificial anal sphincter for severe faecal incontinence. A single institution report.  
AB  - Implantation of an artificial sphincter is an alternative treatment for patients with severe faecal incontinence. This prospective study from one institution has evaluated the results from 13. Preoperative and postoperative incontinence scores, anal manometry, and quality of life were evaluated in 13 patients who had undergone implantation of an artificial sphincter over a 7-year period. Two patients were definitive failures. One developed acute total colitis after 5 years of satisfactory function, and a second had discomfort and demanded removal of an otherwise functioning device. After a median follow-up of 30 (range 5-76) months, 11 patients had an activated and functional device. These included 6 with a urinary AMS 800 and 5 with the newly designed anal ABS. The mean incontinence score decreased from 17 to 4, and quality of life improved markedly. Two of the 11 patients had undergone successful reimplantation, one following rupture of the cuff and the second following ulceration of the control pump through the labia. In no case was infection or erosion of the anal canal a cause of failure. While the cause of incontinence and age did not affect outcome, psychological reaction had a significant impact. The artificial anal sphincter may have a role to play in severe faecal incontinence.

TI  - Perinatal substance abuse: the impact of reporting infants to child protective services.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to follow the judicial placement of newborns with positive toxicology screening results and to determine how long such infants remained in foster care, separated from their mothers or other relatives, and the length of court dependency. We also determined the mothers' compliance with court orders, the availability and use of rehabilitative services, factors used by the court to determine the final disposition, and the eventual placement of the infants. METHODS: The cohort sample consisted of all infants from San Mateo County (CA) born at Stanford University Hospital during a 2-year period whose urine tests in the well-baby nursery were positive for illicit substances. Fifty-three newborns were identified, and their medical records and court documents were matched and reviewed from birth until termination of judicial review (or 5 years). Data were summarized and analyzed by logistic regressions to identify predictors of specific outcomes. RESULTS: All 53 infants had normal physical examinations and uneventful hospital courses. Their ethnic distribution, with 68% being African-American and 7% being Hispanic, differed from the rest of the nursery population, which was predominantly Hispanic. Twenty-six (46%) of the 53 infants were returned to their mothers within 1 week of birth; 39 (76%) of the infants were reunited with some relative within the first month of life. At 12 months of age, 10 infants (19%) remained in foster care; however, none remained in foster care beyond 18 months. The length of time infants were dependents of the court ranged from 1 month to >5 years; 70% of the cases were "closed" between 6 and 30 months of life. Nine (17%) were dependents of the court for >36 months. Final placement of the infants was 35 (66%) reunited with at least one parent, 9 (17%) in long-term guardianship relationships with other relatives, and 9 (17%) adopted. All of the mothers were ordered to complete a drug rehabilitation program; 24 mothers (44%) fully complied and had repeatedly drug-free urine tests; 2 others (4%) had drug-free urine tests after incomplete participation in drug rehabilitation. Twenty-two (42%) of the mothers never complied with drug rehabilitation. Subsequent drug use was evident in less than half of the mothers during the period of study. Only one mother was reported for child abuse. Characteristics that most strongly predicted failure in family reunification were a history of failed drug rehabilitation, previous involvement of Child Protective Services, or previous removal of a child because of substance abuse. CONCLUSION: Identifying and reporting newborns exposed to maternal substance abuse during pregnancy can be associated with beneficial changes in the environment of the infants and successful rehabilitation of many mothers. The use of judicial supervision, rehabilitative and supportive services, and long-term involvement of social services without criminal prosecution are key to successful outcome. This study supports the policy and recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics and should lessen health professionals' concerns about negative effects of reporting these patients to Child Protective Services.

TI  - A prospective study of microvascular free-flap surgery and outcome.  
AB  - Over a 6-month period, 23 members of the International Microvascular Research Group participated in a prospective survey of their microvascular free-flap practice. Data were recorded with each case for 60 variables covering patient characteristics, surgical technique, pharmacologic treatment, and postoperative outcome. A total of 493 free flaps were reported with a representative demographic distribution for age, sex, indications for surgery, risk factors, flap type, surgical technique, and pharmacologic intervention. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to determine predictors of flap failure and associated complications. The overall incidence of flap failure was 4.1 percent (20 of 493). Reconstruction of an irradiated recipient site and the use of a skin-grafted muscle flap were the only statistically significant predictors of flap failure, with increased odds of failure of 4.2 (p = 0.01) and 11.1 (p = 0.03), respectively. A postoperative thrombosis requiring re-exploration surgery occurred in 9.9 percent of the flaps. The incidence of this complication was significantly higher when the flap was transferred to a chronic wound and when vein grafts were needed, with increased odds of failure of 2.9 (p = 0.02) and 2.5 (p = 0.02), respectively. There was a lower incidence of postoperative thrombosis when rectus/transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flaps were used, where odds of failure decreased by 0.36 (p = 0.04), and when subcutaneous heparin was administered in the postoperative period, where odds decreased by 0.27 (p = 0.04). There was an overall 69-percent salvage rate for flaps identified with a postoperative thrombosis. Intraoperative thrombosis occurred in 41 cases (8.3 percent) and was observed more frequently in myocutaneous flaps or when vein grafts were needed (5.5 and 5.0 greater odds, respectively; p < 0.001) but was not associated with higher flap failure (2 of 41 cases; 4.9-percent failure rate). The incidence of a hematoma and/or hemorrhage was increased in obese patients and when vein grafts were needed [2.7 (p = 0.02) and 2.6 (p = 0.03) greater odds, respectively], whereas this complication was significantly decreased in muscle flaps (myocutaneous or skin-grafted muscle), in tobacco users, when a heparinized solution was used for general wound irrigation, and when the attending surgeon performed the arterial anastomosis (in contrast to the resident or fellow on staff) (p < 0.05 for each factor). With the multivariable analysis, many factors were found not to have a significant effect on flap outcome, including the recipient site (e.g., head/neck, breast, lower limb, etc.); indications for surgery (trauma, cancer, etc.); flap transfer in extremes of age, smokers, or diabetics; arterial anastomosis with an end-to-end versus end-to-side technique; irrigation of the vessel without or with heparin added to the irrigation solution; and a wide spectrum of antithrombotic drug therapies. These results present a current baseline for free-flap surgery to which future advances and improvements in technique and practice may be compared.

TI  - A rational basis for the use of combined heparin/aspirin and IVIG immunotherapy in the treatment of recurrent IVF failure associated with antiphospholipid antibodies.  
AB  - PROBLEMS: 1) Does the administration of heparin and aspirin (H/A) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) implantation and birth rates in patients with recurrent IVF failure? 2) Is the effect of such treatment related to the antiphospholipid antibody (APA) status of the patients concerned? METHOD OF STUDY: Subjects consisted of 89 women younger than 36 years of age whose infertility was a result of causes other than male infertility and who had experienced four or more failed IVF/embryo transfer procedures. Fifty-two women were APA+ (group A), and 37 were APA- (group B). All patients, regardless of their APA status, received H/A (5000 U sq bid), aspirin (81 mg po qd) from the inception of menotropin therapy along with IVIG (20 g) through a single infusion 3 to 10 days before egg retrieval. RESULTS: Twenty-two (42%) of group A and 7 (19%) of group B patients achieved live births (P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: IVF outcome is significantly improved when H/A and IVIG are administered to APA+ women with repeat IVF failures. APA- women do not seem to benefit from such treatment.

TI  - Petrous bone cholesteatoma and facial paralysis.  
AB  - This paper describes a series of patients with a petrous temporal bone cholesteatoma paying particular attention to the complications and their management. Sixteen patients who underwent surgery in our department were reviewed. Topographically, the petrous bone cholesteatomas were grouped into five categories according to the classification proposed by Sanna et al. There were five massive labyrinthine; five infralabyrinthine; one apical; four supralabyrinthine; and one infralabyrinthine-apical. Clinically, the presenting symptom of these lesions were facial nerve paralysis (10 patients) and unilateral deafness (13 patients). Total removal of the cholesteatomas was achieved in all patients using different surgical approaches according to their site and extent. Recurrences were observed in two patients after 8 months and 24 months, respectively. The facial nerve was infiltrated and compressed by the cholesteatoma in eight patients. Seven were managed with cable grafts using sural nerve. One of these patients was treated using a facial-hypoglossal anastomosis because of the failure of the graft. In the remaining patient, a baby-sitter procedure was employed. In the other two patients, the preoperative facial paralysis was due to compression by the cholesteatoma, and its removal allowed partial recovery of facial function. The rationale of the surgical management of petrous bone cholesteatoma is its radical and total removal. Our present policy is to prefer approaches which result in a closed cavity obliterating the eustachian tube and closing the auditory canal as a blind sac. Facial nerve function is the main complication of these lesions, Facial nerve involvement requires rapid management because the duration of the paralysis is directly related to poor recovery of facial function.

TI  - Genetically determined failure of activation-induced apoptosis of autoreactive T cells as a cause of multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - I postulate that multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that involves genetically determined failure of activation-induced apoptosis of autoreactive T cells in the central nervous system. Activation of central-nervous-system-reactive T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs by exposure to crossreacting antigens or superantigens derived from common infectious agents may trigger attacks of multiple sclerosis. In normal individuals these activated T cells are deleted by activation-induced apoptosis, but in individuals predisposed to multiple sclerosis they survive, proliferate, and damage the central nervous system. The clinical course of multiple sclerosis may vary according to the antigens in the central nervous system being targeted: targeting of myelin antigens leads to a relapsing-remitting course of clinical recovery due to remyelination or other mechanisms; targeting of axonal antigens leads to a progressive course from onset because axonal regeneration is limited in the central nervous system. This hypothesis can account for many characteristics of multiple sclerosis and has predictions that can be tested.

TI  - Mid-term results of the Ross procedure.  
AB  - METHODS: Fifty patients underwent a Ross operation between June 1991 and October 1996. Preoperative diagnosis was: congenital aortic valve disease (31 patients), complex left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (11 patients), outgrowth of a small aortic valve prosthesis (five patients) and valve endocarditis (three patients). Half of the interventions were reoperations. All operations were root replacements. A pulmonary homograft was used in 45 patients. An aorticoventriculoplasty was combined with the root replacement in the 16 patients with LVOT obstruction and a too small aortic valve prosthesis. An enlargement or reduction plasty of the ascending aorta was necessary in seven patients. RESULTS: The mean age was 20.9 years (range: 2.5-54 years). The mean follow up was 34.2 +/- 21 months and was 94% complete. Two patients died after 8 days (low cardiac output due to myocardial fibrosis) and 17.4 months (sudden death), respectively, resulting in a survival of 95 +/- 4% at 4 years. Those two deaths occurred in the group of patients undergoing Ross procedure and aorticoventriculoplasty. Two autografts were replaced after respectively 2 days (technical failure) and 44 months (progressive root dilatation) resulting in a reoperation-free incidence of 93 +/- 6% at 4 years. Other postoperative major complications occurred in six patients. All survivors had regular echo-Doppler examination. All autografts except one had a systolic gradient below 10 mmHg at the last examination. Thirty-four autografts had no leak, ten showed grade 1-2 regurgitation. Two patients showed a higher than grade 3 regurgitation: one leak remains stable with normal left ventricular dimensions and function, one autograft was replaced by a mechanical valve. CONCLUSION: This experience demonstrates that the medium-term results of the Ross procedure are excellent even in complex LVOT obstructions.

TI  - Immunogenicity of hepatitis B Vaccines. Implications for persons at occupational risk of hepatitis B virus infection [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors for decreased immunogenicity among adults vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine and to determine the importance of differences in immunogenicity between vaccines among health care workers (HCWs). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial and decision analysis. PARTICIPANTS: HCSw. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of seroprotective levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and the number of expected chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections associated with lack of protection. RESULTS: Overall, 88% of HCWs developed seroprotection. Risk factors associated with failure to develop seroprotection included increasing age, obesity, smoking and male gender (P < .05). Presence of a chronic disease was associated with lack of seroprotection only among persons > or = 40 years of age (P < .05). The two vaccines studied differed in their overall seroprotection rates (90% vs. 86%; P < .05), however, this difference was restricted to persons > or = 40 years of age (87% vs. 81%; P < .01). Among HCWs > or = 40 years of age, the decision analysis found 44 (0.34/100,000 person-years) excess chronic HBV infections over the working life of the cohort associated with use of the less immunogenic vaccine compared to the other. CONCLUSIONS: He patitis B vaccines are highly immunogenic, but have decreased immunogenicity associated with increasing age, obesity, smoking, and male gender; and among older adults, the presence of a chronic disease. One of the two available vaccines is more immunogenic among older adults; however, this finding has little clinical or public health importance. Hepatitis B vaccines should be administered to persons at occupational risk for HBV infection early in their career, preferably while they are still in their training.

TI  - Regeneration of dorsal column axons after spinal cord injury in young rats.  
AB  - In contrast to previous reports denying the occurrence of axonal regeneration of the dorsal column (DC) projections, here we demonstrate for the first time that marked regeneration occurs spontaneously after transection in infant rats. Transection was made sharply so as to produce edema-free lesions without subsequent formation of either scars or cysts. Transganglionic labeling of axons revealed that regenerated axons ascended in the normal tract in a manner similar to normal projections as a tightly-packed fasciculus and terminated densely in the nucleus gracilis. The present study indicates that failure of regeneration of DC axons is due to neither intrinsic deficiency of regrowth potential nor globally-inhospitable axonal environment but rather the local conditions of the lesion site.

TI  - Faculty development: a field of dreams.  
AB  - This chapter describes the faculty development efforts of the eight schools that participated in The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's "Preparing Physicians for the Future: Program in Medical Education." The authors define "faculty development" as the "enhancement of educational knowledge and skill of faculty members so that their educational contributions can extend to advancing the educational program rather than just teaching within it." Faculty development programs varied widely among the schools. Some schools had active programs in place, others initiated programs at the start of the project. This chapter explores the faculty development topics and methods, both shared and unique, among the eight schools. It then looks at the ways the schools motivated their faculties to participate in their programs. Finally, it describes some of the outcome measures that were used to gauge the effectiveness of the faculty development programs. The authors conclude that the eight schools' approaches and levels of commitment to their faculty development programs varied. They present lessons learned from the successes and failures of the various programs.

TI  - Peritoneal lavage cytology in gastric cancer: an independent predictor of outcome.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and significance of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity of clinically M0 gastric cancer patients is unknown. We reviewed our results with peritoneal washings to determine (1) the prevalence of positive cytology in M0 and M1 disease and (2) the influence of positive cytology on the pattern of failure and survival. METHODS: Laparoscopic washings were obtained from 127 patients with gastric cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from December 1, 1990 to August 1, 1996. Cytology was performed by the Papanicolau technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive cytology was as follows: 0% (0/45) in T1/T2 M0 disease; 10% (3/31) in T3/T4 M0 disease; and 59% in M1 disease. The three M0 patients with positive cytology recurred intra-abdominally (median follow up of 8.5 months). Survival was significantly less compared with stage-matched controls with negative cytology resected for cure (P <.03), and the same as those patients with stage IV disease. CONCLUSION: Patients with positive lavage cytology are stage IV, even in the absence of macroscopic peritoneal disease. Laparoscopic lavage cytology is a rapid technique for identifying the subset of M0 patients who are unlikely to benefit from resection alone. Such patients require additional treatment strategies to improve survival.

TI  - Detection and identification of previously unrecognized microbial pathogens.  
AB  - Features of a number of important but poorly explained human clinical syndromes strongly indicate a microbial etiology. In these syndromes, the failure of cultivation-dependent microbial detection methods reveals our ignorance of microbial growth requirements. Sequence-based molecular methods, however, offer alternative approaches for microbial identification directly from host specimens found in the setting of unexplained acute illnesses, chronic inflammatory disease, and from anatomic sites that contain commensal microflora. The rapid expansion of genome sequence databases and advances in biotechnology present opportunities and challenges: identification of consensus sequences from which reliable, specific phylogenetic information can be inferred for all taxonomic groups of pathogens, broad-range pathogen identification on the basis of virulence-associated gene families, and use of host gene expression response profiles as specific signatures of microbial infection.

TI  - A ported, proximally-cemented femoral stem for total hip arthroplasty. Development and clinical application.  
AB  - We describe the development and early clinical application of a ported, proximally-cemented titanium stem for cemented total hip arthroplasty. PMMA bone cement is delivered to the proximal femur under pressure after the stem has been positioned within the femoral canal. A mid-stem cement occluder contains the cement to the proximal stem only. A tapered body is incorporated in the design of the stem to reduce the structural stiffness and hence the degree of stress shielding within the reconstructed joint. We performed preclinical studies to measure the reduction in porosity and the pressurisation achieved. The porosity, as measured by the void percentage within the cured cement mantle, was reduced by more than 50% and there was an almost threefold increase in the mean pressure. Mechanical testing of the stem, using a three-point bend test, showed that the addition of cement injection ports on the anterior and posterior sides of the body of the proximal stem did not reduce its strength. Finite-element analysis indicated that, compared with a fully-cemented conventional stem, there was no change in the stresses within the cement mantle. In a series of 40 proximally-cemented stems followed for up to six years (mean 51 months) the mean Harris hip score was 91, and 85% of patients had good or excellent results. There was excellent pain relief, an increased level of activity and good patient satisfaction.  One mechanical failure of the stem required revision at three years after implantation. The early results indicate that the clinical performance was equal to that achieved with other modern cemented stems. Radiological evaluation showed excellent results with no evidence of stress shielding. Further follow-up will determine if long-term stress shielding is reduced and if revision is made easier by the absence of a distal cement mantle.

TI  - Dynamic graciloplasty for severe anal incontinence [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical options for the treatment of anal incontinence where standard procedures have failed include transposition of striated muscles, primarily gracilis and gluteus maximus, and implantation of artificial sphincters. Due to a high proportion of fatigue-prone fibres in striated muscles, the results of transposition without stimulation have been disappointing. This study presents the results of stimulated graciloplasty in 13 patients with severe anal incontinence in whom other surgical procedures had failed. METHODS: The gracilis muscle was transposed around the anal canal according to a previously described technique. Eight weeks later the intramuscular electrodes were implanted into the gracilis at the site of the nerve entry and a neurostimulator was placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the abdominal wall. The patients were followed from 7 to 27 months. RESULTS: Six patients obtained satisfactory continence and five showed marked improvement. Two patients were considered failures. Rectal evacuation problems occurred in three patients, in one so severe that the patient, in spite of satisfactory continence, considered the treatment a failure.

Lastly, failure of the imprinting process itself, 'loss of imprinting', may quantitatively alter expression levels of normally imprinted transforming or tumor-suppressing genes, thereby increasing risk for developmental tumors such as Wilms' tumor or choriocarcinoma.

TI  - Role of imprinting in abnormal human development.  
AB  - Parental-specific differences in the expression of certain genes (imprinting), may be implicated in the pathogenesis of anomalous gestations, but only a minority manifest themselves as malformation syndromes. Delayed or lost gestations are much more frequent sequelae, as are those disorganized to such an extent that they are usually classified as neoplastic rather than developmental processes. Expression levels from imprinted loci are dependent not only on the number of genomic alleles present and their structural integrity, but also on their specific parental origin. Anomalous expression of imprinted genes during development is sometimes caused by imbalanced representation of maternal and paternal contributions, 'uniparental disomy'. Uniparental parthenogenetic or androgenetic gestations form ovarian teratomas or complete hydatidiform moles, respectively--examples of an arrested developmental program. Uniparental disomy of individual chromosomes or portions thereof has been associated with developmental delay or gestational loss. The phenotype of hemizygous mutation or deletion of imprinted genes is modified by the parental origin of the mutant copy, with dichotomous syndromes defined by parental inheritance, as in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Lastly, failure of the imprinting process itself, 'loss of imprinting', may quantitatively alter expression levels of normally imprinted transforming or tumor-suppressing genes, thereby increasing risk for developmental tumors such as Wilms' tumor or choriocarcinoma.

TI  - Some recent developments for regression analysis of multivariate failure time data.  
AB  - Cox's seminal 1972 paper on regression methods for possibly censored failure time data popularized the use of time to an event as a primary response in prospective studies. But one key assumption of this and other regression methods is that observations are independent of one another. In many problems, failure times are clustered into small groups where outcomes within a group are correlated. Examples include failure times for two eyes from one person or for members of the same family. This paper presents a survey of models for multivariate failure time data. Two distinct classes of models are considered: frailty and marginal models. In a frailty model, the correlation is assumed to derive from latent variables ("frailties") common to observations from the same cluster. Regression models are formulated for the conditional failure time distribution given the frailties. Alternatively, marginal models describe the marginal failure time distribution of each response while separately modelling the association among responses from the same cluster. We focus on recent extensions of the proportional hazards model for multivariate failure time data. Model formulation, parameter interpretation and estimation procedures are considered.

TI  - Mechanisms of resistance to therapy and tumor cell survival.  
AB  -  The failure to cure patients with cancer continues to be primarily because of the development of treatment resistance. Both normal and malignant cells die by either programmed cell death (apoptosis) or by cytolysis. Malignant cells have developed mechanisms of resistance that prevent them from entering the programmed cell death pathway as well as mechanisms of escaping immune recognition and cytolysis. These mechanisms include specific protective adaptations involving drug transport, metabolism, and target interactions. Malignant cells may also become resistant to therapy through alterations in genes encoding proteins involved in the initiation of apoptotic pathways. Finally, tumor cells may develop mechanisms to escape immune recognition, making them resistant to T-cell destruction. This article provides an overview of these mechanisms, with emphasis on published articles reported within the past year.

TI  - [Coronary artery bypass surgery-redo operation particularly in patients with a functioning ITA graft or with a patent atheromatous vein graft]  
AB  - An experience with redo-CABG in 20 patients is described. The incidence of reoperation in patients undergoing primary CABG in our hospital was 1.4%, relatively low even in Japanese population. The low incidence of redo-CABG in our hospital depends on the relatively short period of follow-up of 14 years, the prevalence of interventional cardiology and the early routine use of ITA grafts. The main cause of reoperation was the failure of a SVG to the LAD in 70 to 80% of the cases. The most important and difficult decision-making in redo-CABG is the selection of surgical approaches and cardioprotective methods in patients with a patent functioning ITA graft, and the management of an atherosclerotic patent SVG. Surgical strategies in these situations are discussed.
