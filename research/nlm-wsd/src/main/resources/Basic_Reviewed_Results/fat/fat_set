TI  - Factors influencing fatty acids in meat and the role of antioxidants in improving meat quality.  
AB  - Meat has been identified, often wrongly, as a food having a high fat content and an undesirable balance of fatty acids. In fact lean meat is very low in fat (20-50 g/kg), pork and poultry have a favourable balance between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (P:S) and grazing ruminants produce muscle with a desirable n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio. In all species, meat fatty acid composition can be changed via the diet, more easily in single-stomached pigs and poultry where the linoleic, alpha-linolenic and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content responds quickly to raised dietary concentrations. Recent work in pigs has attempted to manipulate the n-6:n-3 ratio by feeding higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid (e.g. in rapeseed) or its products eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) present in fish oils. In ruminants the challenge is to increase the P:S ratio whilst retaining values for n-6:n-3 found in cattle and sheep fed on forage diets. The saturating effect of the rumen can be overcome by feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids which are protected either chemically, by processing, or naturally e.g. within the seed coat. Some protection occurs when grain-based or grass-based diets are fed normally, leading to relatively more n-6 or n-3 fatty acids respectively. These produce different flavours in cooked meat due to the different oxidative changes occurring during storage and cooking. In pigs and poultry, high n-3 fatty acid concentrations in meat are associated with fishy flavours whose development can be prevented with high dietary (supranutritional) levels of the antioxidant vitamin E. In ruminants, supranutritional vitamin E delays the oxidative change of oxymyoglobin to brown metmyoglobin and may also influence the characteristic flavours of beef and lamb.

Ob mRNA/beta-actin concentration in fat biopsies from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was unchanged after 6 days of fasting (1.50 +/- 0.40 vs 1.47 +/- 0.36 arbitrary units, not significant), whereas serum leptin levels decreased significantly from 53.8 +/- 4.7 to 30.7 +/- 2.0 ng/ml (P < 0.0001) during the same period.

TI  - Effects of long-term total fasting and insulin on ob gene expression in obese patients.  
AB  - In the present study the effect of long-term fasting (6 days) on obese (ob) gene expression was examined in nine severely obese females of 34 +/- 3 years and with a body mass index of 46.4 +/- 2.3 kg/m2. Six days of fasting induced a significant weight loss (126.8 +/- 5.3 vs 120.5 +/- 5.1 kg, P < 0.0001). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp, insulin infusion rate 1.5 mU/kg per min) was markedly reduced following fasting (M-value 5.96 +/- 0.74 vs 2.79 +/- 0.23 mg/kg per min, P < 0.0001). Ob mRNA/beta-actin concentration in fat biopsies from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was unchanged after 6 days of fasting (1.50 +/- 0.40 vs 1.47 +/- 0.36 arbitrary units, not significant), whereas serum leptin levels decreased significantly from 53.8 +/- 4.7 to 30.7 +/- 2.0 ng/ml (P < 0.0001) during the same period. No significant correlations were found between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and serum leptin concentration, either prior to the fast or after the fast. Serum leptin levels were unchanged by hyperinsulinemia for 3 h during the clamp prior to the fast, while hyperinsulinemia for 3 h after 6 days of fasting increased serum leptin by 25% (P < 0.01). In conclusion, 6 days of fasting reduced serum leptin by about 40%. In contrast, ob mRNA in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was unchanged. Furthermore, after 6 days of fasting insulin was able to increase the serum level of leptin significantly, indicating that the effect of insulin on the level of leptin is dependent on the nutritional state.

TI  - Tissue angiotensinogen gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide in hypertensive rats.  
AB  - There is now convincing evidence that various tissues express their own tissue renin-angiotensin system, which may be regulated independently of the systemic renin-angiotensin system. However, little information is available on the regulation of the tissue renin-angiotensin system. We investigated the regulation of tissue angiotensinogen gene expression with respect to the development of hypertension. We measured basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated plasma angiotensinogen concentrations by radioimmunoassay and examined the expression of tissue angiotensinogen by Northern blot analysis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) at 4 and 13 weeks of age. Basal plasma angiotensinogen concentration in SHR was comparable to that in WKY at 4 weeks of age and was significantly higher than that in WKY at 13 weeks of age. Lipopolysaccharide induced a significant increase in plasma angiotensinogen concentration in both WKY and SHR at 4 and 13 weeks of age. At 4 weeks of age, the basal levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in the liver, fat, adrenal, and aorta were higher in WKY than in SHR. At 13 weeks of age, the basal levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in the fat, adrenal, aorta, spleen, and kidney were higher in WKY than in SHR, while that in the liver did not differ significantly between the two strains. At 4 weeks of age, pretreatment with lipopolysaccharide increased the angiotensinogen mRNA levels in the liver, fat, adrenal, and aorta in both WKY and SHR. At 13 weeks of age, pretreatment with lipopolysaccharide increased the angiotensinogen mRNA levels in the liver, aorta, and adrenal; decreased those in the spleen; and had no effect in the kidney in both WKY and SHR. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide increased the angiotensinogen mRNA level in fat only in SHR, with no effect in WKY, at 13 weeks of age. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated tumor necrosis factor-a mRNA expression in fat of WKY and SHR, and the increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA level in SHR was significantly greater than that in WKY. Therefore, the increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression may be involved in the increased lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of angiotensinogen gene in fat of SHR at 13 weeks of age. These data suggest that the transcriptional and probably posttranscriptional regulation of angiotensinogen mRNA differs between SHR and WKY, that the regulation of angiotensinogen gene expression is tissue-specific, and that the altered expression of the angiotensinogen gene may be involved in the development of hypertension.

TI  - Testosterone treatment in adolescents with delayed puberty: changes in body composition, protein, fat, and glucose metabolism.  
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated decreased protein breakdown and insulin resistance in pubertal adolescents compared with prepubertal children. Puberty-related increases in sex steroids and/or GH could be potentially responsible. In the present study, the effects of 4 months of testosterone enanthate (50 mg in every 2 weeks) on body composition, protein, fat, and glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in adolescents with delayed puberty. Body composition was assessed by H218O-dilution principle. Protein breakdown, oxidation, and synthesis were measured during primed constant infusion of [1-13C]leucine. Whole-body lipolysis was measured during primed constant infusion of [2H5]glycerol. Insulin action in suppressing proteolysis and lipolysis and stimulating glucose disposal was assessed during a stepwise hyperinsulinemic (10 and 40 mU-m2.min) euglycemic clamp. Fat and glucose oxidation rates were calculated from indirect calorimetry measurements. After 4 months of testosterone treatment, height, weight, and fat free mass (FFM) increased and fat mass, percent body fat, plasma cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins, and leptin levels decreased significantly. Whole-body proteolysis and protein oxidation were lower after testosterone treatment (proteolysis, 0.49 +/- 0.03 vs 0.54 +/- 0.04 g.h.kg FFM, P = 0.032; oxidation, 0.05 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01 g.h.kg FFM, P = 0.015). Protein synthesis was not different, and resting energy expenditure was not different. Total body lipolysis was not affected by testosterone treatment, however, fat oxidation was higher after testosterone (pre-: 2.4 +/- 0.7 vs. post-: 3.5 +/- 0.7 mumol.kg.min, P = 0.031). During the 40 mU.m2.min hyperinsulinemia, insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism was not affected with testosterone therapy (59.1 +/- 8.8 vs. 57.1 +/- 8.2 mumol.kg.min per muU/mL). However, metabolic clearance rate of insulin was higher posttestosterone (13.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 16.7 +/- 0.8 mL.kg.min, P = 0.004). In conclusion, after 4 months of low-dose testosterone treatment in adolescents with delayed puberty 1) FFM increases and fat mass and leptin levels decrease; 2) postabsorptive proteolysis and protein oxidation decrease; 3) fat oxidation increases; and 4) insulin sensitivity in glucose metabolism does not change, whereas insulin clearance increases. These longitudinal observations are in agreement with our previous cross-sectional studies of puberty and demonstrate sparing of protein breakdown of approximately 1.2 g.kg.day FFM, wasting of fat mass, but no change in insulin sensitivity after short periods of low-dose testosterone supplementation.

TI  - Predicting ad libitum dry matter intake and yield of Holstein cows.  
AB  - Two data files, one from New Hampshire (n = 3308) and one from Georgia (n = 678), containing 4-wk or weekly means, respectively, of ad libitum dry matter intakes (DMI) and related variables were used to predict DMI and yields of 4% fat-corrected milk and milk protein in lactating Holstein cows. The DMI ranged from 5.9 to 30.4 kg/d, and milk yield ranged from 5.8 to 64.3 kg/d. Because of the lack of data from < 14 d in milk, prediction was not possible for the first 2 wk of lactation. Factors considered for inclusion in the DMI prediction model were parity number (1 or > or = 2), treatment with bovine somatotropin (bST), day of year, days in milk, minimum (nighttime) temperature-humidity index, body weight, 4% fat-corrected milk yield, milk protein yield, and corn silage and total silage percentages in forage dry matter. In separate models, the silage predictors were replaced with more specific descriptors of ration dry matter, including percentages of crude protein, fat (ether extract plus soaps of fatty acids), concentrate, acid detergent fiber or neutral detergent fiber, and forage acid detergent fiber or neutral detergent fiber. The square and sometimes natural logarithm of predictors were included in models, which then were subjected to a stepwise backward elimination option of a multiple regression procedure. Several useful equations were developed to predict ad libitum DMI; the best models accounted for about 80% of the variability in DMI, and standard deviations were < 9% of mean DMI. Depression in DMI related to heat stress was higher in pluriparous cows than in primiparous cows (22% vs. 6%). The negative coefficient for effects of bST treatment on DMI suggested that milk yield increased proportionally more in response to bST than did DMI. About 74 to 77% of DMI predictions were within 2 kg/d of observed DMI.

TI  - Olive oil increases the magnitude of postprandial chylomicron remnants compared to milk fat and safflower oil.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The acute effects of olive oil, milk fat and safflower oil on postprandial lipemia and remnant lipoprotein metabolism were investigated. METHODS: Eight Healthy male volunteers randomly underwent three types of oral fat-vitamin A loading tests. The test drink was a mixture of retinyl palmitate (RP)(50,000 IU of aqueous vitamin A/m2 body surface area) and one of the three types of oils (40 g of fat/m2 body surface area): olive oil (70.7% oleic acid of total fatty acids); milk fat (69.3% saturated fatty acid); safflower oil (74.2% linoleic acid). RESULTS: Olive oil significantly increased plasma triacylglycerol and RP concentrations 4 hours after fat loading, as compared to other fats. Increases of remnant like particle concentrations were higher after olive oil than after the other two fats. CONCLUSION: These results show that olive oil increases the magnitude of postprandial chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants compared to milk fat and safflower oil.

AB  - Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rapidly fatal illness, usually encountered in infancy, characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and central nervous system involvement. Microscopic examination of tissue shows a non-malignant lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, with prominent erythrophagocytosis. FHL is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder but may develop secondarily to other conditions such as immunosuppression, malignancies, fat overload and certain infections. We recently experienced a case of siblings developing FHL, which may be associated with EBV infection.

TI  - Lipolytic suppression following carbohydrate ingestion limits fat oxidation during exercise.  
AB  - This study determined if the suppression of lipolysis after preexercise carbohydrate ingestion reduces fat oxidation during exercise. Six healthy, active men cycled 60 min at 44 +/- 2% peak oxygen consumption, exactly 1 h after ingesting 0.8 g/kg of glucose (Glc) or fructose (Fru) or after an overnight fast (Fast). The mean plasma insulin concentration during the 50 min before exercise was different among Fast, Fru, and Glc (8 +/- 1, 17 +/- 1, and 38 +/- 5 microU/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). After 25 min of exercise, whole body lipolysis was 6.9 +/- 0.2, 4.3 +/- 0.3, and 3.2 +/- 0.5 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) and fat oxidation was 6.1 +/- 0.2, 4.2 +/- 0.5, and 3.1 +/- 0.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) during Fast, Fru, and Glc, respectively (all P < 0.05). During Fast, fat oxidation was less than lipolysis (P < 0.05), whereas fat oxidation approximately equaled lipolysis during Fru and Glc. In an additional trial, the same subjects ingested glucose (0.8 g/kg) 1 h before exercise and lipolysis was simultaneously increased by infusing Intralipid and heparin throughout the resting and exercise periods (Glc+Lipid). This elevation of lipolysis during Glc+Lipid increased fat oxidation 30% above Glc (4.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.05), confirming that lipolysis limited fat oxidation. In summary, small elevations in plasma insulin before exercise suppressed lipolysis during exercise to the point at which it equaled and appeared to limit fat oxidation.

TI  - Blood and urine acid-base status of premenopausal omnivorous and vegetarian women.  
AB  - The effect of long-term differences in diet composition on whole-body acid-base status was examined in thirty-three young healthy females. The volunteers were recruited from two separate groups matched approximately for age, height and weight; one group regularly ate meat (omnivores; n 20) and one group did not (vegetarians; n 13). All subjects completed a 7 d weighed intake of food, and from their dietary records, total energy, carbohydrate (CHO), fat and protein content were estimated using computer-based food composition tables. During this week they reported to the laboratory on two occasions, following an overnight fast and separated by at least 48 h. Arterialized venous blood samples were obtained on each visit and these were analysed for blood acid-base status. Haemoglobin and packed cell volume, serum total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, serum albumin and total protein were also determined. Two 24 h urine collections were completed; the volume was recorded and samples were analysed for pH, titratable acid and Mg and Ca concentration. Total energy intake of the omnivores was greater (P = 0.0003) than that of the vegetarian group. Dietary intake of CHO (P = 0.024), fat (P = 0.0054) and protein (P = 0.0002) were higher in the omnivorous group than in the vegetarians. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to blood CO2 partial pressure, plasma HCO3- and blood base excess, but blood pH was slightly higher in the omnivores (P = 0.064). Measures of urine acid-base status suggested a lower pH in the omnivore group, but this difference was not statistically significant; a greater titratable acid output was observed with the omnivorous group compared with the vegetarians (48.9 (SE 20.3) v. 35.3 (SE 23.3) mEq/24h; P = 0.018). Although the dietary intake of Ca was not different between the two groups, urinary Ca excretion of the omnivores was significantly higher (3.87 (SD 1.34) v. 3.22 (SD 1.20) mmol/24 h) than that of the vegetarians (P = 0.014). It is suggested that the higher protein intake of the omnivores resulted in an increase in urinary total acid excretion, which may explain the higher rate of Ca excretion.

TI  - Performance, breast meat yield and abdominal fat deposition of male broiler chickens fed diets supplemented with DL-methionine or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue free acid.  
AB  - 1. An experiment was conducted to compare the relative bioefficacy of DL-methionine hydroxy analogue free acid (DL-MHA-FA) with DL-methionine in broiler chickens. Responses used for comparison were weight gain and food efficiency between 7 and 35 d of age, and breast meat deposition, food cost per kg of breast meat, and abdominal fat at 41 d of age. 2. A total of 2160 seven-day-old male broiler chicks were used. The feeding programme consisted of a starter diet from 7 to 21 d, and a finisher diet till the end of the experiment. The starter basal diet contained 6.1 g/kg total sulphur-containing amino acids (TSAA), and an estimated metabolisable energy (ME) content of 13.2 MJ/kg. The finisher diet contained 5.8g/kg TSAA and an estimated ME content of 13.6 MJ/kg. Four concentrations of DL-methionine and DL-MHA-FA were added at 0.5 g/kg increments on an equimolar basis. Therefore, there were 9 experimental treatments which were each applied to 6 replicates of 40 chicks. Weight gain and food efficiency were determined at 35 d of age. Breast yield and carcase fat were measured at 41 d. 3. Significant responses to graded amounts of both methionine sources were observed in weight gain, food efficiency, breast meat percentage, and food cost per kg of breast meat. The responses fitted exponential regression curves. Based on the regression coefficients, equimolar bioefficacy of DL-MHA-FA relative to DL-methionine was 80% for daily gain, 83% for food efficiency, 51% for breast meat yield, and 66% for food cost per kg of breast meat. Differences between the 2 sources were significant (P < 0.05) for breast meat yield and food cost per kg of meat and (P < 0.10) for food efficiency.

TI  - Short term effects of leptin on hepatic gluconeogenesis and in vivo insulin action.  
AB  - Long term administration of leptin decreases caloric intake and fat mass and improves glucose tolerance. Here we examine whether leptin acutely regulates peripheral and hepatic insulin action. Recombinant mouse leptin (0.3 mg/kg.h, Leptin +) or vehicle (Leptin -) were administered for 6 h to 4-month-old rats (n = 20), and insulin (3 milliunits/kg.min) clamp studies were performed. During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin approximately 65 microunits/ml), the rates of whole body glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis and the rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in individual tissues were similar in Leptin - and Leptin +. Post-absorptive hepatic glucose production (HGP) was similar in the two groups. However, leptin enhanced insulin's inhibition of HGP (4.1 +/- 0.7 and 6.2 +/- 0.7 mg/kg.min; p < 0.05). The decreased HGP in the Leptin + group was due to a marked suppression of hepatic glycogenolysis (0.7 +/- 0.1 versus 4.1 +/- 0.6 mg/kg.min, in Leptin + versus Leptin -, respectively; p < 0.001), whereas the % contribution of gluconeogenesis to HGP was markedly increased (82 +/- 3% versus 36 +/- 4% in Leptin + and Leptin -, respectively; p < 0.001). At the end of the 6-h leptin infusion, the hepatic abundance of glucokinase mRNA was decreased, whereas that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA was increased compared with Leptin -. We conclude that an acute increase in plasma leptin 1) enhances insulin's ability to inhibit HGP, 2) does not affect peripheral insulin action, and 3) induces a redistribution of intrahepatic glucose fluxes and changes in the gene expression of hepatic enzymes that closely resemble those of fasting.

TI  - Reconstruction of deformities resulting from penile enlargement surgery [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: More than 30 patients presented for reconstruction of penile deformities secondary to penile enlargement surgery performed by other physicians. Lengthening was performed by releasing the suspensory ligament of the penis and advancing pubic skin with a V-Y advancement flap. Girth was increased by injecting autologous fat. Specific complaints relating to the lengthening procedure involve hypertrophic and/or wide scars, a proximal penile hump from a thick, hair-bearing V-Y flap, and a low hanging penis. Complications relating to autologous fat injections include disappearance of fat, penile lumps and nodules, and shaft deformities. The repair of these deformities is described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1994 through October 1996, 19 men underwent 24 various combinations of reconstructive operations, such as scar revisions, V-Y advancement flap reversal, and removal of fat nodules and asymmetrical fat deposits. RESULTS: Penile appearance and function were improved. Complications include 1 hematoma requiring drainage, minor wound complications and 1 inadequately reversed V-Y flap. CONCLUSIONS: The methods of various repairs are discussed, including reconstructive limitations, timing and staging. Significant improvement can be achieved with proper reconstruction of penile deformities.

TI  - Effect of antioxidant vitamins on the transient impairment of endothelium-dependent brachial artery vasoactivity following a single high-fat meal [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: Much has been written about the potential role of antioxidants in the prevention of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term effect of a single high-fat meal with and without pretreatment with antioxidant vitamins on endothelial function in healthy, normocholesterolemic subjects. DESIGN: Observer-blinded randomized trial. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty healthy, normocholesterolemic (total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <5.2 mmol/L and <3.4 mmol/L [<200 mg/dL and <130 mg/ dL], respectively), male (7) and female (13) hospital employee volunteers, aged 24 to 54 years. INTERVENTION: Three randomly administered breakfasts: (1) a high-fat meal (3766 J [900 calories], 50 g of fat); (2) a low-fat meal (3766 J [900 calories], 0 g of fat); and (3) a high-fat meal and pretreatment with oral administration of vitamins C (1 g) and E (800 IU) (high-fat meal with vitamins). A subgroup of 10 subjects also ate the low-fat meal with the same vitamin pretreatment (low-fat meal with vitamins). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: High-resolution ultrasound assessed flow-mediated (endothelium-dependent) brachial artery vasodilation measured as percent diameter change before and hourly for 6 hours following each meal. RESULTS: Flow-mediated vasodilation fell from a mean+/-SD of 20%+/-8% before to 12%+/-6%, 10%+/-6%, and 8%+/-9% at 2, 3, and 4 hours, respectively, after the high-fat meal (P<.001). No significant changes in flow-mediated vasodilation occurred after the low-fat meal, high-fat meal with vitamins, or low-fat meal with vitamins. The change in flow-mediated vasodilation after the low-fat and high-fat meals correlated inversely with the 2-hour postprandial change in triglyceride levels (r=-0.54; P<.001). CONCLUSION: A single high-fat meal transiently reduces endothelial function for up to 4 hours in healthy, normocholesterolemic subjects, probably through the accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. This decrease is blocked by pretreatment with antioxidant vitamins C and E, suggesting an oxidative mechanism.

TI  - Body composition by x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance in female runners.  
AB  - Body composition interests athletes since athletic performance is influenced by and dependent on the proportion and total amount of fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass. The use of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) has increased recently since portable instruments make the measurements easy to execute and relatively inexpensive. The purpose of this study was to test the degree of relationship between FFM and fat mass calculated in elite female runners with 12 different BIA formulas reported in the literature and measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The present study shows that body composition by BIA is valid in female runners. Prediction equations used to calculate FFM and fat mass must be appropriate for this population subgroup and validated against other methods, such as DXA and hydrodensitometry. Those formulas that performed well in the controls gave poor results in the female runner and vice versa. The below average fat mass noted in female runners suggests that prediction equations for untrained women with average fat mass are inappropriate. The formula by RJL Systems-2 for women: FFM = 5.091 + 0.6483.height2/resistance + 0.1996.weight gave best predictions of FFM in female runners. Further research is necessary to validate BIA prediction formulas in other athletes.

TI  - Quality of life, body composition and muscle strength in adult growth hormone deficiency: the influence of growth hormone replacement therapy for up to 3 years.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adults with GH deficiency complain frequently of low energy levels, emotional lability and mental fatigue resulting in a low perceived quality of life (QOL). Body composition is altered with increased fat mass and decreased lean body mass and muscle strength is reduced. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of replacement GH treatment on: (a) body composition and muscle strength and (b) QOL, using specifically selected and adapted measures. DESIGN: A 12-month study (double-blind placebo-controlled for the first 6 months and open for the second 6 months) of GH replacement injections (0.125 iu/kg/week for the first month and 0.25 iu/kg/week for the following 5 months of each study period) in GH deficient adults on QOL, body composition and muscle strength. This was followed by an open study of a further 12 months' GH treatment assessing QOL and muscle strength. Finally, QOL was assessed after up to 3 years of GH replacement treatment. PATIENTS: Thirty of the 32 adult patients with GH deficiency enrolled completed the initial 12-month study (10 male, mean age 33.5 years, mean (SD) stimulated serum GH response 3.0 mU/l (2.86)). Nineteen patients then opted to continue GH treatment. Of these, 13 patients were available for assessment after a further 12 months' and 24 months' treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Health-related QOL was assessed using 2 specifically adapted scales for adults with GH deficiency: the Life Fulfillment Scale and the Impact Scale. In addition 4 other self-rating questionnaires were used: Nottingham Health Profile, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Self Esteem Scale and Mental Fatigue Scale. Body composition was assessed by DEXA and quadriceps muscle strength by measuring maximum voluntary contractions. RESULTS: In the initial 12 months' placebo-controlled study perceived energy levels increased after 6 and 12 months of GH treatment (P < 0.01 compared with baseline) in the patients receiving GH for the full 12-month period. There were no changes in energy levels throughout the study in the group receiving placebo for the first 6 months. Also small improvements in impact scores were found after 6 months of GH treatment (P < 0.05) but this was not sustained at 12 months. In both GH and placebo groups life fulfillment worsened after 6 months, but then improved to baseline values after 12 months. In the patients who persisted with GH replacement, energy levels continued to improve (at 2 years, P < 0.01 compared with baseline) but then fell (at 3 years, P = NS compared with baseline). A similar pattern was observed in emotional reaction scores. However, improvements in self-esteem were maintained (at 3 years, P < 0.05 compared with baseline). Body composition altered favourably over the initial 12-month study period with a significant increase in lean mass and decrease in fat mass in both groups after 6-12 months of GH. There were no changes in muscle strength in either group during the initial 12-month study. However, in the patients who were available for assessment after a further 12 months of GH treatment, muscle strength increased significantly (P < 0.02 compared with baseline). CONCLUSION: GH replacement treatment for 6-12 months leads to significant improvements in body composition (DEXA) but longer-term treatment may be needed to increase muscle strength. Self-esteem scores improve and are maintained after 3 years of treatment. Energy levels and emotional reaction improve during treatment for up to 2 years but decline thereafter.

TI  - Dietary fat intake and risk of prostate cancer: a prospective study of 25,708 Norwegian men.  
AB  - The relationship between incidence of prostate cancer and intake of dietary fat and foods rich in fat was studied in 25,708 men aged 16-56 years attending a Norwegian health screening in 1977-1983. Linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Central Bureau of Statistics of Norway ensured a complete follow-up until December 31, 1992. Diet was recorded on a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire at the time of screening, and 72 cases of prostate cancer were identified during follow-up. At the end of follow-up, mean age of the total study sample was 56 years (range 19-68), while mean age at diagnosis of prostate cancer was 60 years (range 47-67). No association was found between energy-adjusted intake of total fat, saturated fat, mono-unsaturated fat or poly-unsaturated fat and the incidence of prostate cancer. Significant positive associations were found for body mass index (BMI) and consumption of hamburgers/meatballs, while no association was found with consumption of frankfurters/sausages and a significant negative association with the weekly number of main meals with meat. A significantly increased risk of prostate cancer was associated with skim milk as compared to whole milk. Milk preference (skim vs. whole) was associated significantly positively with BMI. Our study of a relatively young cohort does not confirm previous case-control and cohort studies suggesting that dietary fat, especially from animal sources, is associated positively with risk of prostate cancer.

TI  - Effects of dietary fatty acids on breast and prostate cancers: evidence from in vitro experiments and animal studies.  
AB  - Linoleic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is essential for normal mammary tissue development, at least in part because it provides the metabolic precursor required for the biosynthesis of key eicosanoids. A similar requirement applies to the growth of estrogen-independent but apparently not to estrogen-dependent rodent mammary and human breast carcinoma cells in vitro. By way of lipoxygenase products, n-6 fatty acids also regulate expression of the invasive phenotype.  High-fat, linoleic acid-rich diets promote chemically induced rat mammary carcinogenesis, virally induced mouse mammary tumor development, and the growth and metastasis of estrogen-independent human breast cancer cells in athymic nude mice. In contrast, saturated fatty acids have no discernible effects on mammary carcinogenesis or progression. Most mechanistic studies have focused on the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of n-6 fatty acid metabolism, and support is accumulating for interactions between these eicosanoids and growth factors and oncogenes. The investigation of dietary fatty acids in prostate cancer is at an early stage and has been handicapped by a lack of satisfactory animal models. However, there are indications that the n-6 fatty acids perform functions in experimental prostate cancer progression similar to those described for breast cancer.

TI  - Inverse association of dietary fat with development of ischemic stroke in men [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: A few ecological and cohort studies in Asian populations suggest an inverse association of the intake of both fat and saturated fat with risk of stroke. However, data among western populations are scant. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of stroke incidence with intake of fat and type of fat among middle-aged US men during 20 years of follow-up. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study, a population-based cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 832 men, aged 45 through 65 years, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline (1966-1969). MEASUREMENTS AND DATA ANALYSIS: The diet of each subject was assessed at baseline by a single 24-hour dietary recall, from which intakes of energy and macronutrients were estimated. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, we calculated age-adjusted cumulative incidence rates of stroke. Using Cox regression, we estimated stroke incidence relative risks during 20 years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of ischemic stroke, which occurred in 61 subjects during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Mean intakes were 10975 kJ for energy; 114 g (39% of energy) for total fat; 44 g (15%) for saturated fat; 46 g (16%) for monounsaturated fat; and 16 g (5%) for polyunsaturated fat. Risk of ischemic stroke declined across the increasing quintile of total fat (log-rank trend P=.008), saturated fat (P=.002), and monounsaturated fat (P=.008) but not polyunsaturated fat (P=.33). The age- and energy-adjusted relative risk for each increment of 3% of energy from total fat was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.94); for an increment of 1% from saturated fat, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98); and for 1% from monounsaturated fat, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96). Adjustment for cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance, body mass index, blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, physical activity, and intake of vegetables and fruits and alcohol did not materially change the results. Too few cases of hemorrhagic stroke (n=14) occurred to draw inferences. CONCLUSION: Intakes of fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat were associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke in men.

TI  - Increased plasma leptin/fat ratio in patients with chronic renal failure: a cause of malnutrition?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-energy malnutrition occurs in patients with chronic renal failure primarily due to loss of appetite. The ob gene protein, leptin, which is secreted by adipocytes, regulates body composition by lowering food intake. We have measured plasma leptin in undialysed and dialysed patients and in controls and the concentrations have been related to body composition, dietary intake, and biochemistry. METHODS: Plasma leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay in 93 individuals in groups of undialysed, peritoneal dialysed, and haemodialysed patients and controls. Body composition was determined by DEXA. RESULTS: Protein-energy malnutrition was evident in non-dialysed and dialysed patients from low lean or fat tissues, plasma albumin and transferrin. A third of the dialysis patients were eating less than prescribed intakes. Leptin relative to total fat mass (ng/ml/kg) was significantly greater for patients than for controls, particularly the dialysed patients. Leptin was highly correlated with total, arm, leg, and all other fat measurements, e.g. r for leptin vsm % total fat was: undialysed 0.88, PD 0.81, HD 0.93, and controls 0.83 (P < 0.0001 for all). Dialysis patients with the highest leptin/fat mass ratio had low protein intakes and significantly lower lean tissue mass. Leptin/fat ratio correlated inversely with dietary intake e.g. with protein intake in g/day and marginally in g/kg of ideal weight/day. Leptin concentration was unrelated to plasma creatinine or residual renal function or to the protein 'nutritional indices', albumin and transferrin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that leptin is markedly increased in some patients with chronic renal failure. The association of increased leptin with low protein intake and loss of lean tissue is consistent with leptin contributing to malnutrition but a definitive role cannot be substantiated by this study.

TI  - Effects of soap and detergents on skin surface pH, stratum corneum hydration and fat content in infants.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In adults the influence of cleansing preparations on the pH, fat content and hydration of the skin is well documented. Studies in newborn and small infants have not been reported. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed at examining whether similar effects can be ascertained in infants. METHODS: Infants without skin disease, aged 2 weeks to 16 months, entered an open, controlled and randomized study. Ten infants each had skin washed with tap water (control group), liquid detergent (pH 5.5), compact detergent (pH 5.5) or alkaline soap (pH 9.5). The pH, fat content and hydration were measured before and 10 min after cleansing. Findings were statistically evaluated by parametric covariance analysis. RESULTS: The skin pH increased from an average of 6.60 after cleansing in all groups. The smallest increase (+0.19) was observed in the control group, the largest (+0.45) after washing with alkaline soap. After treatment with liquid or compact detergent, the increase of the pH was only 0.09 higher than for the control group. In comparison to the compact and liquid detergents, the alkaline soap group had a significantly higher increase in pH.  The fat content (mean starting value: 4.34 micrograms/cm2) decreased after washing in all groups; the smallest effect was observed in the control group (decrease of 0.93 micrograms/cm2), the highest for the alkaline soap group (decrease of 4.81 micrograms/cm2). In comparison to the compact and liquid detergents, the alkaline soap group had a higher decrease in fat content. This difference was significant for compact detergents. No statistically significant differences were observed for hydration before versus after washing. CONCLUSION: Each cleansing agent, even normal tap water, influences the skin surface. The increase of the skin pH irritates the physiological protective 'acid mantle', changes the composition of the cutaneous bacterial flora and the activity of enzymes in the upper epidermis, which have an acid pH optimum. The dissolution of fat from the skin surface may influence the hydration status leading to a dry and squamous skin.

AB  - Nutrient intakes based on six days of food intake were collected from 52 elderly Nova Scotian women. Mean reported energy intake was 1600 kilocalories, of which fat contributed 31%. Mean intakes of zinc and Vitamin D were below recommendations. Other nutrients of concern were protein, calcium, folate, and vitamins B6 and B12. Nutrition education efforts should be directed at assisting older people to maintain the generally recommended low fat intake, while stressing the desirability of a balanced food intake of sufficient quantity, which includes low-fat milk and dairy products, lean meats and legumes as sources of nutrients in low supply.

TI  - Effect of 360His mutation in apolipoprotein A-IV on plasma HDL-cholesterol response to dietary fat.  
AB  - In order to determine whether genetic variability of apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV is responsible for the improvement in lipid profile when dietary saturated fats are replaced by carbohydrates or monounsaturated fats, 41 healthy male subjects were studied: 33 were homozygous for the 360Gln allele and 8 were heterozygote carriers of the 360His allele. These were administered three consecutive 4-week diets. The first was a diet rich in saturated fat (SAT diet, with 38% fat, 20% saturated. This was followed by a low fat diet (NCEP-I, with < 30% fat, < 10% saturated). The final diet was rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA diet, with 38% fat, 22% monounsaturated). There was no difference in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels of both groups of individuals after consuming the SAT diet. Switching from this diet to the NCEP-I diet, carriers of the 360His allele presented a greater decrease in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (-10 vs. -1 mg/dL, P < 0.004) and apoA-I levels (-19 vs. -8 mg/dL, P < 0.037). Similarly, replacement of carbohydrates by monounsaturated fats produced a greater increase in HDL-C (9 vs. 1 mg/dL, P < 0.003) and apoA-I levels (9 vs. 2 mg/dL, P < 0.036) in carriers of the 360His mutation. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activities and apoA-IV levels were also measured. However, no genotype-related differences were observed for these parameters. Our results suggest that variability in HDL-C and apoA-I response to diet is, at least partially, determined by the 360His mutation of apoA-IV.

TI  - Genetic determinants of plasma lipoprotein levels and their dietary response.  
AB  - Hamsters were fed diets containing fat (5-20%, w/w) consisting of triolein (TO) alone or 50% triolein plus 50% trimyristin (TM), tripalmitin (TP) or tristearin (TS) for 28 days. Each fat had unique effects on lipoprotein concentrations which were related to changes in the expression of hepatic genes. Tripalmitin was the most hypercholesterolaemic of the saturated fats, causing dose-dependent increases in LDL and HDL cholesterol which correlated with decreases in the expression of HMGCoA reductase and LDL receptor genes. Tripalmitin also increased the expression of the apoB gene. It seems likely that fatty acids may regulate genes which are involved both in the synthesis and clearance of plasma lipoproteins. Inclusion of increasing amounts of cholesterol in diets containing 20% fat (50% TO plus 50% TP or TS) caused down-regulation of HMGCoAR and LDLR genes and up-regulation of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) gene for both fats. This was accompanied by increased LDL-cholesterol in the TP but not the TS group. In all experiments the concentration of VLDL-cholesterol correlated with the hepatic cholesterylester and MTP mRNA concentrations.

TI  - Effect of dietary fat on codon 12 and 13 Ha-ras gene mutations in 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-induced rat mammary gland tumors.  
AB  - Activating mutations in and expression of the Ha-ras gene were examined in benign and malignant female Sprague-Dawley rat mammary gland tumors induced by the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and promoted by a diet high in polyunsaturated fat. Ha-ras mutations were detected in codons 12 and 13 by selective polymerase chain reaction amplification of mutated sequences and nucleotide sequencing. The percentage of Ha-ras mutations in carcinomas from PhIP-treated rats was significantly higher in rats on a low-fat diet than in rats on a high-fat diet (82% (nine of 11) vs 26% (seven of 27), respectively, P < 0.01). In addition, whereas 56% of the carcinomas with Ha-ras mutations from rats on a low-fat diet carried double Ha-ras mutations, none of the carcinomas from rats on a high-fat diet had double mutations. Ha-ras mutations were also detected in benign tumors (largely adenomas) induced by PhIP in rats on different diets; two of eight and three of four benign tumors examined from rats on low-fat and high-fat diets, respectively, had Ha-ras mutations, suggesting that activating Ha-ras mutations alone are not sufficient for PhIP-induced tumors to become malignant. No differences were observed in the level of Ha-ras mRNA expression in the different groups. In our animal model, a high-fat diet increased the incidence and percentage of malignant PhIP-induced mammary gland tumors yet decreased the percentage of carcinomas showing Ha-ras mutations. Thus, the complement of genetic alterations associated with PhIP-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis is probably altered by the level of dietary fat.

TI  - Effects of dietary L-carnitine supplementation and protein level on performance and degree of meatness and fatness of broilers.  
AB  - Feeding high-protein diets to broilers is a known means for improving performance and carcass composition and quality, however, the combined effects of dietary protein (CP) level concurrent with L-carnitine (CN) supplementation are not known. Performance and carcass traits of broilers fed CN-supplemented diets of different CP-levels were studied from 18 to 53 days of age. Three isocaloric diets containing 18, 20 or 22% CP were formulated, with or without added CN (50 mg/kg), and used. Apart from CP level, supplemental CN attained significantly higher body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion (FC), means of BWG were 351 vs. 332 and 371 vs. 353 g, and those of FC were 1.25 vs. 1.33 and 1.73 vs. 1.84 for the first and second week of the experimental period, respectively. Amount and percentage of abdominal fat and ether extract (EE) contents of breast meat of 53-day-old broilers were significantly reduced (means of AF were 43.5 vs. 51.5 g, equivalent to 1.98 vs. 2.39%, those of EE were 1.82 vs. 2.24%) in response to CN supplementation. A significant interaction between added CN and CP level was noted on BWG and FC of broilers from 18 to 32 days of age.

TI  - Brown fat thermogenesis in rats fed high-fat diets enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible involvement of an increase in diet-induced thermogenesis from brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) induced limitation of the development of white fat pads during high-fat feeding. DESIGN: Rats fed for four weeks on a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (C group) or high-fat diet without n-3 PUFA (REF group), with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA group), with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA group) or with a mixture of these two fatty acids (MIX group). MEASUREMENTS: Epididymal and retroperitoneal fat pad mass, BAT composition, Guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) binding and uncoupling protein (UCP) content were measured in the five groups of rats. RESULTS: The masses of retroperitoneal and epididymal white fat pads were lower in the groups fed n-3 PUFA than in the C and REF groups. The total BAT GDP binding was 1.6 times higher in the MIX and EPA groups than in the REF group. The BAT from the EPA group presented an enrichment in mitochondria compared to the C and REF groups whereas the BAT from the DHA and REF groups presented a hyperplasia and an increase in thermogenic activity of the mitochondria compared to the C group. The higher thermogenic activity of BAT was observed in the MIX group and is due to hyperplasia and to an increase in thermogenic activity of mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFA induce a marked stimulation of BAT thermogenic activity without changes in the UCP content compared to a high-fat diet without n-3 PUFA. The mixture of EPA and DHA has the more pronounced effect while EPA and DHA seem to act in synergy on BAT thermogenesis via different mechanisms.

TI  - Imaging articular cartilage defects with 3D fat-suppressed echo planar imaging: comparison with conventional 3D fat-suppressed gradient echo sequence and correlation with histology.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to shorten examination time in articular cartilage imaging by use of a recently developed 3D multishot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with fat suppression (FS). We performed comparisons with 3D FS GE sequence using histology as the standard of reference. METHOD: Twenty patients with severe gonarthrosis who were scheduled for total knee replacement underwent MRI prior to surgery. Hyaline cartilage was imaged with a 3D FS EPI and a 3D FS GE sequence. Signal intensities of articular structures were measured, and contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratios were calculated. Each knee was subdivided into 10 cartilage surfaces. From a total of 188 (3D EPI sequence) and 198 (3D GE sequence) cartilage surfaces, 73 and 79 histologic specimens could be obtained and analyzed. MR grading of cartilage lesions on both sequences was based on a five grade classification scheme and compared with histologic grading. RESULTS: The 3D FS EPI sequence provided a high C/N ratio between cartilage and subchondral bone similar to that of the 3D FS GE sequence. The C/N ratio between cartilage and effusion was significantly lower on the 3D EPI sequence due to higher signal intensity of fluid. MR grading of cartilage abnormalities using 3D FS EPI and 3D GE sequence correlated well with histologic grading. 3D FS EPI sequence agreed within one grade in 69 of 73 (94.5%) histologically proven cartilage lesions and 3D FS GE sequence agreed within one grade in 76 of 79 (96.2%) lesions. The gradings were identical in 38 of 73 (52.1%) and in 46 of 79 (58.3%) cases, respectively. The difference between the sensitivities was statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: The 3D FS EPI sequence is comparable with the 3D FS GE sequence in the noninvasive evaluation of advanced cartilage abnormalities but reduces scan time by a factor of 4.

TI  - Influence of kid rearing systems on milk composition and yield of Murciano-Granadina dairy goats.  
AB  - One-hundred eight lactations of Murciano-Granadina goats from different years were used to compare two kid rearing systems. Goats were separated into two groups: suckling and milking. Dams in the suckling group were milked once daily until kids were weaned (wk 0 to 7) and then were milked twice daily. Dams in the milking group were separated from their kids at 48 h after birth; then, kids were raised artificially, and goats were milked twice daily. Total milk yield was estimated according to the oxytocin method during suckling. Stage of lactation, parity, prolificacy, and year effects on milk yield and composition were also studied. As expected, during the first 7 wk of lactation, marketable milk was higher for dams that were milked than for dams that were suckled. Neither milk yield nor milk composition throughout the entire lactation was affected by group or prolificacy with the exception of the percentage of milk CP. The lactation curve peaked at wk 4 or 5 and declined slowly afterward. First parity goats had the lowest milk yield but the highest fat and protein percentages. Third parity goats had the highest milk yield. The separation of kids from their dams after birth did not affect total lactation performance because of the minimal importance of the neuroendocrine milk ejection reflex in goats compared with that of other ruminants.

TI  - The effect of dietary changes on plasma lipids and lipoproteins of six Labrador retrievers.  
AB  - Six healthy, spayed female Labrador Retrievers (aged 5.5 to 11 years), kept under controlled conditions of exercise and housing, were fed a diet of 15 per cent fat, 24 per cent carbohydrate and 33 per cent protein for two weeks before and between each of three test diets, of differing fat to carbohydrate ratios (A 13:44, B 20:33, C 25:26 fat:carbohydrate gm per cent dry weight) given in a predetermined order for four weeks each. Fasting plasma lipoproteins and total fatty acids were measured weekly. In the fourth week of each test period post-prandial plasma lipoproteins were measured. Diets B and C increased total (P < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05) whilst diet A increased HDL triglyceride (P < 0.05). Eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) increased on diets B and C, and oleic acid (C18:1) on diet A. Post-prandial hypertriglyceridaemia occurred on all diets. Chylomicron clearance was slower on higher fat diets. Relatively small dietary changes produced significant alterations of plasma lipids, lipoproteins and chylomicron clearance.

TI  - [Low energy metabolism in persons predisposed to obesity: significance of the thyroid status]  
AB  - A low resting metabolic rate (RMR) for a given body composition has been identified as a risk factor for weight gain and obesity, and has also been reported in formerly obese individuals with the genetic predisposition to obesity. The possible role of thyroid hormone in low RMR was studied in a large sample of postobese women. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry in 28 weight-stable postobese women with a family history of obesity (PO group) and in a control group of 28 nonobese women closely matched for age, fat mass, and fat-free mass. RMR was 8% lower in the PO than in the control group (95% CI: 5856 kJ/d [5520-6214] vs 6408 kJ/d [6096-6768]), (p < 0.02). The group difference remained unchanged after fat-free mass and fat mass were adjusted for (552 kJ/d, p < 0.015). The PO group had lower plasma free triiodothyronine: 2.4 (1.9-3.0) compared with 3.5 pmol/l (2.9-3.9), (p < 0.01), whereas plasma androstenedione only tended to be lower in the PO. Adjustment for differences in androstenedione did not reduce the difference in RMR, whereas adjustment for differences in plasma free triiodothyronine eliminated the group difference (96 kJ/d, p = 0.59). The present study shows that RMR for a given body composition is lower among postobese than among matched never-obese control subjects. Statistically the lower plasma free triiodothyronine concentration of the postobese subjects could explain their lower RMRs, but it remains to be established whether these findings are causally related.

TI  - Malabsorption in systemic lupus erythematosus.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen patients with SLE for malabsorption. METHODS: Twenty-one patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE were enrolled in the study. Patients were screened for malabsorption by the D-Xylose test (DXT) and by microscopic examination of the stool for fat droplets. All patients underwent upper GI endoscopy with biopsy from the second portion of the duodenum. The specimen was examined for morphologic abnormalities and for the presence of IgG, IgM, IgA, and kappa and lambda light chains. Ten patients without SLE served as controls. RESULTS: A history of abdominal pain and occasional diarrhea was elicited in 2/21 patients. These patients were found to have an abnormal DXT and excessive fecal fat excretion. In one of these patients, histologic examination revealed flattened and deformed villi with an inflammatory infiltrate. Two other patients showed isolated excessive fecal fat excretion with a normal microscopic appearance of the mucosa. In 20/21 patients the small bowel histology was normal. In all patients, immunoperoxidase staining revealed a normal quantity and distribution of the immunoglobulins and light chains within the intestinal mucosa. No correlation was demonstrated between CH50, C3, C4, anti-dsDNA levels and the malabsorption. CONCLUSION: In this series of SLE patients, the prevalence of malabsorption was 9.5%, and was even higher if isolated fat malabsorption was considered. A search for malabsorption in patients with SLE, and in particular in those with abdominal complaints, is recommended. The pathogenesis is not yet clear and warrants further investigation.

TI  - Energy and fat compensation during long-term consumption of reduced fat products.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral response to the long term realistic consumption of reduced fat products. During six months, a control group of 103 subjects had free access to about 45 commercially available full-fat products, and a reduced-fat group of 117 subjects had access to the reduced fat equivalents. These experimental products covered about 37% of total energy intake in the control group and 30% of energy intake in the reduced fat group. Other non-experimental food products were bought in regular shops. The results showed that, compared to a baseline measurement before the start of the study, energy intake increased from 10.4 MJ/day to 11.2 MJ/d in the control group, whereas it remained constant at 10.2 MJ/d in the reduced fat group. Fat intake in the control group increased from 99 g/d (35.6en%) to 123g/d (40.6en%), whereas fat intake in the reduced fat group decreased from 95 g/d (34.en%) to 90 g/d (32.7en%). The energy and fat intake from experimental products was lower in the reduced fat group (3.1 MJ/d, 37 g fat/d) than in the control group (4.2 MJ/d, 71 g fat/d). There was some compensatory response in the consumption of experimental products: the ingested amount of experimental products was about 10% higher in the reduced fat group (447 g/d) than in the control group (399 g/d)[t = 2.6; p < 0.01]. There was no compensatory response in the consumption of non-experimental products. Both the control and reduced fat group consumed about 7.1 MJ/d and 53 g fat/d from non-experimental products. It is concluded that long term consumption of reduced fat products leads to a lower energy and fat intake, compared to the consumption of full-fat products.

TI  - The effect of sire breed on the melting point and fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat in steers.  
AB  - Fatty acid composition and the melting point of subcutaneous fat was determined in 18 Hereford, 25 Brahman x Hereford, 22 Simmental x Hereford, and 15 Friesian x Hereford steers that were grown out on pasture at two sites and slaughtered when the mean weight of the Herefords at each site was ca. 450 kg. Multivariate and univariate analyses tested the relations of fatty acid composition, degree of saturation, and melting point with sire breed, environment, age, and carcass characteristics. Hereford and Brahman steers were fatter than the Simmental and Friesian steers. Fat from Brahman-sired steers had a melting point 2.5 degrees C lower than fat from the Bos taurus-sired steers at the same age and had a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, independent of variation in carcass weight and fatness. Melting point and degree of saturation decreased as age increased. Step-down discriminant analyses identified a set of three acids (14:0, 16:0, and 17:1) that differed among sire breeds, independent of differences in melting point: the acids 14:0 and 16:0 discriminated between Brahman and Bos taurus steers and 17:1 between Hereford and Simmental and Friesian steers. Increase in fatness was associated with an increase in 17:1, but, at the same fatness, no acids discriminated among the Bos taurus-sired steers. The use of Bos indicus cattle or their crossbreeds in situations in which hard-setting fat is likely may mitigate the problem.

TI  - Effect of modified dairy fat on postprandial and fasting plasma lipids and lipoproteins in healthy young men.  
AB  - Fatty acid profile of milk fat can be modified by cow feeding strategies. Our aim was postprandially and after 4 wk to compare the effect of a modified milk fat (M diet) [with 16% of the cholesterolemic saturated fatty acid (C12-16) replaced by mainly oleic and stearic acids] with the effect of D diet, including a conventional Danish milk fat on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. A side effect of the cow feeding regime was a 5% (w/w) increase in trans fatty acid in M diet. Eighteen subjects were fed for two periods of 4 wk strictly controlled isoenergetic test diets with 40% of energy from total fat and the same content of dietary cholesterol in a randomized study with cross-over design. Contrary to expectations, fasting low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration did not differ after the experimental periods. However, M diet resulted in a higher fasting total triacylglycerol concentration compared to D diet (P = 0.009). Postprandial samples were taken at two different occasions (i) at day 21, after breakfast and lunch and (ii) on the last day of the study 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after a fat load. Postprandial plasma triacylglycerol and chylomicron triacylglycerol showed higher peak values after D diet than M diet (interaction effect, diet x times P < 0.05). In conclusion, M diet did not lower LDL cholesterol compared to D diet. Thus any cholesterol-lowering effect of oleic and stearic acids may have been obscured by the high content of cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids in milk fat. A higher content of the trans fatty acids in M diet might have counteracted the cholesterol neutral/decreasing effect and increased plasma triacylglycerol.

TI  - The effect of fat composition of the diet on energy metabolism.  
AB  - Animal and human studies show that polyunsaturated fatty acids (P) are oxidized more rapidly than saturated fatty acids (S). There are indications that diets high in P/S ratio result in a relatively high resting metabolic rate (RMR) and high diet induced thermogenesis (DIT). However, studies with human subjects are limited. The effect of dietary fatty acid composition on energy metabolism was studied in 6 male subjects, age 25-48 y. Two diets were supplied, each over a period of 14 days, in a randomized crossover design with a washout period of 14 days. P/S ratios of the diets were 0.19 and 1.67. On day 14, RMR was determined in the morning in fasting state by means of indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood), followed by a 4 hour measurement of the DIT after consumption of a standardized meal of 3.3 MJ with the same fatty acid composition as during the dietary period. The meal contained 46, 37, and 17 % energy as fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively. RMR after the period with the high P/S diet was significantly higher than after the period of the low P/S diet. The average difference (+/- SD) was 0.17 +/- 0.14 kJ/min or 3.6 +/- 2.7 % of RMR. The DIT was also higher in all subjects during a breakfast with a high P/S ratio. The average difference was 0.29 +/- 0.16 kJ/min, which is 22.1 +/- 12.6 % of DIT. The study showed that a prolonged food intake of a diet with a high P/S ratio results in a relatively high RMR and DIT. These results indicate the importance of dietary lipid profile in the treatment of obesity.

TI  - Glucose-fatty acid interactions in health and disease.  
AB  - It is widely held that although obesity and type 2 diabetes are polygenic in origin, the primary defect causing both conditions is insulin resistance, which in turn gives rise to a constellation of other abnormalities, including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and (in the genetically predisposed) frank hyperglycemia. Explored here is an alternative, albeit speculative, scenario in which hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance arise either simultaneously or sequentially from some preexisting defect within the leptin signaling pathway. In either case, a central component of the model is that the breakdown of glucose homeostasis that is characteristic of the condition of obesity with type 2 diabetes is secondary to disturbances in lipid dynamics. The possibility is raised that abnormally high concentrations of malonyl-CoA in liver and skeletal muscle suppress the activity of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and thus fatty acid oxidation in both sites. It is suggested that the buildup of fat within the muscle cell (caused in part by excessive delivery of VLDLs from the liver) interferes with glucose transport or metabolism or both, producing insulin resistance. Elevated circulating concentrations of fatty acids are also implicated in the etiology of type 2 diabetes by virtue of 1) their powerful acute insulinotropic effect, 2) their ability to exacerbate insulin resistance in muscle, and 3) their long-term detrimental action on pancreatic beta-cell function.

TI  - Fuel partitioning and food intake.  
AB  - Fuel metabolism generates signals that the brain uses to control food intake. Because the influence of metabolism on eating behavior depends on where and in what way metabolic fuels are utilized, the partitioning of fuels among different tissues and between metabolic pathways has significant effects on food intake. There is substantial evidence that shifts in fat fuel partitioning between oxidation and storage influence food intake, and data indicate that this may also be the case for carbohydrates. Carbohydrate and fat fuel interactions appear to affect eating behavior, and may play a role in the overconsumption of high-fat diets. A mechanism for the control of eating behavior that is sensitive to a stimulus generated at the level of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production may underlie changes in food intake associated with shifts in fuel partitioning. A model based on such a mechanism provides a framework for understanding changes in food intake under a variety of conditions associated with alterations in energy storage and expenditure, including obesity and cachexia.

TI  - Adipose tissue omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content and breast cancer in the EURAMIC study. European Community Multicenter Study on Antioxidants, Myocardial Infarction, and Breast Cancer.  
AB  - The fatty acid content of adipose tissue in postmenopausal breast cancer cases and controls from five European countries in the European Community Multicenter Study on Antioxidants, Myocardial Infarction, and Cancer (EURAMIC) breast cancer study (1991-1992) was used to explore the hypothesis that fatty acids of the omega-3 family inhibit breast cancer and that the degree of inhibition depends on background levels of omega-6 polyunsaturates. Considered in isolation, the level of omega-3 or omega-6 fat in adipose tissue displayed little consistent association with breast cancer across study centers. The ratio of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids to total omega-6 fat showed an inverse association with breast cancer in four of five centers. In Malaga, Spain, the odds ratio for the highest tertile relative to the lowest reached 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82). In this center, total omega-6 fatty acid was strongly associated with breast cancer. With all centers pooled, the odds ratio for long-chain omega-3 to total omega-6 reached 0.80 for the second tertile and 0.65 for the third tertile, a downward trend bordering on statistical significance (p for trend = 0.055). While not definitive, these results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fat may play a role in breast cancer.

TI  - Radiologic and pathologic correlation of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To demonstrate the radiologic-pathologic correlation of adenomyomatosis of gallbladder (GBA) and emphasize the role of high-resolution real-time ultrasound (RTUS) in the diagnosis of GBA. METHODS: Ten (four male and six female, mean age = 49 years) patients with proven GBA (three diffuse, three segmental, and four fundal) diagnosed by histopathology or confirmed by oral cholecystography (OCG) were reviewed. Radiologic studies included OCG (n = 8), RTUS (n = 8), and computed tomography (CT; n = 4). Six patients subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. RESULTS: Histopathologic correlation between pathologic specimens and OCG, RTUS, and CT was possible in six patients. The diagnostic criteria with ultrasound included numerous tiny intramural cysts containing echogenic foci with reverberation artifacts and associated segmental or diffuse gallbladder wall thickening. OCG with fatty meal demonstrated intramural diverticula. Localized fundal GBA was better visualized on RTUS and CT scan than on OCG. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis of GBA may be made by either OCG or high-resolution RTUS preoperatively. CT scan may used as an alternative method to help make the diagnosis in equivocal cases.

TI  - Decreased corticosteroid-binding globulin in burn patients: relationship with interleukin-6 and fat in nutritional support.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effect of low-fat nutritional solutions, with or without fish oil, on serum interleukin (IL)-6, and to explore the relationships between IL-6, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG; the main cortisol carrier in plasma), and protein metabolism in severely burned adult patients. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study with control and low fat-fed groups. SETTING: Burn center of Hotel-Dieu Hospital of Montreal. PATIENTS: Thirty-seven men and women with thermal burn injury over >20% of body surface area and no other known medical condition. INTERVENTIONS: Within 24 hrs after admission, nutritional support was started through a gastroenteral tube inserted under endoscopic guidance. The goal for energy intake was calculated using the Curreri formula, and was adjusted with biweekly measurements of resting energy expenditure. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (35% of energy as fat); low fat 1 (15% of energy as fat); and low fat 2 (50% of fat in the form of fish oil). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta, IL-6, CBG, and cortisol free fraction were measured every 3 days for 28 days. Nitrogen balance and urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion were measured daily. IL-6 concentrations were high in all patients, with the highest value (460 +/- 111 units/mL) observed on day 4. Concentrations of IL-6 were higher in control patients than in low fat-fed patients between days 13 and 28, but not between days 1 and 13. Multivariate analysis showed that IL-6, total body surface area burned, and sepsis scores were independent predictors of CBG between days 1 and 13 (n = 170; p<.00001). High IL-6 concentrations were predictors of low CBG concentrations and high cortisol free fractions. There was no relationship between IL-6, nitrogen balance, and 3-methylhistidine excretion. TNF-alpha and TNF-beta activity measurements by biological assay showed no correlation with other factors measured. CONCLUSIONS: a) Low-fat feeding, with or without fish oil, does not change the early production of IL-6 after burn injury; b) serum IL-6 is negatively correlated with CBG, which supports the hypothesis that this cytokine inhibits hepatic CBG production; and c) IL-6 does not appear to directly influence protein metabolism in burn patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A non-invasive test for assessment of fat digestion has been developed based on the intraluminal hydrolysis of cholesteryl-[1-13C]octanoate by pancreatic esterase. AIMS: To determine the diagnostic performance of this breath test in the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function. METHODS: The test was performed in 20 healthy controls, 22 patients with chronic pancreatic disease (CPD), four with biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), and 32 with non-pancreatic digestive diseases (NPD); results were compared with those of other tubeless tests (faecal chymotrypsin and fluorescein dilaurate test). RESULTS: Hourly recoveries of 13CO2 were significantly lower in CPD when compared with healthy controls or NPD. In patients with CPD with mild to moderate insufficiency, the curve of 13CO2 recovery was similar to that of healthy controls, while in those with severe insufficiency it was flat. In three patients with CPD with severe steatorrhoea, a repeat test after pancreatic enzyme supplementation showed a significant rise in 13CO2 recovery. The four BPD patients had low and delayed 13CO2 recovery. Only eight of the 32 patients with NPD had abnormal breath test results. There was a significant correlation between the results of the breath test and those of faecal chymotrypsin, the fluorescein dilaurate test, and faecal fat measurements. For the diagnosis of pancreatic disease using the three hour cumulative 13CO2 recovery test, the sensitivity was 68.2% and specificity 75.0%; values were similar to those of the other two tubeless pancreatic function tests. In seven healthy controls, nine patients with CPD, and nine with NPD a second breath test was performed using Na-[1-13C]octanoate and a pancreatic function index was calculated as the ratio of 13C recovery obtained in the two tests: at three hours this index was abnormal in eight patients with CPD and in three with NPD. CONCLUSION: The cholesteryl-1[1-13C]octanoate breath test can be useful for the diagnosis of fat malabsorption and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

TI  - Lipo layering of autologous fat: an improved technique with promising results.  
AB  - When using free fat autologous grafts as a filling material was first proposed in 1893 by Neuber, the idea rapidly gained enthusiasm and endorsements. Our early experience with autologous fat transplantation was disappointing, but even then it was clear that fat could be transferred with partial success. Since then, further clinical works by Guerrerosantos, Coleman, and others have shown that it is possible, by careful handling of transplanted fat, to improve the survival of this tissue. We have reviewed our recent experiences and have found several patients with whom autologous fat transplant has been successful with up to an 8-year postoperative follow-up.

TI  - Sugar-induced blood pressure elevations over the lifespan of three substrains of Wistar rats.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since the majority of studies concerned with sugar-induced blood pressure elevation have principally been short-term, the present investigation followed the effects of heavy sucrose ingestion on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and related parameters over the lifespan of three substrains of Wistar rats. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-five rats (75 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 75 Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), 75 Munich Wistar rats (WAM) were given one of five diets. The baseline diet in terms of calories derived 32% from sucrose, 33% from protein, and 35% from fat. The remaining four diets derived their calories as follows: a high sugar-low protein diet--52% of calories from sucrose, 15% from protein, and 33% from fat; a high sugar-low fat diet--53% of calories from sucrose, 37% from protein, and 10% from fat; a low sugar-high protein diet--11% calories from sucrose, 56% from protein, and 33% from fat, and a low sugar-high fat--13% of calories from sucrose, 32% from protein, and 55% from fat. RESULTS: All substrains showed the highest systolic blood pressure when ingesting the two diets highest in sucrose. The highest sugar-induced SBP elevation, which remained over the lifespan of all substrains, was found in SHR. WKY had an intermediate elevation. WAM showed the lowest responses, although the average elevation of 6-8 mm Hg was statistically significant. The following parameters could not be correlated with long-term elevation of SBP; body weight, catecholamine excretion, renal function, and plasma renin activity. Only insulin concentrations correlated: insulin concentrations were consistently higher in the two groups of WKY and WAM consuming the high sucrose diets. CONCLUSIONS: High dietary sucrose can chronically increase SBP in three substrains of Wistar rats. Increased concentrations of circulating insulin were found in WKY and WAM suggesting that the glucose/insulin system was involved, at least in these two substrains, in the maintenance of high SBP levels during chronic, heavy sugar ingestion.

TI  - Psychosocial correlates of healthful diets among male auto workers.  
AB  - A better understanding of factors associated with healthful eating practices can improve the design and evaluation of dietary intervention programs. Up to now, little information has been available about these factors in high-risk but healthy populations. This article presents findings of a study of psychosocial factors, including stage of change, and their relationship to patterns of consumption of dietary fat, fiber, and fruits and vegetables in a population of males at increased risk of colorectal cancer. Data are from the baseline survey for the Next Step Trial, a randomized, controlled trial of worksite nutrition and colorectal cancer screening promotion interventions. The respondents (n = 2764) were actively employed or retired auto workers at increased colorectal cancer risk. The psychosocial constructs measured were predisposing factors (benefits, motivation, knowledge; eight items; Cronbach alpha = 0.50), enabling factors (barriers, norms, social support; six items; Cronbach alpha = 0.55), and stages of change for adopting diets lower in fat and higher in fiber/fruits and vegetables. The measures of diet, assessed with a food frequency questionnaire, were intakes of fat, fiber, and servings of fruits and vegetables. There were strong and statistically significant positive associations between both predisposing and enabling scale scores and stages of change for fat and fiber. The percentage of respondents in maintenance stage ranged from 4-80% for fat and 11-81% for fiber, across low to high predisposing scale scores; for enabling scale scores, ranges were 11-71% for fat and 22-81% for fiber. Stage of change was associated with fat, fiber, and fruit and vegetable intake in a stepwise manner, with the greatest change observed between action and maintenance. Correlations with dietary outcomes were significantly greater for predisposing factors (r = -0.30 for fat and 0.36 for fiber) than for enabling factors (r = -0.23 for fat and 0.28 for fiber). Multiple regression models, which included the predisposing and enabling factor scales, stage of change, and covariates related to diet, explained a total of between 16 and 27% of the variance in diet. Predisposing and enabling factors are significantly associated with of stage of change and current diet in this high-risk sample of male auto workers. Stage of change is the strongest correlate examined and seems to serve as a mediating factor for dietary change. Results from the Next Step Trial will provide additional data on whether and how health promotion interventions influence these factors, and whether such changes are associated with dietary change.

TI  - Usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging with dynamic contrast enhancement and fat suppression in detecting a pancreatic tumor.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the value of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fat suppression in detecting a pancreatic tumor. The subjects were 19 patients with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma and six patients with islet cell tumor where diagnosis was established pathologically. Breath-hold gradient echo images, breath-hold gradient echo images with fat suppression and breath-hold gradient echo images with dynamic enhancement at 1.5 T were obtained for all patients. The efficacies of these three imaging techniques were compared by calculating the contrast-to-noise ratio, as indicative of conspicuousness between a tumor-affected and a normal pancreas. As for adenocarcinoma, our results indicated that the usefulness in detecting the tumor was high, decreasing in the order dynamic contrast images > fat suppression images > plain images, and that the difference between any two of these three types of image was statistically significant. On the other hand, these imaging techniques showed no statistically significant difference in detecting islet cell tumors. In conclusion, dynamic MRI is the best method for detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As the fat suppression technique has the advantage of being non-invasive, this method is suitable for screening studies of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, no advantage was recognized in using the fat suppression technique for detecting an islet cell tumor in comparison with plain MRI.

TI  - Beta-casomorphins stimulate and enterostatin inhibits the intake of dietary fat in rats.  
AB  - The effects of beta-casomorphins 1-7, 1-5 and 1-4 on food intake of rats adapted to either a high fat (HF) or high carbohydrate (HC) diet have been studied and compared to the effects of enterostatin. Intracerebroventricular (icv) beta-casomorphin1-7 (beta-CM1-7) stimulated intake of HF diet in overnight fasted rats, but beta-CM1-5 and beta-CM1-4 were ineffective. Peripheral injection of beta-CM1-7 also increased the intake of a high fat diet, but reduced the intake of HC diet in satiated rats. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) beta-CM1-7 caused a dose-dependent increase in the intake of HF diet, but a dose-dependent inhibition of HC ingestion in satiated rats. Enterostatin (ICV) inhibited the beta-CM1-7 stimulation of HF intake, as did the general opioid antagonist naloxone. Ligand binding studies with [3H-pro] enterostatin identified on low affinity binding site (Kd 100nM) on a crude brain membrane preparation. This binding was displaced by beta-CM1-7, beta-CM1-5 and beta-CM1-4. These data suggest that at high doses enterostatin and beta-CM1-7 may interact with the same low affinity receptor to modulate intake of dietary fat.

TI  - A single-scan imaging technique for measurement of the relative concentrations of fat and water protons and their transverse relaxation times.  
AB  - A two-component chemical-shift-imaging technique is described from which fat and water images can be obtained in a single scan and in the presence of an inhomogeneous field. In addition, the method provides transverse relaxation rates R2 and R2' separately for each of the spectral components. The method is a combination and extension of the GESFIDE [gradient echo sampling of FID and echo, J. Ma and F. W. Wehrli, J. Magn. Reson. B 111, 61 (1996)] and the multipoint Dixon techniques. It is based on sampling the descending and ascending portions of a Hahn spin echo with a train of gradient echoes which are spaced at one-half of the chemical-shift modulation period. Processing of the complex echo data, involving an automated phase unwrapping algorithm, affords relative amplitudes and transverse relaxation rates of the two spectral components. An additional benefit of the method is its superior signal-to-noise ratio resulting from echo summation. Applications targeted and illustrated involve MRI osteodensitometry of trabecular bone in the presence of varying fractions of hematopoietic and fatty bone marrow.

TI  - Similarity in gallstone formation from 900 kcal/day diets containing 16 g vs 30 g of daily fat: evidence that fat restriction is not the main culprit of cholelithiasis during rapid weight reduction.  
AB  - Diets containing essentially no fat, 1-2 g fat per day, have resulted in cholesterol gallstones. Greater fat may result in less gallbladder stasis. Do gallstones form with greater fat content? We studied 272 moderately obese subjects who had normal gallbladder ultrasonograms. The 900 kcal/day liquid diets contained either 16 g fat (N = 94) or 30 g fat (N = 178) each day for 13 weeks. A second gallbladder ultrasound was performed. Sixteen of 94 (17.0%) of the 16-g fat group developed stones with a weight loss of 18 (+/- 7) kg and a body mass index (BMI) decrease of 6 (+/- 2) kg/m2. Twenty of 178 (11.2%) of the 30-g fat group developed stones (P = 0.18, no difference in stone formation) with similar weight loss of 20 (+/- 7) kg (P = 0.08) and BMI decrease of 7 (+/- 2) kg/m2 (P = 0.04).  Substantial fat for rapid weight-reducing diets resulted in gallstone formation. Since experiments have shown that our higher fat diet, containing 10 g fat per meal, results in maximal gallbladder emptying, cholelithiasis from rapid weight loss may not be solely attributable to gallbladder stasis.

TI  - Caloric restriction reverses hepatic insulin resistance in aging rats by decreasing visceral fat.  
AB  - Hyperinsulinemia and increased visceral/abdominal fat (VF) are common features of human aging. To examine the relationships among VF, peripheral, and hepatic insulin sensitivity, we studied 4- and 18-mo-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 42) fed ad libitum (4 AL and 18 AL) or moderately calorie restricted (18 CR) up to 18 mo of age. Total fat mass (FM) and VF were decreased in 18 CR to approximately one-third of that of 18 AL (P < 0.001), while lean body mass (LBM) was unchanged. Most important, 18 CR had more FM (65+/-6 vs. 45+/-6 g) but less VF (7.8+/-0.6 vs. 12.3+/-3.3 g) compared with 4 AL (P < 0.01 for both). Thus, the effects of variable VF on HIS could be assessed, independent of FM and age. Marked hepatic insulin resistance ensued with aging (18 AL) and CR restored hepatic insulin sensitivity to the levels of young rats, while peripheral insulin sensitivity remained unchanged (by insulin clamp of 18 mU/kg/min). In fact, the rates of insulin infusion required to maintain basal hepatic glucose production in the presence of pancreatic clamp were 0.75+/-0.10, 1.41+/-0.13, and 0.51+/-0.12 mU/kg . min, in 4 AL, 18 AL, and 18 CR, respectively (P < 0.01 between all groups), and in 18 CR rats infused with insulin at similar rates as in the 18 AL (1.4 mU/kg/min) hepatic glucose production was decreased by 32% (P < 0. 005). Furthermore, when 18 CR rats were fed AL for 14 d, VF rapidly and selectively increased and severe hepatic insulin resistance was induced. We propose that in this animal model the age-associated decrease in hepatic (rather than peripheral) insulin action is the major determinant of fasting hyperinsulinemia and that increased visceral adiposity plays the major role in inducing hepatic insulin resistance. Thus, interventions designed to prevent the accumulation of VF are likely to represent an effective mean to improve carbohydrate metabolism in aging.

TI  - Energy, macronutrient, and food intakes in relation to energy compensation in consumers who drink different types of milk.  
AB  - To examine whether total fat intake is actually lower in reduced-fat (low-fat and skim) milk drinkers and whether reduced-fat-milk drinkers compensate for energy intake we compared the intakes of foods, energy, and energy-yielding nutrients in reduced-fat-milk drinkers and whole milk drinkers by using the US Department of Agriculture's 1989-1991 nationwide food intake database, the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. This database represents a national stratified sample population of 15 128 individuals. Of the survey population, approximately one-third consumed whole milk, one-third consumed low-fat milk, one-tenth consumed skim milk, and one-tenth consumed mixed types of milk. The data provided the following information: 1) total fat intake of reduced-fat-milk drinkers is significantly (P < or = 0.05) lower than that of whole milk drinkers; 2) in general, males but not females compensate for energy by increasing their carbohydrate intake; 3) reduced-fat-milk drinkers consume more fruit and vegetables (P < or = 0.05) and less red meat and sweets (P < or = 0.05) than whole milk drinkers; 4) through their reduction in total fat intake, several age groups of skim milk drinkers have achieved the US dietary goal for fat intake, ie, < or = 30% of energy intake from fat; 5) teenagers compensate for energy intake the least of all age groups; and 6) with advancing age, fewer people drink milk and fewer drink whole milk. The data indicate significant sex differences in energy compensation, that reduced-fat-milk drinkers consume significantly (P < or = 0.05) less fat than whole milk drinkers, and that the US dietary goal for fat intake may be practically achieved by consuming reduced-fat foods such as skim milk and limiting intakes of high-fat foods such as red meat.

TI  - Interactions between dietary fat type and xylanase supplementation when rye-based diets are fed to broiler chickens 2. Performance, nutrient digestibility and the fat-soluble vitamin status of livers.  
AB  - 1. The interactions between dietary fat type and xylanase supplementation of rye-based diets were investigated using a 2 x 2 factorial design in which a rye-based diet (610 g rye/kg) was combined with 100 g/kg of soya oil or beef tallow, with or without xylanase supplementation at 3000 IU/kg, and fed to 1-d-old male broilers for 35 d. Growth, nutrient digestibility and AMEN values were determined and the vitamin status of livers assessed at various ages. 2. There were significant interactions between crude fat and xylanase supplementation on the faecal digestibility of crude fat and crude protein.  Fat digestibility was improved by xylanase in both fat type groups but to a greater extent for the tallow diets. However, the effects were found to be significant only for oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. Similarly, protein digestibility and AMEN values were significantly improved by xylanase, but only for the tallow diet. 3. Ileal digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids also were affected by enzyme for both fat type diets, the effect generally being more pronounced for the tallow diet. 4. The deposition of the fat soluble vitamins A and E in livers was significantly increased by xylanase supplementation and was also better for soya oil than for tallow. 5. Xylanase supplementation increased the digestibility of insoluble pentosans whereas for the soluble pentosans the opposite effect was noted. 6. Without xylanase supplementation the tallow-based diet caused high mortality. Liveweight gain and the efficiency of food utilisation were greatest in the soya oil-based, xylanase-supplemented diet, followed by the unsupplemented soya oil-, supplemented tallow- and unsupplemented tallow-based diets.

TI  - Effect of increasing the fat content but not the energy load of a meal on gastro-oesophageal reflux and lower oesophageal sphincter motor function [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although fatty foods are commonly considered detrimental in patients with reflux disease, no objective data exist that substantiate this belief. AIMS: To investigate the effect of fat on gastro-oesophageal reflux and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) motor activity. SUBJECTS: Thirteen healthy subjects and 14 patients with reflux disease. METHODS: Oesophageal pH, LOS, and oesophageal pressures were recorded for 180 minutes after a high fat (52% fat) and a balanced (24% fat) meal (both 3.18 MJ) on two different occasions. Eight controls and seven patients were studied in the recumbent position and the others in the sitting position. RESULTS: The percentage of time at pH less than 4 and the rate of reflux episodes were higher (p < 0.01) in the patients than in the healthy subjects (mean 14.1% versus 1.7% and 4.4/h versus 0.8/h respectively), as was the percentage of transient LOS relaxations associated with reflux (62% versus 32%, p < 0.01). The high fat meal did not increase the rate of reflux episodes nor exposure to oesophageal acid in either group regardless of body posture. The rate of transient LOS relaxations, their association with reflux, and basal LOS pressure were also unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing fat intake does not affect gastro-oesophageal reflux or oesophagogastric competence for at least three hours after a meal.

TI  - Relationship of visual assessments of feeder lamb muscularity to differences in carcass yield traits.  
AB  - We examined the relationship between visual differences in muscle thickness among feeder lambs and subsequent differences in carcass composition. Medium-framed, crossbred feeder lambs (n = 120) were selected at two commercial feedlots to exhibit distinct phenotypic differences in muscularity. The lambs were assigned scores (ranging from 1 to 9; 1 = extremely thin, 5 = average, 9 = extremely thick) for muscle thickness and were sampled serially on d 0, 14, 28, and 42 of the trial. After recording yield grades, one side of each carcass was deboned, and the soft tissues from the entire side were ground, sampled, and analyzed for lipid and moisture content. The opposite side was fabricated into boneless, closely trimmed (.25 cm maximum fat depth) subprimal cuts. When lambs of the same frame size were compared at the same live weight, greater muscle thickness was associated with greater (P < .05) fat-free muscle mass. Correspondingly, thickly muscled lambs produced carcasses of a given weight that had a higher (P < .05) composite yield of lean meat and a lower (P < .05) proportion of trimmable fat compared with carcasses of thinly muscled lambs. When comparisons were made at the same percentage of extractable fat in the carcass, greater muscle thickness was associated with heavier (P < .05) live and carcass weights, increased (P < .05) fat-free muscle mass, and increased (P < .05) weights of trimmed, boneless subprimal cuts. Results suggest that visual assessments of muscle thickness in feeder lambs, as applied in this study, are indicative of commercially important differences in carcass yields of lean meat.

TI  - Relationship between oxidation and conjugation metabolism of skatole in pig liver and concentrations of skatole in fat.  
AB  - High concentrations of skatole in fat of some intact male pigs are a major cause of boar taint. In this study, we investigated the effect of oxidative and conjugative metabolism of skatole in liver on the concentrations of skatole in the fat of intact male pigs. In Trial 1, 18 Yorkshire intact males were equally divided into two treatments with high (mean, .42; SD, .26 ppm) and low (mean, .06; SD, .02 ppm) fat skatole levels. There was an increased rate of skatole metabolism, an increased glucuronidation activity, and a decreased sulfation activity toward 2-naphthol in liver from pigs with high skatole levels (P < .05). In Trial 2, Swedish Yorkshire x F4 European Wild Pig intact males were used. Among skatole metabolites that were produced in incubations with liver microsomes, pro-MII was conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate, and metabolite F-1 was conjugated with glucuronic acid. The rates of formation of various skatole metabolites and conjugation of pro-MII were evaluated for 22 pigs with different levels of cytochrome P4502E1 in the liver. The formation of F-1 and sulfation of pro-MII were negatively correlated with fat skatole levels (r = -.59, and r = -.56, respectively) and were decreased in pigs with high fat skatole levels and low P4502E1 levels (P < .01). The results indicate that oxidation and conjugation reactions of skatole in pig liver have a dramatic effect on skatole levels in the fat. In particular, the formation of F-1 and formation and subsequent sulfation of pro-MII are related to low levels of skatole in the fat, presumably due to rapid metabolic clearance of skatole.

TI  - Body composition analysis of pigs from 5 to 97 kg by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.  
AB  - A total of 231 pigs were anesthetized and then scanned by DXA using a Lunar DPXL instrument. The weight of the pigs ranged from 5 to 97 kg (av. = 37.7 kg). Of the total, 98 pigs were scanned using the pediatric mode and 133 pigs were scanned using the adult mode. After scanning, the pigs were euthanized, the entire body homogenized by grinding, and analyzed chemically for fat, water, protein and total body mineral content. The mean value for the DXA total tissue mass (37.1 kg) was not significantly (P > 0.05, n = 231) different from the mean body weight. The mean DXA value for percent fat was 14.6 and was significantly less (P < 0.05) than the mean value (17.6%) measured by CHEM analysis. The greatest discrepancy occurred in pigs with < 15% body fat. From a prediction equation using the DXA R value [% fat = 493-349(DXA R value)], the DXA estimated percent fat was 18.0%, compared to 17.6% by CHEM analysis (P > 0.05). Using a prediction equation [g protein = -1.062 + 0.22(g DXA lean)], the DXA estimate for body protein content was 17.8%, compared to 17.1% (P < 0.05, n = 131) by CHEM analysis. The DXA estimate for body water content [g water = 508 + 0.74 (g DXA lean)] was 63.8%, compared to 62.6% (P < 0.05, n = 231) by CHEM analysis. The bone mineral content of 83 of the pigs measured by DXA was 2.40%, compared to 2.54% (P < 0.05, n = 83) estimated from CHEM analysis of total body ash [g bone mineral = g total body ash -0.0085(g DXA lean)].

TI  - Antioxidant fortified margarine increases the antioxidant status.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of supplementation with an antioxidant fortified margarine on the body's antioxidant status and on parameters of oxidative damage to lipids. DESIGN: Single blind, placebo controlled trial, two treatment groups balanced for sex, age and Quetelet Index. SETTING: Unilever Research Laboratorium, The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Thirty-one healthy adult volunteers accomplished the study. Volunteers were recruited among inhabitants of the surrounding area of the research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers consumed during the four weeks either 15 g/d of an antioxidant fortified margarine (providing 121 mg vitamin C, 31 mg vitamin E, 2.7 mg alpha-carotene and 5.3 mg beta-carotene) or an ordinary margarine. Fasting blood samples were taken before and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Consumption of the antioxidant fortified margarine significantly increased the levels of the supplied antioxidants in plasma and LDL as compared to the changes found after consumption of the control margarine, with the largest increases found in LDL levels of alpha-carotene (15.5-fold increase, 95% CI: 8.4-27.8-fold) and beta-carotene (4.3-fold increase, 95% CI: 2.2-7.9-fold). This increased antioxidant status in the antioxidant fortified margarine group resulted in a significantly increased total antioxidant activity of LDL and resistance of LDL to oxidation (lag time and rate of oxidation) as compared to baseline but not in comparison to the changes found in the control group. CONCLUSION: Consumption of moderate doses of vitamin E, vitamin C, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, supplied in a full-fat margarine and consumed as part of a normal diet, effectively increases the blood levels of these antioxidants.

TI  - Exercise in dietary restrained women: no effect on energy intake but change in hedonic ratings.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the short-term effects (one day) of exercise and diet composition on appetite control in restrained females. DESIGN: 2x2 repeated measures design, with exercise and lunch type used as the repeated factors. SETTING: The Human Appetite Research Unit at Leeds University Psychology Department. SUBJECTS: Twelve dietary restrained females, normal weight and regular exercisers INTERVENTIONS: A control (rest) and a bout of high intensity exercise (cycling 50 min., 70% VO2 max.) was followed by a free-selection lunch comprising high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) foods. Hunger and heart rate profiles were tracked. Energy Intake (EI) was monitored in the laboratory throughout the day. Post-meal hedonic ratings were completed after lunch and dinner. RESULTS: There was a significant effect of lunch type (HF vs LF) on EI following exercise and rest (P < 0.001) and on total 24 h EI (P < 0.05): EI increased during both HF conditions compared to the LF. A main effect of exercise on tastiness and pleasantness (P < 0.05) of the LF foods served at lunch was found. However, there was no effect of exercise on hunger, weight or energy value of food eaten. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise raises the perceived pleasantness of foods in dietary restrained women, but does not increase the drive to eat within 8 h of the cessation of exercise. The combination of physical activity and a low-fat diet could be used advantageously to control appetite, prevent overconsumption and protect against the development of obesity.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging in a spinal abscess model. Preliminary report.  
AB  - RATIONAL AND OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance (MR) scan technique and lesion detectability were evaluated using a newly developed spinal abscess model in the New Zealand White rabbit. METHODS: To create the lesion, an epidural needle was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance in the lumbar region and advanced to penetrate the ligamentum flavum. Next, polyethylene tubing was fed through the needle into the epidural space. A mixed suspension of Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) and blue polystyrene microspheres then was injected. Lesions were evaluated by MR imaging in four animals at multiple time points (3, 6, and 9 days). Imaging was performed at 1.5 tesla using a surface coil. Precontrast T2-and T1-weighted scans were first obtained. The T1-weighted scans were acquired both with and without fat saturation, and were repeated after intravenous contrast administration. The contrast agent used was gadoteridol (gadolinium HP-DO3A or ProHance) at a dose of 0.3 mmol/kg. RESULTS: On prospective film review, postcontrast scans proved superior for lesion detection. A spinal abscess could be identified postcontrast in all cases, irrespective of the use of fat saturation. The next best imaging technique for lesion detection was the T2-weighted scan, with 5 of 8 lesions noted thereon. Visualization of lesion margins proved to be a primary factor in prospective lesion identification. Region of interest image analysis demonstrated the postcontrast scans to be superior to all precontrast scan techniques for conspicuity of the interface between the abscess and the compressed spinal cord, with these results statistically significant. The lesions were characterized histologically by infiltrates of heterophils into the meninges and outer spinal cord with accompanying mild hemorrhage, fibrin exudation, and bacterial colonies. The lesions in three animals were confirmed to be in the epidural space, with the lesion in one animal in the subdural space. CONCLUSIONS: The current animal model was developed to study spine infection and, specifically, imaging characteristics and lesion detectability on MR. With the increased use of epidural catheters for pain management and the large number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases, epidural infection is becoming an increasingly important clinical problem. Imaging technique, in particular the use of intravenous contrast, is critical for lesion detection and evaluation.

TI  - A comparative study of nutrition and health of mothers in Japan and the Philippines.  
AB  - When comparing nutrition and health among mothers in both Japan and Philippines, it can be concluded that, in regard to nutrition, the results of the total dietary scores for mothers in divided into pregnant and after-delivery stages showed that pregnant Filipino mothers' average are lower than those of pregnant Japanese mothers. Pregnant Filipino mothers and those just after delivery to 4 months had lower average dietary scores than Filipino mothers 5 months and later after delivery. These results are thought to be an important factor in the improvement of health condition and life expectancy of Filipino mothers and their children. In Japanese mothers, such differences were not found. When comparing individual dietary scores and the rate of nutrients consumed to the optimum amounts, significant differences were found among mothers in both countries. Analysis of food diaries of mothers from both countries found that Japanese mothers had average intakes of nutrients such as energy, protein, fat, vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 and were deficient in calcium, iron and vitamin A. Filipino mothers took in average amounts of protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B2 and vitamin C and were deficient in energy, fat and vitamin B1.

TI  - Regional body composition determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Relation to training, sex hormones, and serum lipids in male long-distance runners.  
AB  - This study investigated the regional distribution of fatty and lean tissue in long-distance runners, and the relation to training, sex hormones, and serum lipids. One hundred and twenty lean men (22 elite, 86 recreational runners and 12 non-running controls) aged 32 +/- 8.1 years (mean +/- SD) participated. Body composition (adipose and lean tissue) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the total body and in the abdomen, the arms and the legs. Regional and total body fat correlated inversely with the performance at an incremental treadmill exercise test (-0.61 < r < -0.52, P < 0.0001), and the fat percentage in the abdomen and in the legs was 42% and 36% lower in the elite runners in comparison with the non-running controls. Sex hormonal status and serum lipids were unrelated to training. After multiple regression analysis the most significant determinant of the fat percentage in the legs was the weekly distance run (partial r = -0.40, P < 0.0001), whereas in the abdominal region the free testosterone index also contributed strongly (partial r = 0.39, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, long-distance runners had very low amounts of fatty tissue in the abdomen and in the extremities, and the fat percentages in the abdomen and in the legs were associated with both the training intensity and androgenic activity. Since the abdominal fatty tissue is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, running may have a positive impact on the long-term risk.

TI  - Studies of the anatomy and pathology of the orbit in carcinoma of the maxillary sinus and their impact on preservation of the eye in maxillectomy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The periorbita has been traditionally regarded as the decisive layer whose involvement in carcinoma of maxillary sinus indicates orbital exenteration. Anatomic texts depict that the orbital fat rests on the periorbita. Our experience at surgical dissections has been different. METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent total maxillectomy for advanced (T3-T4) carcinoma of the maxillary sinus with postoperative radiotherapy during a 15-year period between 1981 and 1995. In 11 patients, despite radiologic evidence of orbital invasion, and in 5 patients with infiltration of the periorbita, the eye could be preserved without evidence of recurrence. In 6 patients who in addition underwent orbital exenteration, histopathologic evidence of tumor invasion of the orbit was present in only one surgical specimen. RESULTS: Clinicoanatomic studies have clearly shown the presence of a thin, distinct fascial layer which surrounds the periocular fat and separates it from the periorbita. Neither clinical examination nor imaging could predict orbital invasion with absolute accuracy. Histopathologic examination of the surgical specimens shows that tumor infiltration of the eye is rare. CONCLUSION: Periocular fat is surrounded by a thin fascial layer and is not in direct contact with the periorbita. Intraoperative decision making with respect to preservation of the eye is sometimes essential.

TI  - A potential association between the BM 1500 microsatellite and fat deposition in beef cattle.  
AB  - The obese gene was hypothesized as a candidate gene for fat characteristics in beef cattle. The BM 1500 microsatellite, near the obese gene, was characterized in 158 purebred beef bulls for which carcass trait information was available. Four breeds were included in the analyses-Angus, Charolais, Hereford, and Simmental. Four alleles were found. Lengths were approximately 138, 147, 149, and 140 bp with genotypic frequencies of 0.47, 0.44, 0.09, and 0.003 respectively.  The carcass traits %rib fat, %rib lean, average fat, and grade fat were found to be significantly associated with the different alleles. The presence of the 138-bp allele in the genotype of an animal is correlated with higher levels of fat, whereas the 147-bp allele has the opposite effect. The 149-bp allele was found in low numbers, and a homozygote was never identified. Hereford and Angus bulls had the greatest frequencies of 138-bp alleles (Hereford = 0.57, Angus = 0.59), while Charolais and Simmental had a greater proportion of 147-bp alleles (Charolais = 0.54, Simmental = 0.58). This information may aid cattle producers in selecting cattle for markets that differ in the amount of fat required.

TI  - Relations of body composition to left ventricular geometry and function in children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether body composition and fasting insulin levels explained variation in left ventricular (LV) function and geometry. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two children, 7 to 13 years of age. RESULTS: For LV mass/height the partial correlation (age controlled) with percentage of fat was r = 0.34 (p = 0.008) and the correlation with (Ln)insulin was r = 0.25 (p = 0.051); multiple regression showed that independent proportions of the variance were explained by gender (boys > girls), ethnicity (black > white subjects), and percentage of fat (p = 0.015). Nonnormalized LV mass was correlated (age controlled) with fat-free mass (r = 0.76; p < 0.001), fat mass (r = 0.58; p < 0.001), and (Ln) insulin (r = 0.27; p = 0.0359); multiple regression showed that fat-free mass and fat mass explained independent proportions of the variance. Percentage of fat was correlated (age controlled) with greater relative wall thickness (r = 0.34; p = 0.008) and lower midwall fractional shortening (-0.37; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Body fatness was cross-sectionally associated with levels of LV function and geometry that in adults have been found to lead to morbidity and death. The relationship of fatness to LV mass may be due to the higher insulin concentrations in the fatter children. These cross-sectional results are consistent with the hypothesis that excess fatness may adversely influence cardiovascular health early in life.

TI  - [Chronic dyspepsia. Basic classification based on symptoms and relation to gastrointestinal intolerances and diseases]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: For expedient examination and treatment of chronic dyspepsias initial classification into groups which do not overlap in the main signs is necessary. Such a classification is lacking. The authors used a classification according to bitter or solely acid regurgitations and vomiting and their absence and according to the frequency and occurrence of bowel movements in the course of the day. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a group of 366 subjects (92 men and 274 women) aged 19 to 76 years (mean 52.3 years) readily available data were evaluated statistically (chi square and agreement of two relative frequencies): symptomatology, objective finding, gastrointestinal intolerance (IT). 116 statistically significant relationships were revealed and were divided into four groups: 1, group with bitter manifestations in the morning on fasting and during the night with a relation to milk IT (less with lactose IT) and postprandial diarrhoea. 2. group with bitter manifestations after a meal and in daytime, related to biliary disease and IT of fat. 3. group with solely acid manifestations associated with IT of vinegar, alcohol, gastroaggressive drugs and oligosaccharides and peptic ulceration also in remission. 4. group without regurgitations and vomiting which needed further classification: relatively tolerant of fat but not milk. This group has a characteristic sub-group of subjects with a quiescent stage after cholecystectomy. This sub-group is a "negative" of the properties of group 3. CONCLUSIONS: In the patients four defined groups of dyspepsias were defined associated with manifestations of actual intolerances of foods, savouries and drugs. Three of them are associated with antiperistaltic phenomena in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Effect of elevated blood FFA levels on endurance performance after a single fat meal ingestion.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the effect of elevated blood free fatty acid (FFA) levels on carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation and cycling performance after ingesting a single fat meal (FM). METHODS: Four hours before cycling exercise, nine trained males consumed either a FM (4711 kJ; 30% CHO, 61% fat, and 9% protein) or control meal (CM) (4877 kJ; 58% CHO, 31% fat, and 11% protein). The intensity of exercise employed was 67% of the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for the first 120 min of exercise, followed by an increase to 78% VO2max. RESULTS: The FM ingestion significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) elevated serum FFA levels above those resulting from CM ingestion almost throughout the entire exercise. A significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) lower respiratory exchange ratio in the FM versus the CM trials was observed during the first hour of exercise. This was accompanied by a significantly greater amount of fat oxidized at 20 (P < 0.01) and 60 min (P < 0.05) of FM trials and a significantly smaller amount of CHO oxidized at 20 min (P < 0.05) of FM trials. However, endurance time and work production did not differ between the FM (141 +/- 8 min, 134333 +/- 6049 kg x m (SEM)) and CM (138 +/- 5 min, 131450 +/- 4737 kg x m) trials. Also, there were no significant differences in oxygen consumption, heart rate, and perceived exertion or in glucose, lactate, and triglyceride levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the elevated blood FFA levels after a single FM ingestion reduce CHO oxidation early in exercise, but this decrease in CHO oxidation would not be adequate enough to contribute to an increased endurance.

TI  - Dietary fat consumption and health.  
AB  - Dietary Guidelines have emerged over the past 30 years recommending that Americans limit their consumption of total fat and saturated fat as one way to  educe the risk of a range of chronic diseases. However, a low-fat diet is not a no-fat diet. Dietary fat clearly serves a number of essential functions. For example, maternal energy deficiency, possible exacerbated by very low-fat intakes (< 15% of energy), is one key determinant in the etiology of low birth weight. The debate continues over recommendations for limiting total fat and saturated fatty acid intake in children. Recent evidence indicates that diets with adequate energy providing less than 30% of energy from fat are sufficient to promote normal growth and normal sexual maturation. More attention needs to be devoted to the effect of dietary fat reduction on the nutrient density of children's diets. The association between dietary fat and CHD has been extensively studied. Diets high in saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids increase LDL cholesterol levels, and in turn, the risk of heart disease. The relationship between high-carbohydrate/low-fat diets and CHD is more ambiguous because high-carbohydrate diets induce dyslipidemia in certain individuals. Obesity among adults and children is now of epidemic proportions in the United States. High-fat diets leading to excessive energy intakes are strongly linked to the increasing obesity in the United States. However, the prevalence of obesity has increased during the same time period that dietary fat intake (both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total dietary energy) has decreased. These trends suggest that a concomitant decrease in total dietary energy and modifications of other lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, also need to be emphasized. Obesity is also an independent risk factor for the development of diabetes. The current availability of fat-modified foods offers the potential for dietary fat reduction and treatment of the comorbidities associated with diabetes. However, to date, few studies have documented the effectiveness of fat-modified foods as part of a weight loss regimen or in reduction in CHD risks among individuals with diabetes mellitus. The association between total dietary fat and cancer is still under debate. While there is some evidence demonstrating associations between dietary fat intake and cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon, there are serious methodologic issues, including the difficulty in differentiating the effects of dietary fat independent of total energy intake. Reported total fat and saturated fatty acid intakes as a percentage of total energy have been declining over the past 30 years in the United States. Despite this encouraging trend, the majority of individuals--regardless of age--do not report consuming a diet that meets the levels of fat and saturated fatty acids recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. On a relative basis, saturated fat intake has gone down less than has total fat intake. Individuals of all ages who report consuming a diet with < or = 30% of energy from fat consistently have lower energy intakes. Given the increasing rates of obesity in the United States at an earlier and earlier age, dietary fat reduction may be an effective part of an overall strategy to balance energy consumption with energy needs. In each of the age/gender groups reporting consumption of < or = 30% of energy from fat and less than 10% of energy from saturated fatty acids, fat-modified foods play a more important role in their diets than for people who are consuming higher levels of fat and saturated fat. The data are clear than fat-modified foods make a more significant contribution to diets of consumers with low-fat intakes. While one cannot argue cause and effect from the results presented, the patterns of fat-modified foods/low-fat intakes are consistent. The focus on overall diet quality is often lost in the national obsession with lowering fa

TI  - The effect of dietary protein level on the lysine and arginine requirements of growing chickens.  
AB  - Comparisons were made of the growth and carcass fat responses to dietary lysine and of the lysine requirements of 1-wk-old broiler chickens receiving diets containing either 18, 20, 23 or 25% protein. Similar comparisons were made of the responses elicited by dietary arginine in diets containing 18 or 23% dietary protein. The responses to lysine supplementation and the lysine requirements of chicks receiving 23 or 25% protein diets were similar. In comparing the 18 or 20% to the 23% protein diet, the initial responses of growth and feed efficiency to dietary lysine were augmented, but the maximal weight gain diminished as dietary protein decreased, leading to a decrease in the lysine requirements. The amounts of extractable carcass fat or abdominal fat pad increased as dietary protein was lowered and, in general, were reduced either by lysine or arginine supplementation. Percentage of pectoral muscle increased slightly with dietary arginine and protein supplementation. The results suggest that when total dietary amino acid level is reduced, the requirements for the individual amino acid decrease due to growth retardation resulting from single or multiple amino acid deficiencies. Single amino acid supplementation of low protein diet is more effective in improving the amino acid balance than supplementation of high protein diets, resulting in a further decrease in the requirements.

TI  - Effects of Yucca shidigera extract and soluble protein on performance of cows and concentrations of urea nitrogen in plasma and milk.  
AB  - Twelve multiparous Holstein cows averaging 122 d postpartum were used in a replicated Latin square design with 21-d periods. Cows were fed diets containing either low or high soluble protein supplemented with 0 or 9 g/d of Yucca shidigera extract per cow. Dry matter intake and yields of milk, fat, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and total solids were not affected by treatment. High soluble protein increased percentages of fat and total solids in milk but decreased percentages of crude protein and true protein in milk. Yucca shidigera extract did not affect percentages or yields of milk components, ruminal NH3 N, or urea N in milk or plasma. High soluble protein tended to increase both ruminal pH and concentrations of ruminal NH3 N. Yucca shidigera extract did not affect ruminal pH or NH3 N. High soluble protein increased concentrations of urea N in plasma and milk when both were measured by enzymatic assay, but differences in milk urea N measured by mid infrared reflectance spectroscopy were not significant. Neither Yucca shidigera extract nor increased ruminally undegradable protein was beneficial in this trial when fed to cows milking 30 to 35 kg/d. Concentrations of urea N in milk as measured by mid infrared reflectance spectroscopy were higher than those measured by enzymatic assay, but measurements by mid infrared reflectance spectroscopy were not as sensitive to treatment differences as were measurements by enzymatic assay.

TI  - Fatty acid flow to the duodenum and in milk from cows fed diets that contained fat and nicotinic acid.  
AB  - Four cows fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design; treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial. Treatments were 1) low fat diet, no nicotinic acid; 2) low fat diet, 12 g/d of nicotinic acid; 3) high fat diet, no nicotinic acid; and 4) high fat diet, 12 g/d of nicotinic acid. Cows were fed for ad libitum intake diets consisting of 35% alfalfa silage, 15% corn silage, and either 50% low fat concentrate or 40% high fat concentrate (tallow supplied 6.25% of concentrate) and 10% whole raw soybeans (dry matter basis). Intake of gross energy (104 Mcal/d) was not different among treatments. Ruminal and postruminal digestibility of energy was not altered by fat or nicotinic acid. Fatty acid intake and flow to the duodenum were increased by fat but were not affected by nicotinic acid. For all diets, flows to the duodenum of C16:0, C18:0, total C18, and total fatty acids increased, and flows of C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3 decreased, compared with their intakes. Biohydrogenation of unsaturated C18 was decreased by fat but was not affected by nicotinic acid. Digestibilities of C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, and total fatty acids that flowed to the duodenum were decreased by fat but were not affected by nicotinic acid. The yield of C18:0 in milk was increased, and yields of C6:0 to C16:0 fatty acids were decreased, by fat, but yields were not affected by nicotinic acid.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), comparing both groups with healthy volunteers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University Hospital, Rome, Italy. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients with biopsy-proven inflammatory bowel disease (18 CD; 16 UC) in clinical remission (SCDAI < 3 and Powell-Tuck index < 4) not receiving steroid therapy. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had a clinical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood indicators of inflammation and nutritional status. Body composition was assessed by both anthropometry and bioimpedance and metabolic variables were measured by indirect calorimetry over a 60-90 min period. RESULTS: CD had a lower body weight than both controls (58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 66.4 kg, range 57.0-76.0; P < 0.001) and UC) 58.1 kg, range 41.5-71.0 vs. 69.6 kg, range 50.5-94.0; (P < 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) did not differ between the groups, whilst fat mass was significantly lower in CD than in UC (P < 0.05) and controls (P < 0.001). Normalizing the basal metabolic rate by FFM, a higher value was found in CD compared with UC (143 kJ kg-1) d-(-1), range 97.5-179 vs. 133 kJ kg-1 d-1, range 123-148; P < 0.05) and control subject 143 kj kg-1 d-1, range 97.5-179 vs. 134 kj kg-1 d-1, range 122-162; P < 0.05). The nonprotein respiratory quotient was significantly lower in CD compared to UC 0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.84, range 0.79-0.91; P < 0.01) and controls (0.80, range 0.73-0.84 vs. 0.83, range 0.81-0.87; P < 0.001), with a consequently higher lipid oxidation rate in CD. CONCLUSIONS: CD subjects showed a decreased fat mass and enhanced utilization of lipids compared with UC and controls. These data could be explained by the larger intestinal involvement and considered as a contribution to lipid tissue wasting in CD.

TI  - Comparison of glucose and fat as energy sources in peripheral parenteral nutrition in rats.  
AB  - Glucose is usually chosen as the energy source for total parenteral nutrition. However, the optimal glucose:fat ratio for peripheral parenteral nutrition has not been examined sufficiently. We compared glucose:fat ratios in hypocaloric nutrition. Male SD rats were given hypocaloric parenteral nutrition (approx. 190 kcal/kg/d) for 5 d after laparotomy. The hypocaloric solutions used contained 0, 33, 50, 67 or 100% of the non-protein energy in the form of fat. Body weight change, nitrogen balance, organ weights, and hepatic, splenic and plasma biochemistries were assessed. Body weight increase in the 67 and 100% fat groups was significantly greater than that in the 0% fat group. Nitrogen balance was the same in all groups. Hepatic glycogen content was significantly lower in the 100% fat group than that in the 0% fat group. The weight of epididymal fat deposits was significantly lower in the 0% fat group than in the 50 and 67% fat groups. On the other hand, tissue triglyceride content and plasma lipid levels in the 100% fat group were significantly higher than in the 0% fat group, and were also higher than in the control group. It is suggested that combinations of glucose and fat have sparing effects on body fat and hepatic glycogen. Combinations of glucose and fat as non-protein energy sources were superior to glucose or fat alone for hypocaloric parenteral nutrition.

TI  - Eating patterns and risk of colon cancer [see comments]  
AB  - Colon cancer has been associated with several nutrients and foods. The authors used data from a population-based study conducted in Northern California, Utah, and Minnesota to examine associations between dietary eating patterns and risk of developing colon cancer. Through factor analysis, detailed dietary intake data obtained from 1,993 cases (diagnosed in 1991-1994) and 2,410 controls were grouped into factors that were evaluated for relations with lifestyle characteristics and colon cancer risk. Several dietary patterns emerged. The dietary patterns with the most variation were labeled "Western," "prudent," "high fat/sugar dairy," "substituters," and "drinkers." The "Western" dietary pattern was associated with a higher body mass index and a greater intake of total energy and dietary cholesterol. The "prudent" pattern was associated with higher levels of vigorous leisure time physical activity, smaller body size, and higher intakes of dietary fiber and folate. Persons who had high scores on the "drinker" pattern were also more likely to smoke cigarettes. The "Western" dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in both men and women. The association was strongest among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (for men, odds ratio (OR)=1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-3.15; for women, OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.36) and among men with distal tumors (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.47-3.46). The "prudent" diet was protective, with the strongest associations being observed among people diagnosed prior to age 67 years (men: OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92; women: OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.87); associations with this dietary pattern were also strong among persons with proximal tumors (men: OR=0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.80; women: OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92). Although "substituters" (people who substituted low fat dairy products for high fat dairy products, margarine for butter, poultry for red meat, and whole grains for refined grains) were at reduced risk of colon cancer, the reduction in risk was not statistically significant. These data support the hypothesis that overall dietary intake pattern is associated with colon cancer, and that the dietary pattern associated with the greatest increase in risk is the one which typifies a Western-style diet.

TI  - Tissue stores of individual monounsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer: the EURAMIC study. European Community Multicenter Study on Antioxidants, Myocardial Infarction, and Breast Cancer.  
AB  - The strongest evidence that monunsaturated fat may influence breast cancer risk comes from studies of southern European populations, in whom intake of oleic acid sources, particularly olive oil, appears protective. No previous study has examined the relation of adipose tissue fatty acid content to breast cancer in such a population. We used adipose biopsies with diverse fat intake patterns gathered in 5 European centers, including southern Europe (Malaga, Spain), to test the hypothesis that stores of oleic acid or other monounsaturates are inversely associated with breast cancer.  Gluteal fat aspirates were obtained from 291 postmenopausal incident breast cancer patients and 351 control subjects, frequency-matched for age and catchment area. Logistic regression was used to model breast cancer by monounsaturates, with established risk factors controlled for. Oleic acid showed a strong inverse association with breast cancer in the Spanish center. The odds ratio for the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.58) in Malaga and 1.27 (0.88, 1.85) in all other centers pooled, with a peak at 2.36 (1.01, 5.50) for Zeist. Palmitoleic and myristoleic acids showed evidence of an inverse association outside Spain, and cis-vaccenic acid showed a positive association in 3 centers. These data do not support the hypothesis that increasing tissue stores of oleic acid are protective against breast cancer in non-Spanish populations. This finding implies that the strong protective associations reported for olive oil intake in dietary studies may be due to some other protective components of the oil and not to the direct effect of oleic acid uptake. Alternatively, high olive oil intake may indicate some other protective aspect of the lifestyle of these women.

TI  - Spatial distribution of yolk platelets and fat droplets in oocytes and cleaving embryos of the common frog (Rana temporaria) and toad (Bufo bufo).  
AB  - Animal-vegetal gradients of fat droplets and yolk platelets have been quantitatively determined in mature oocytes and in cleaving embryos in two anuran species Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo using stereological methods. Volume densities Vv which describe properly the amount of nutrients in embryos have been used during the measurements. The embryos till the stage of late blastula are spherical: the spherical form is not distorted even by blastocoel forming eccentrically, in the animal hemisphere. Increased diameters during cleavage, which have been observed in the two species, can be ascribed to growth of the blastocoel and increased number of blastomeres while the quantity of the cytoplasm does not increase. The volume densities of yolk platelets and fat droplets per unit of cytoplasm volume remains constant throughout the cleavage. Volume densities change along the animal-vegetal axis in accordance with the course of the 3rd polynomial depending on the distance of the area under study from the vegetative pole f: y-->Vv, f = ay3 + by2 + cy + d. Parameters of fitting functions a, b, c and d change considerably during development of the embryo, which proves reorganisation of the cytoplasm during cleavage: the most significant changes occur from fertilisation to the four-cell stage and during growth of the blastocoel from morula to late blastula stage. Distortion of the axial symmetry of yolk platelet distribution in embryos occurring after fertilisation is not extensive in the two studied species. The mathematical model of spatial distribution of yolk platelets and fat droplets in oocytes and cleaving embryos in the studied anuran species was proposed using the above data.

TI  - Serum leptin levels in male marathon athletes before and after the marathon run.  
AB  - Leptin is a hormone produced by the adipocytes to regulate food intake and energy expenditure at the hypothalamic level. It is commonly accepted that the main determinants of leptin secretion are the net amount of body fat and the mean size of adipocytes. On the contrary, important vectors of energy flux in the organism, such as food intake and energy expended on exercise, are not thought to be regulators of that secretion. To understand whether leptin is regulated by an acute energy expenditure such as strenuous exercise, 29 male athletes who had trained for marathon running were studied before and after a marathon run and compared with 22 nonobese, age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched sedentary controls. Controls and marathon athletes showed no differences in BMI or fat-free mass. Marathon runners showed a strong reduction in total fat mass (6.2 +/- 0.4 kg; 9.1 +/- 0.5% of body fat) compared with controls (12.3 +/- 0.5 kg; 16.1 +/- 0.5% of body fat; P < 0.05). This difference in body composition was paralleled by a mean serum leptin level that in marathonians (2.9 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L) was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared with that in controls (5.1 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L). It is remarkable that the ratio of leptin per kg body fat, showed a very good agreement between the two groups, 0.40 +/- 0.04 microgram/L.kg for controls and 0.46 +/- 0.03 microgram/L.kg for marathonians. In the two groups, leptin was correlated with both body weight, BMI, and fat mass (P < 0.001). The marathon trajectory was the standard 42.195 km accomplished in an average time of 3 h, 17 min, 7 s, with a calculated energy expenditure of over 2800 Cal. After the marathon run, a water imbalance occurred, with a significant decrease in body weight and an increase in serum albumin. A significant (P < 0.05) reduction in leptin values was observed after the run (2.6 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L) compared with before (2.9 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L), which was more relevant considering the relative hemoconcentration. In conclusion, 1) compared with sedentary subjects, leptin levels are reduced in male marathon runners in parallel with the relevant reduction in total body fat; 2) expressed as a ratio of leptin per kg body fat, no differences were observed between marathonians and controls; and 3) after an energy expenditure of 2800 Cal in the marathon run, a reduction in leptin levels occurred. Strong changes in energy expenditure may regulate serum leptin levels in man.

TI  - Genetic sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil and sensory responses to sugar and fat mixtures.  
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that genetic sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) is associated with greater sensitivity to sugar and fat in foods. Subjects were 118 young women from different ethnic backgrounds, mean age 26.9 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 23.4. The women were classified as nontasters (n = 39), medium tasters (n = 48), or supertasters (n = 31) of PROP. Nontasters of PROP had thresholds of 1.8 x 10(-4) mol/L PROP or greater, whereas tasters had thresholds below 1.0 x 10(-4) mol/L PROP. PROP tasters were divided into medium tasters and supertasters, based on the ratio of intensity ratings of suprathreshold PROP solutions relative to NaCl solutions. Supertasters were defined as those with PROP/NaCl ratios of 1.90 or more. The pattern of sensory responses to sweetened dairy products of varying sugar and fat contents closely replicated data obtained in other studies. Genetic sensitivity to PROP was not associated with enhanced perception or altered hedonic response profiles for this range of 15 sugar/fat mixtures. Separating subjects into "likers" and "dislikers" of sweetened dairy products failed to reveal significant links to PROP taster status in this all-female sample.

TI  - Relative contributions of subcutaneous and intermuscular fat to yields and predictability of retail product, fat trim, and bone in beef carcasses.  
AB  - Carcass data from one side of 610 steers born from 1988 to 1990 in Cycle IV of the Germ Plasm Evaluation research program were analyzed to develop means for carcass traits and retail product percentages at two fat trim levels (.76 and .00 cm) by yield grade categories. Weights of subcutaneous (s.c.) fat and intermuscular (i.e.m.) fat were recorded separately at each trim level. Quadratic regression curves were plotted for percentages of roast and steak meat (R&S), retail product (RP), and fat trim components relative to incremental changes in USDA yield grade. Prediction equations were developed on a randomly chosen half of the 610 carcasses to predict weights and percentages of R&S, RP, and fat trim using carcass traits obtained at the time of USDA grading and then tested on the remaining half of the carcasses. In addition, prediction equations were developed using s.c. and i.e.m. fat plus carcass traits to evaluate the contribution of each to carcass fabrication yields. Percentage of RP, trimmed to either .76 cm or .00 cm of fat, decreased by an average of 3.5% for each full yield grade increase. Trimming to .00 cm of fat resulted in about 5.3% less RP compared to trimming to .76 cm. A prediction equation for percentage of RP trimmed to .00 cm using adjusted fat thickness, carcass weight, longissimus muscle area, and percentage of kidney knob had an R2 value of .54. The variations in percentage of R&S and percentage of RP at both trim levels were reduced by removing s.c. fat trimmed to .76 cm; however, considerable variation still existed. Subcutaneous fat expressed as a percentage of the sum of i.e.m. and s.c. fat increased as yield grade increased, but the percentage of i.e.m. fat was higher than the percentage of s.c. fat for all yield grades. On the basis of partial correlation coefficients, i.e.m. fat was approximately twice as important as s.c. fat in accounting for variations in fabrication yields.

TI  - Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of temporomandibular disorders: improved lesion detection of the posterior disk attachment on T1-weighted images obtained with fat suppression.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for improved lesion detection in the posterior disk attachment and its surrounding tissue in temporomandibular disorders when gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging performed with fat suppression is used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients underwent MR imaging with conventional T1- and T2-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed spin-echo imaging sequences. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of the contrast enhancement of each type of imaging were also performed. RESULTS: The contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging sequence had several advantages over the other imaging techniques in detecting abnormalities of the posterior disk attachment and in detecting bone marrow lesions in the mandibular condyle. The most significant advantage was better enhancement of lesion conspicuity. The diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed imaging was 77% versus 70% for conventional contrast-enhanced imaging. The kappa value for interobserver agreement was .95 for contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed imaging and .72 for conventional contrast-enhanced imaging. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted spin-echo MR imaging is a valuable technique for visualizing the extent and degree of lesions in the posterior disk attachment and bone marrow lesions in the mandibular condyle.

TI  - Genetic variation and prediction of additive and nonadditive genetic effects for six carcass traits in an Angus-Brahman multibreed herd.  
AB  - Estimates of covariances and sire expected progeny differences of additive and nonadditive genetic effects for six carcass traits were obtained using records from 486 straightbred and crossbred steers from 121 sires born between 1989 and 1995 in the Angus-Brahman multibreed herd of the University of Florida. Steers were slaughtered at a similar carcass composition end point. Covariances were estimated by REML procedures, using a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm applied to multibreed populations. Straightbred and crossbred estimates of heritabilities and additive genetic correlations were within ranges found in the literature for steers slaughtered on an age- or weight-constant basis for hot carcass weight, longissimus muscle area, and shear force but equal to or less than the lower bound of these ranges for fat-related traits. Maximum values of interactibilities (i.e., ratios of nonadditive variances to phenotypic variances in the F1) and nonadditive genetic correlations were smaller than heritabilities and additive genetic correlations in straightbreds and crossbred groups. Sire additive and total direct genetic predictions for longissimus muscle area, marbling, and shear force tended to decrease with the fraction of Brahman alleles, whereas those for hot carcass weight and fat thickness over the longissimus were higher, and those for kidney fat were lower in straightbreds and F1 than in other crossbred groups. Nonadditive genetic predictions were similar across sire groups of all Angus and Brahman fractions. These results suggest that slaughtering steers on a similar carcass composition basis reduces variability of fat-related traits while retaining variability for non-fat-related traits comparable to slaughtering steers on a similar age or weight basis. Selection for carcass traits within desirable (narrow) ranges and slaughter of steers at similar compositional end point seems to be a good combination to help produce meat products of consistent quality.

TI  - Effect of visceral fat accumulation on uric acid metabolism in male obese subjects: visceral fat obesity is linked more closely to overproduction of uric acid than subcutaneous fat obesity.  
AB  - We investigated the relationship between uric acid (UA) metabolism and fat distribution in 36 obese men with a mean +/- SD age of 38 +/- 16 years and mean body-mass index (BMI) of 34 +/- 4 kg/m2. Subjects were divided into two groups: subcutaneous fat obesity (SFO) and visceral fat obesity (VFO), according to their abdominal fat distribution based on the results of computed tomography (CT). SFO was defined as having a ratio of visceral fat area (VFA) to subcutaneous fat area (V/S) of less than 0.4, and VFO was defined as having a V/S ratio > or = 0.4. The levels of serum total cholesterol (T-Chol), triglyceride (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and the diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were significantly higher in the VFO group than in the SFO group. Serum UA levels were much higher in both the SFO and VFO groups than in the non-obese control group (492 +/- 107 and 474 +/- 90 v 309 +/- 48 micromol/L, respectively). The 24-hour urinary urate excretion (u-UA24h) and the UA clearance (Cua) to creatinine clearance (Ccr) ratio were significantly higher in the VFO group than in the SFO group (3.75 +/- 1.43 v 2.69 +/- 1.12 mmol/d, P < .05; and 5.9% +/- 2.0% v 3.6% +/- 1.7%, P < .001, respectively). The frequency of hyperuricemia was markedly higher in both the SFO and VFO groups compared with the control group (71% and 73% v 0%, respectively). Although the high serum UA level seemed to be related to low u-UA24h in 80% of SFO subjects with hyperuricemia, this was the case in only 10% of VFO subjects. While 44% of VFO subjects with hyperuricemia were designated as an overproduction type. These results suggest that the mechanism of hyperuricemia in obesity may be affected by the difference in body fat distribution and that the assessment of body fat distribution and types of hyperuricemia is crucial for the treatment of obese patients with hyperuricemia.

TI  - Impact of adopting lower-fat food choices on nutrient intake of American children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall nutrient intake of American children (ages 2 to 19) who exclusively use skim milk instead of 1%, 2%, or whole milk; lean meats instead of higher-fat meats; or fat-modified products instead of full-fat products. STUDY DESIGN: A unique sorting procedure was used to categorize respondents to the 1989-1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals according to reported use or nonuse of certain fat-reduction strategies. Differences in intake of 23 macronutrients and micronutrients, as well as energy, by exclusive users, mixed users, and nonusers of each strategy were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance with Scheffe's test. The number of fat-reduction strategies used by the children as well as demographic characteristics also were analyzed. RESULTS: Only a small number of children qualified as exclusive users of skim milk (3%), lean meats (2%), and fat-modified products (1%). Energy intakes for all children were below 100% of the recommended dietary allowance. However, children (n = 85) who used skim milk exclusively in place of higher-fat milks closely approximated the current dietary recommendations (30% energy from fat, less than 10% from saturated fat, and less than 300 mg cholesterol) while maintaining adequate micronutrient intake and without significantly impacting energy. Children (n = 52) who used lean meats in place of higher-fat meats achieved the guideline for total fat; however, energy intake was 70% of the recommended dietary allowance and vitamin E was 63%. Children (n = 20) who use only fat-modified versions of cheese, salad dressing, cake, pudding, and yogurt made no significant impact on their energy, fat, or micronutrient intake. Of the 3299 children in the data set, only 3 qualified as users of two fat-reduction strategies and none qualified as users of all three strategies. Exclusive users of skim milk, lean meat, or fat-modified products were more likely to be female, white, and live in families with higher incomes. Those using skim milk or lean meat exclusively also were more likely to be older, whereas those exclusively using fat-modified products were younger. Furthermore, those using skim milk or fat-modified products exclusively were more likely to live in households where the head had more years of education, whereas those exclusively using lean meats were from households headed by those with slightly less years of education. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent limitations of population-based food surveys (including issues of underreporting, lack of biological markers and accurate anthropometric measures, and limited nutrient databases), these results provide insight into the rate of use of certain lower-fat food choices by children and suggest exclusive use can facilitate achievement of contemporary dietary recommendations. The impact of using these fat-reduction strategies on children's overall nutrient intake differs depending on the strategy used. Use of skim milk is an economical single-food strategy that facilitates achievement of contemporary dietary guidelines while maintaining nutrient adequacy. Professional guidance is recommended for children who exclusively use lean meats to assure adequate intake of energy and vitamin E. The impact of fat-modified products needs to be monitored c

One-gram samples of ground round (4% fat), hamburger (24% fat), and commercial pork sausage (38%fat) were cooked in a controlled-temperature waterbath at 65, 68.3 and 71 degrees C. Chilled samples were immersed in direct contact with the cooking water; the test samples were removed every 15 s and immediately immersed in an ice-water bath (O to 1 degrees C) to quick-chill the samples to prevent temperature over-run. Samples retained high (HMB value 20+, over range) CAT activity through 90, 60, and 45 s at 65, 68.3, and 71 degrees C, respectively, before showing rapid activity decreases. Four USDA-FSIS approved meat patty heating processes (66.1 degrees C, 41 s; 67.2 degrees C, 26 s; 68.3 degrees C, 16 s; and 69.4 degrees C, 10 s) were analyzed for CAT activity in meat frozen prior to cooking was slightly lower (P < 0.05) than in degrees C meat. CAT activity decreased (P < 0.05) among meat treated at 66.1 degrees C for 41 s, at 67.2 degrees C for 26 s, and at 68.3 degrees C for 16 s, but the treatment at 68.3 degrees C for 16 s was not different (P < 0.05) from that at 69.4 degrees C for 10 s. These results show this rapid (20 to 25 min) CAT activity test could be used to establish activity values at specific end-point temperatures for model heat-processed ground beef or sausage products and may be useful to USDA FSIS process inspectors and food processors in quality assurance and HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) programs for thermal input verification.

TI  - Decontaminating beef for Escherichia coli O157:H7.  
AB  - Beef lean, fat, and connective tissues were inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 before and after a prewashing procedure to compare the efficacy of prewashing and no prewashing on bacterial adherence and, consequently, on the removal of bacteria from the inoculated surfaces. Prewashing consisted of spraying tissues with tap water before inoculation. Final washing with disinfectant solutions compared the efficacy of several chemicals for the removal or destruction of E. coli O157:H7. The results showed that prewashing was very effective in reducing the numbers of bacterial cells on beef tissues, mainly lean tissue, in the control samples which received final washing with water. An opposite effect of prewashing was observed when disinfectant solutions were used for final washing; this may be due to dilution by water carried on the tissues after prewashing. The efficacy of chemicals was dependent on the type of exposed tissue. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was more efficient in the removal of E. coli O157:H7 from connective tissues, with reductions greater than 4 log CFU/cm2, compared to a normally washed control (P < 0.01). Chlorhexidine (0.1%) was very efficient on fat and lean tissues, causing reductions over 5 log CFU/cm2 on not prewashed fat and lean tissues, compared to the control (P < 0.01). Acetic acid (5%) was the least effective, decreasing the number of CFU by under 1 log/cm2 as compared to the control; and no statistically significant difference was found among tissues, even though the removal of bacteria seemed less in lean tissue compared to fat or connective tissues.

TI  - Serum leptin, food intake and preferences for sugar and fat in obese women.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of leptin with food intake and preferences for sugar and fat in obese humans. METHOD: Food intake and preferences for sugar and fat were measured in 35 obese women by a four-day food record and three hedonic tests, respectively. RESULTS: High fasting serum leptin concentration adjusted for body fat mass and dietary underreporting was associated with low dietary energy and fat intakes. In addition, trends towards lower preference for chocolate as well as for the taste of high-fat, low-sugar mixture were observed in those with higher leptin concentration. CONCLUSION: High serum leptin concentration could be associated in obese women with lower dietary energy and fat intakes, and possibly with the lower preference for fat. These findings need to be verified in further human studies.

TI  - A comparison of fat intake of normal weight, moderately obese and severely obese subjects.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excess dietary fat has been implicated in the etiology of obesity. METHODS: This study examined the fat intake of three weight groups, normal (20.0 < or = BMI < or = 27.0), moderately obese (27.1 < or = BMI < or = 39.9) and severely obese (BMI > or = 40.0). Each group contained 50 subjects. Detailed 3-day food records were used to gather the nutritional data. Anthropometric and sociodemographic information was also collected. RESULTS: Overall fat intake was 89 +/- 42 g/day or 37 +/- 10% of total energy. Total fat (g/1000 kcalories) intake was found to be significantly higher in the obese groups (p < 0.05). Subjects in the moderately and severely obese groups consumed significantly more fat and cholesterol and less carbohydrate than did normal weight subjects. Compared to the normal weight subjects, obese subjects also had higher intakes of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (as a percentage of dietary energy). There was no difference in energy or protein intake, and P/S ratio among the three groups. BMI was strongly positively correlated with total fat, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, and protein intake (as g/day only), and negatively correlated with carbohydrate intake and the CHO/FAT ratio. Energy intake was not significantly associated with BMI. CONCLUSION: A high fat diet may promote obesity, independently of its calorie contribution.

TI  - Functional properties of leptin receptor isoforms containing the gln-->pro extracellular domain mutation of the fatty rat [see comments]  
AB  - Mutations of the leptin receptor have been found to cause obesity in rodents. The fa mutation that is responsible for obesity in Zucker rats is a missense mutation (269 gln-->pro) in the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor. We have characterized the effects of this mutation on the two major isoforms of the leptin receptor, Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra, by studying cell-surface expression, leptin binding affinity, signaling capacity, and receptor-mediated internalization and degradation of leptin in transfected mammalian cell lines. Both Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) and Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) have decreased cell-surface expression and decreased leptin binding affinity. Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) was shown to have defective signaling to the JAK-STAT pathway and markedly diminished ability to activate transcription of the egr-1 promoter. Constitutive ligand-independent activation of Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) was observed for activation of egr-1-luc but only under conditions when JAK2 was coexpressed with Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro), Finally, Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) has an increased ability to internalize leptin but is less efficient at degrading leptin, as compared with Ob-Ra. In conclusion, both Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) and Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) have multiple functional defects.

TI  - [Peri-sudoral lipoma]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We identified in our files 11 cases of a new variant of the superficial lipoma recently described by Hitchcock, Hurt and Santa Cruz, characterized by the presence of eccrine sweat glands and denominated "adenolipoma of the skin". PATIENTS AND METHOD: We examined 1,742 skin lesions registered in the Laboratory for Skin Histopathology from January 1989 to August 1996. These lesions were 397 lipomas, 1,325 skin tags (acrochordons) of which 120 with a fatty stroma and 20 connective tissue hamartomas of which 7 superficial lipomatous hamartomas. Among these lesions we looked for those corresponding to the prime description of the cutaneous adenolipoma. RESULTS: We identified 11 cases of adenolipoma, i.e. a frequency of 0.65 p. 100 for the whole examined lesions and 2 p.100 among the 524 lesions with a fatty component (lipomas, lipomatous hamartomas and fibrolipomas). The mean age of the patients was 50 years and the sex-ratio F/M 1.75. The lesions were localized on the lower limbs (7 cases), especially on the thighs (4 cases), on the trunk (3 cases) and on the shoulder (1 case). DISCUSSION: The adenolipoma is quite different from the common cutaneous lipomas. It develops within the dermis or the fatty layer. It is a solitary lipoma most often localized on the proximal parts of the limbs, especially on the thighs. Histologically it presents as a lobulated and capsulated tumor where eccrine sweat glands and ducts are present inside the fatty lobules. Apparently the adenolipoma originates from the fat pad around the sweat coils without proliferation of the sweat glands or ducts; this entity should therefore be denominated "perisudoral lipoma" rather than adenolipoma. It has to be differentiated from the skin tags with a fatty stroma (fibrolipomas) and from the superficial lipomatous hamartomas.

TI  - Effects of conjugated linoleic acid on body fat and energy metabolism in the mouse.  
AB  - Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a naturally occurring group of dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid found in the fat of beef and other ruminants. CLA is reported to have effects on both tumor development and body fat in animal models. To further characterize the metabolic effects of CLA, male AKR/J mice were fed a high-fat (45 kcal%) or low-fat (15 kcal%) diet with or without CLA (2.46 mg/kcal; 1.2 and 1.0% by weight in high- and low-fat diets, respectively) for 6 wk. CLA significantly reduced energy intake, growth rate, adipose depot weight, and carcass lipid and protein content independent of diet composition. Overall, the reduction of adipose depot weight ranged from 43 to 88%, with the retroperitoneal depot most sensitive to CLA. CLA significantly increased metabolic rate and decreased the nighttime respiratory quotient. These findings demonstrate that CLA reduces body fat by several mechanisms, including a reduced energy intake, increased metabolic rate, and a shift in the nocturnal fuel mix.

TI  - The route of estrogen replacement therapy confers divergent effects on substrate oxidation and body composition in postmenopausal women.  
AB  - The route of estrogen replacement therapy has a major impact on the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis. Estrogen administration by the oral, but not the transdermal route, reduces IGF-I and increases GH levels in postmenopausal women. To investigate whether these perturbations have metabolic consequences, we compared the effects of 24 wk each of oral (Premarin 1.25 mg) and transdermal (Estraderm 100TTS) estrogen on energy metabolism and body composition in 18 postmenopausal women in an open-label randomized crossover study. Energy expenditure, lipid oxidation (lipid(ox)), and carbohydrate oxidation (CHOox) were measured by indirect calorimetry in the fasted and fed state before and after 2 and 6 mon treatment. Lean body mass, fat mass, and total body bone mineral density were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry before and after 6 mon treatment. Mean (+/-SE) Luteinizing hormone levels fell to comparable levels during oral and transdermal estrogen, and bone mineral density was significantly increased by both treatments. Mean IGF-I was significantly lower during oral estrogen (77+/-7 versus 97+/-7 microg/liter, P < 0.05) treatment. Lipid(ox) 30-60 min after a standardized meal was significantly lower (36+/-5 versus 54+/-5 mg/min, P < 0.01) and CHOox higher (147+/-13 versus 109+/-12 mg/min, P < 0.05) with oral compared with transdermal estrogen. Oral estrogen resulted in a 1.2+/-0.5 kg (P < 0.05) increase in fat mass and a 1.2+/-0.4 kg (P < 0.01) decrease in lean mass compared with transdermal estrogen. Lean body mass (0.4+/-0.2 kg) and fat mass (0. 1+/-0.4 kg) did not change significantly during transdermal estrogen. In summary, when compared with the transdermal route, oral estrogen reduces lipid(ox), increases fat mass, and reduces lean body mass. The route of estrogen therapy confers distinct and divergent effects on substrate oxidation and body composition. The suppression of lipidox during oral estrogen therapy may increase fat mass although the fall in IGF-I may lead to a loss of lean body mass. The route-dependent changes in body composition observed during estrogen replacement therapy may have important implications for postmenopausal health.

TI  - Gender differences in leptin levels during puberty are related to the subcutaneous fat depot and sex steroids.  
AB  - Little is known about the influence of adiposity and hormone release on leptin levels in children and adolescents. We utilized criterion methods to examine the relationships among sex steroids, body composition (4 compartment), abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat (magnetic resonance imagery), total subcutaneous fat (sum of 9 skinfolds), energy expenditure (doubly labeled water), aerobic fitness, and serum leptin levels in prepubertal and pubertal boys (n = 16; n = 13) and girls (n = 12; n = 15). The sum of skinfolds accounted for more variance in leptin levels of all girls [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.70, P < 0.001] and all boys (R2 = 0.60, P < 0.001) than the total fat mass (girls, R2 = 0.52, P < 0.001; boys, R2 = 0.23, P < 0.001). Total energy expenditure, corrected for the influence of fat-free mass, correlated inversely with leptin (R2 = 0.18, P = 0.02). Gender differences in leptin disappeared when corrected for sex steroid levels or the combination of adiposity and energy expenditure. In multiple regression, the sum of skinfolds and free testosterone and estrogen levels accounted for 74% of the variance in leptin levels. We conclude that serum leptin levels are positively related to subcutaneous adiposity but negatively related to androgen levels. Energy expenditure may be negatively related to leptin levels by reduction of the adiposity, or a common genetic factor may influence both the activity and serum leptin levels.

TI  - Validation of predictive equations for use of deuterium oxide dilution to determine body composition of dogs.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate equations predicting body composition of dogs, using deuterium oxide dilution. ANIMALS: 38 female and 37 male dogs selected by defined body weight and body condition criteria. PROCEDURE: Measured equilibrated deuterium concentration in serum after i.v. administration of isotope was used to determine isotope space and predict body water, fat, nitrogen, and ash contents determined from analysis of homogenized carcass. Equations predicting body composition were derived, using regression analysis, and were validated, using data-splitting techniques. RESULTS: Deuterium space (in kilograms) overestimated kilograms of body water content by mean 21.8% +/- SD of 4.18%. Regression equations were derived and validated to predict kilograms of body water and ash from kilograms of deuterium space, and proportion of body water, fat, nitrogen, and ash from proportion of deuterium space. Coefficients of determination (r2) and means of standard errors of estimating new values (SEE) were, respectively, 0.993 and 0.4 kg for body water content, and 0.942 and 0.08 kg for ash content. For proportions, SEE were 2.0, 2.7, 0.1, and 0.4% for body water, fat, nitrogen, and ash, respectively. Two factors, time for isotope equilibration and whether samples were processed by vacuum sublimation, improved SEE for proportion of body water from 2.0 to 1.3% and of fat from 2.7 to 1.8%. Equations predicting absolute quantities of fat and nitrogen could be derived but not validated. CONCLUSIONS: Deuterium dilution can be used to predict body composition of dogs with precision equal to that determined for other species.

TI  - Energy balance, metabolic hormones, and early postpartum follicular development in dairy cows fed prilled lipid.  
AB  - The objectives of this study were to relate energy balance and metabolic hormones during the early postpartum period in dairy cows with dominant follicle development before first ovulation and to evaluate the effects of prilled lipid on follicular development during the first follicular wave after parturition and the postpartum anovulatory interval. At parturition, 42 cows received a control diet (4.8% fat) or a diet supplemented with prilled fatty acids (7.0% fat). Energy balance was determined daily. Ovarian follicular development was monitored by ultrasonography, and blood plasma or serum was analyzed for estradiol, progesterone, and metabolic hormones. Dry matter intake was lower in cows supplemented with dietary lipids during the first 4 wk of lactation, but energy intake, energy balance, and the postpartum anovulatory interval were similar between diets. A wave of follicular development occurred in all cows during the 2nd wk postpartum, and 50% of all cows ovulated their first dominant follicle. Numbers of follicles that were 3 to 5 mm, 6 to 9 mm, and 10 to 15 mm on d 8 postpartum were similar between diets and unrelated to energy balance or metabolic hormones. Diameter of the dominant follicle during d 8 to 14 postpartum and maximum diameter of the first-wave ovulatory follicle did not differ between diets. Cows with nonovulatory first-wave dominant follicles had lower mean plasma concentrations of estradiol during d 8 to 14 postpartum, a longer interval to the day of the energy balance nadir, lower serum concentrations of IGF-I, and higher 4% FCM yield than did cows with ovulatory first-wave dominant follicles. Serum IGF-I during d 1 to 13 was positively correlated with plasma estradiol during d 8 to 14 postpartum. Possibly because of reductions in dry matter intake, the consumption of prilled lipid by dairy cows during early lactation may be ineffective in altering energy balance, follicular development, and the postpartum anovulatory interval. Ovulation failure of dominant follicles early in the postpartum period is associated with greater production of 4% fat-corrected milk, a delayed energy balance nadir, and reduced concentrations of peripheral IGF-I.

TI  - Supplemental fat and nicotinic acid for Holstein cows during an entire lactation.  
AB  - The objectives of this experiment were to determine long-term responses to supplemental fat (from whole soybeans and liquid animal fat) and to determine whether the supplementation of nicotinic acid would enhance milk protein content or yield. From wk 4 through 43 postpartum, 44 multiparous Holstein cows (10 to 12 per treatment) were assigned to one of four dietary treatments: 1) control, 2) control plus 12 g/d of nicotinic acid, 3) supplemental fat, and 4) supplemental fat plus 12 g/d of nicotinic acid. The dry matter intake of cows did not differ among dietary treatments. Yields of milk, solids-corrected milk, and 3.5% fat-corrected milk were increased by nicotinic acid; the yield of fat-corrected milk during wk 4 to 25 was increased by supplemental fat. Contents of crude protein (CP) and true protein in milk were less for cows fed diets supplemented with fat or nicotinic acid; casein content was decreased by nicotinic acid. Intake of net energy for lactation was greater for cows fed supplemental fat; energy balance was greater during wk 4 to 25 for cows fed diets supplemented with fat. Body condition score and body weight were less when nicotinic acid was added to the control diet than when it was added to the diet supplemented with fat. Supplemental fat increased the concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in plasma; nicotinic acid increased NEFA when it was added to the control diet but decreased NEFA when it was added to the diet supplemented with fat. Nicotinic acid did not prevent the decrease in milk CP content that was induced by dietary fat, but it did increase milk yield and tended to increase the yield of milk CP.

TI  - Interactions between dietary fat type and xylanase supplementation when rye-based diets are fed to broiler chickens. 1. Physico-chemical chyme features.  
AB  - 1. The interactions between fat type and xylanase supplementation of rye-based diets were investigated using a 2 x 2 factorial design in which a rye-based diet (610 g rye/kg) was combined with 100 g/kg of soya oil or beef tallow, with and without xylanase supplementation at 3000 IU/kg, and fed to 1-d-old male broilers. Food passage time, viscosity of digesta supernatant, xylanase activity and pH in different segments of the digestive tract were examined. 2. Food passage throughout the digestive tract was accelerated by enzyme addition regardless of fat type. The time taken for 50% of the marker to be excreted was reduced from 8.4 to 6.7 h in animals receiving the rye-soya oil diets and from 8.0 to 6.9 h with the rye-tallow diets. 3. Viscosity in the supernatant of the jejunal and ileal digesta was markedly decreased after enzyme addition. Viscosities were generally higher in the ileal than in the jejunal supernatant, and fell as the birds aged from 14 to 28 d. The effect of enzyme was also reduced in older chicks. There was not a clear effect of the fat source on viscosity. 4. Xylanase activity was still found at the end of the ileum in digesta of birds fed on the enzyme-supplemented diets but not in control animals. Xylanase activity was also detected in the caeca of all groups. 5. Significantly lower pH values were found in tallow-fed birds in some segments of the digestive tract. A significant increase in pH after enzyme addition was detected in the proximal ileum; this was independent of fat source.
