TI  - Life-saving muscle flaps in tracheobronchial dehiscence following resection or trauma.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the presence of acute inflammation and necrosis of the wall, tracheo-bronchial defects are difficult to manage. The absence of adequate vascularization and the contaminated area prevent successful direct re-suturing. METHODS: In order to restore a sufficient blood supply we used a pedicled latissimus dorsi or a pectoralis major flap that was entered into the thorax after a 10-cm resection of the second rib. A portion of the muscle was fitted into the tracheo/bronchial defect by reinforced sutures. The remaining muscle was sutured to the tissue surrounding the defect. This method was applied in various septic conditions: Bronchial defects; complete dehiscence of the right (n = 6) or left (n = 1) main bronchus at the carinal level following resection for lung cancer (n = 4) or for tuberculous (n = 2) on nontuberculous pleuropneumonia (n = 1). Tracheal defects; (1) destruction of one third of the tracheal circumference involving the cricoid down to the fourth ring following tracheotomy in presence of a septic sternum after intrathoracic goiter and Bechterew's disease; (2) 30% dehiscence of the anastomosis and septic sternum following tracheal resection; (3) Mediastinitis involving tracheal and esophageal wall following a 7 cm long iatrogenous laceration of the intrathoracic trachea. RESULTS: In one case the latissimus dorsi developed venous stasis on day 2 and was replaced by the pectoralis major muscle which showed uneventful healing. In all other patients the muscle flap resulted in an uneventful closure of the defect and recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Large, well vascularized, pedicled muscle flaps ensure a safe closure of tracheo-bronchial defects or dehiscences even in presence of gross necrosis and sepsis.

TI  - [Development of a gait trainer with regulated servo-drive for rehabilitation of locomotor disabled patients]  
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a new gait trainer for the rehabilitation of non-ambulatory patients. For the simulation of the gait phase, we used a commercially available fitness trainer (Fast Track) with two foot plates moving in an alternating fashion and connected to a servo-controlled propulsion system providing the necessary support for the movement depending on the patient's impairment level. To compensate deficient equilibrium reflexes, the patient was suspended in a harness capable of supporting some of his/her weight. Video analysis of gait and the kinesiological EMG were used to assess the pattern of movement and the corresponding muscle activity, which were then evaluated in healthy subjects, spinal cord injured and stroke patients and compared with walking on the flat or on a treadmill. Walking on the gait trainer was characterised by a symmetrical, sinusoidal movement of lower amplitude than in normal gait. The EMG showed a low activity of the tibialis anterior muscle, while the antigravity muscles were clearly activated by the gait trainer during the stance phase. In summary, the new gait trainer generates a symmetrical gait-like movement, promoting weight acceptance in the stance phase, which is important for the restoration of walking ability.

TI  - Subcutaneous abdominal fat and thigh muscle composition predict insulin sensitivity independently of visceral fat.  
AB  - Whether visceral adipose tissue has a uniquely powerful association with insulin resistance or whether subcutaneous abdominal fat shares this link has generated controversy in the area of body composition and insulin sensitivity. An additional issue is the potential role of fat deposition within skeletal muscle and the relationship with insulin resistance. To address these matters, the current study was undertaken to measure body composition, aerobic fitness, and insulin sensitivity within a cohort of sedentary healthy men (n = 26) and women (n = 28). The subjects, who ranged from lean to obese (BMI 19.6-41.0 kg/m2), underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to measure fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM), computed tomography to measure cross-sectional abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, and computed tomography (CT) of mid-thigh to measure muscle cross-sectional area, muscle attenuation, and subcutaneous fat. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the glucose clamp technique (40 mU.m-2.min-1), in conjunction with [3-3H]glucose isotope dilution. Maximal aerobic power (VO2max) was determined using an incremental cycling test. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) ranged from 3.03 to 16.83 mg.min-1.kg-1 FFM. Rd was negatively correlated with FM (r = -0.58), visceral fat (r = -0.52), subcutaneous abdominal fat (r = -0.61), and thigh fat (r = -0.38) and positively correlated with muscle attenuation (r = 0.48) and VO2max (r = 0.26, P < 0.05). In addition to manifesting the strongest simple correlation with insulin sensitivity, in stepwise multiple regression, subcutaneous abdominal fat retained significance after adjusting for visceral fat, while the converse was not found. Muscle attenuation contributed independent significance to multiple regression models of body composition and insulin sensitivity, and in analysis of obese subjects, muscle attenuation was the strongest single correlate of insulin resistance. In summary, as a component of central adiposity, subcutaneous abdominal fat has as strong an association with insulin resistance as visceral fat, and altered muscle composition, suggestive of increased fat content, is an important independent marker of insulin resistance in obesity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of the antistaphylococcal effects of meropenem and cloxacillin in vitro and in experimental infection.  
AB  - The efficacies of meropenem (MPM) and cloxacillin (CLC) against two Staphylococcus aureus strains were established in vitro. A pharmacodynamic model equation, based on the concept that the killing rate depends on concentration and time, was fitted to the numbers of CFU. The parameters of the equation are maximum killing rate, time point of maximum killing, and 50% effective concentration (EC50). The EC50s for the two strains were 0.047 and 0.040 mg/liter, respectively, for MPM and 0.105 and 0.121 mg/liter, respectively, for CLC. Calculated values of the parameters were used to predict the numbers of CFU at exponentially decreasing concentrations in vitro as well as in an experimental infection model. The prediction for in vitro conditions gave a satisfactory fit (R2, between 0.862 and 0.894). In vivo the numbers were predicted with the assumption that killing rate in vivo is proportional to that in vitro (R2, between 0.731 and 0.973). The proportionality factor ranged between 0.23 and 0.42; this variation was due mainly to covariation with growth rates in control animals, without other significant differences between antibiotics or strains.

TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.  
AB  - The concentration/MIC (C/MIC) ratio maximizing the bactericidal activity of ceftazidime against 10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients was identified. Bactericidal activity was assessed by determining the percent difference in the area under the killing curve at each C/MIC ratio for all of the isolates from that of their growth control. The percent effect at each C/MIC ratio was fitted to a sigmoidal Emax model with maximum bactericidal activity defined as the C/MIC ratio that produced an effect that was 90% of the Emax. Our results suggest that at least some isolates may require higher C/MIC ratios than previously reported for maximal activity.

TI  - ATP-ADP exchange reaction catalyzed by Na+,K+-ATPase: dephosphorylation by ADP of the E1P enzyme form.  
AB  - We studied the effects of Mg2+ and of ADP and other nucleoside diphosphates on the dephosphorylation of the E1P form of the partially purified pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase at 20-22 degrees C. We report for the first time the rate of the reversal of ATP phosphorylation. The experiments were done on enzyme subjected to controlled chymotrypsin digestion consisting of a homogenous population of a truncated catalytic subunit. Under this condition the whole cycle is E1 <-- (f1.ATP, b1) --> E1ATP <-- (f2, b2) --> E1P.ADP <-- (fd, bd.ADP) --> E1P-(f3) --> E1. The values of f1, b1, f2, and f3 were independently estimated in the absence of ADP; those of fd, bd, and b2 were obtained from the fit of ADP-dependent dephosphorylation data to the differential equation set. When f2 = 0 or b1 is very large, the model predicts that dephosphorylation by ADP gives a single exponential; in all other cases it predicts a biphasic dephosphorylation in a semilogarithmic plot. The fast phase is governed by b2.ADP and the slow one by b1.This was experimentally verified. Also, ADP stimulates E1P breakdown without release of Pi, thus leading to ATP synthesis. The data indicate that the true substrate for ATP synthesis is free ADP, while Mg2+ inhibits mainly by a reduction in the free [ADP]; in addition, E1P has a very low affinity for MgADP. The nucleotide structure is also very important; all ADP analogues tested were much less effective than ADP due to a reduced affinity for the E1P and a poor capacity to reverse phosphorylation.

TI  - A flexible approach to time-varying coefficients in the Cox regression setting.  
AB  - Research on methods for studying time-to-event data (survival analysis) has been extensive in recent years. The basic model in use today represents the hazard function for an individual through a proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972). Typically, it is assumed that a covariate's effect on the hazard function is constant throughout the course of the study. In this paper we propose a method to allow for possible deviations from the standard Cox model, by allowing the effect of a covariate to vary over time. This method is based on a dynamic linear model. We present our method in terms of a Bayesian hierarchical model. We fit the model to the data using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Finally, we illustrate the approach with several examples.

TI  - Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test: structure of a modified German version.  
AB  - The Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is widely used in scientific research as well as in clinical practice. But there exists little research on the structure of the AVLT. We investigated the structure of a German version of the AVLT and VLMT, in 232 patients of a psychiatric clinic and in 872 patients of an epileptologic clinic. First we stated a theoretical LISREL model relating the observed variables of the VLMT to short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) as latent variables. Then we estimated the postulated LISREL model in the two samples. The proposed model showed excellent fit in both samples, and there were no significant deviations between the estimated and the observed covariance matrices. Thus, STM and LTM suffice to explain the structure of the VLMT, and the proposed structural equations model can be used to estimate STM and LTM capacity from VLMT data.

TI  - Increase in DNA single-strand break rejoining by continuous exposure of human mononuclear blood cells to radioiodine ((131)I) in vitro.  
AB  - Radioiodine ((131)I) induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in DNA single-strand breaks (DNA-ssb) in human (G0) mononuclear blood cells (MNC) in vitro. Incubation of MNC with 22MBq (131)I/ml at 4 degrees C caused a linear, time-dependent induction of DNA-ssb (increase in elution rate: 24.7 x 10(-3) h(-1) per 100 min incubation with (131)I). However, if MNC were incubated at 37 degrees C a decrease in the slope of the time effect curve was observed after about 300 min incubation with 22 or 30 MBq (131)I/ml. The goodness of fit of different regression models was assessed by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).  The best fit was obtained for a non-linear model (y=a+bx+cx(0.5); AIC=53.5; where x is incubation time and y is elution rate), whereas other models including the linear regression model y=a+bx; AIC=38.6) were worse. As the total induction of DNA-ssb at 4 degrees C was constant with time, the decrease in the slope of the time effect curve (DNA-ssb versus time) at 37 degrees C can be interpreted as an increase in rejoining of DNA-ssb. Inhibition of both RNA and protein synthesis clearly increased the extent of DNA-ssb observable after incubation with (131)I. Thus, during continuous exposure of MNC to (131)I, proteins were synthesized which rejoined DNA-ssb. However, incubation of MNC with (131)I (44 MBq/ml) at 37 degrees C under conditions expected to lead to inhibition of RNA and/or protein synthesis still resulted in a decrease of the slope of the time effect curve, indicating a stimulation of DNA-ssb rejoining. Thus, we favour the hypothesis that the increase in the activity of DNA-ssb rejoining, besides de novo synthesis of repair enzymes, is also caused by a post-translational stimulation of DNA-repair enzymes and that this stimulation possibly is mediated by DNA-fragments.

TI  - Cytoskeleton modulates coupling between availability and activation of cardiac sodium channel.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate modulation of voltage-dependent steady-state activation and availability from inactivation of the cardiac Na+ channel by the cytoskeleton. As an experimental approach, we used long-lasting monitoring [63 +/- 5 (SE) min] of the half-point potentials of the steady-state availability curve (V(1/2A)) and normalized conductance curve (V(1/2G)) in 116 rat ventricular cardiomyocytes by whole cell patch clamp at 22-24 degrees C. Both half-point potentials shifted in the negative direction with time as an exponentially saturating change, with the shift of V(1/2G) being smaller and faster. An F-actin disrupter, cytochalasin D (Cyto-D, 20 microM), accelerated the rate of the V(1/2A) shift but decreased the range of the V(1/2G) shift. An F-actin stabilizer, phalloidin (100 microM), temporarily (for 28.2 +/- 2.2 min, n = 15) prevented the V(1/2A) shift but did not influence the V(1/2G) shift. The best fit for the V(1/2G)-V(1/2A) relationship in untreated cells (1,021 data points measured in 51 cells) was a second-degree (2.06) power function. Cytoskeleton-directed agents modified the relationship. In Cyto-D-treated cells, the V(1/2G)-V(1/2A) relationship was shifted (by 2.5 mV) toward positive V(1/2G). On the contrary, a microtubule stabilizer, taxol (100 microM), shifted the relationship toward negative V(1/2G) (by 12.2 mV). We conclude that coupling between availability and activation is modulated by F-actin-based and microtubular cytoskeleton.

TI  - Adrenergic modulation of human colonic motor and sensory function.  
AB  - The effects of pharmacological modulation of adrenergic receptors on colonic motor and sensory function are unclear. We studied 40 healthy volunteers in a single-blind design; 12 received saline, and the remaining 28 received either clonidine, yohimbine, phenylephrine, or ritodrine. A barostat-manometric assembly in the left colon recorded drug effects on fasting and postprandial motor function, compliance, and sensation in response to standardized phasic balloon distensions delivered in random order. Clonidine reduced and yohimbine increased fasting, but not postprandial tone, by 63.2 +/- 22.3% and 24.8 +/- 8.8% (SE), respectively. Clonidine tended to reduce fasting phasic activity in the descending and sigmoid colon. A power exponential model provided the best fit to the compliance curve. Clonidine significantly increased colonic compliance. Clonidine reduced and yohimbine increased colonic perception of pain but not gas sensation during distension. Phenylephrine and ritodrine did not influence colonic motor or sensory function in the present studies. Thus alpha 2-receptors modulate fasting colonic tone and compliance and alter perception of pain but not gas during mechanical stimulation of the colon.

TI  - Manuo-ocular coordination in target tracking. II. Comparing the model with human behavior.  
AB  - Several studies have shown that humans track a moving visual target with their eyes better if the movement of this target is directly controlled by the observer's hand. The improvement in performance has been attributed to coordination control between the arm motor system and the smooth pursuit (SP) system. In such a task, the SP system shows characteristics that differ from those observed during eye-alone tracking: latency (between the target-arm and the eye motion onsets) is shorter, maximum SP velocity is higher and the maximum target motion frequency at which the SP can function effectively is also higher. The aim of this article is to qualitatively evaluate the behavior of a dynamical model simulating the oculomotor system and the arm motor system when both are involved in tracking visual targets. The evaluation is essentially based on a comparison of the behavior of the model with the behavior of human subjects tracking visual targets under different conditions. The model has been introduced and quantitatively evaluated in a companion paper. The model is based on an exchange of internal information between the two sensorimotor systems, mediated by sensory signals (vision, arm muscle proprioception) and motor signals (arm motor command copy). The exchange is achieved by a specialized structure of the central nervous system, previously identified as a part of the cerebellum. Computer simulation of the model yielded results that fit the behavior of human subjects observed during previously reported experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The parallelism between physiology and human behavior on the one hand, and structure and simulation of the model on the other hand, is discussed.

TI  - Analysis of telemetric time series data for periodic components using DQ-FIT.  
AB  - DQ-FIT and CV-SORT have been developed to facilitate the automatic analysis of data sampled by radiotelemetry, but they can also be used with other data sampled in chronobiological settings. After import of data, DQ-FIT performs conventional linear, as well as rhythm analysis according to user-defined specifications. Linear analysis includes calculation of mean values, load values (percentage of values above a defined limit), highest and lowest readings, and areas under the (parameter-time) curve (AUC). All of these parameters are calculated for the total sampling interval and for user-defined day and night periods. Rhythm analysis is performed by fitting of partial Fourier series with up to six harmonics. The contribution of each harmonic to the overall variation of data is tested statistically; only those components are included in the best-fit function that contribute significantly. Parameters calculated in DQ-FIT's rhythm analysis include mesor, amplitudes, and acrophases of all rhythmic components; significance and percentage rhythm of the combined best fit; maximum and minimum of the fitted curve and times of their occurrence. In addition, DQ-FIT uses the first derivative of the fitted curve (i.e., its slope) to determine the time and extent of maximal increases and decreases within the total sampling interval or user-defined intervals of interest, such as the times of lights on or off. CV-SORT can be used to create tables or graphs from groups of data sets analyzed by DQ-FIT. Graphs are created in CV-SORT by calculation of group mean profiles from individual best-fit curves rather than their curve parameters. This approach allows the user to combine data sets that differ in the number and/or period length of harmonics included. In conclusion, DQ-FIT and CV-SORT can be helpful in the analysis of time-dependent data sampled by telemetry or other monitoring systems. The software can be obtained on request by every interested researcher.

TI  - Exploring the fitness landscapes of lattice proteins.  
AB  - We present methods to investigate the sequence to structure relation for proteins. We use random structures of HP-type lattice models as a coarse grained model to study generic properties of biopolymers. To circumvent the computational limitations imposed by most lattice protein folding algorithms we apply a simple and fast deterministic approximation algorithm with a tunable accuracy. We investigate ensemble properties such as the conditional probability to find structures with a certain similarity at a given distance of the underlying sequence for various alphabets. Our results suggest that the structure landscapes for lattice proteins are generally very rugged, while larger alphabets fine tune the folding process and smoothen the map. This implies a simplification for evolutionary strategies. The applied methods appear to be helpful in the study of the complex interplay between folding strategies, energy functions and alphabets. Possible implications to the investigation of evolutionary strategies or the optimization of biopolymers are discussed.

TI  - Passive stress-strain measurements in the stage-16 and stage-18 embryonic chick heart.  
AB  - The first stress-strain measurements on embryonic cardiovascular tissue are described here, obtained from cyclic uniaxial loading of the primitive ventricle. An excised ventricular segment from Hamburger/Hamilton stage-16 or stage-18 chicks (2-1/2 and 3 days of a 21-day incubation period) was mounted longitudinally between two small wires in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegia solution. One wire was attached to an ultrasensitive force transducer and the other to a Huxley micromanipulator controlled by remote motor drive. A real-time video tracking system calculated three myocardial surface strains based on the positions of three surface markers while the heart was deformed in a triangular wave pattern. Force transducer output was filtered, digitally sampled, and stored with strains and time. Results were plotted as strain (longitudinal, circumferential, shear, and principal) versus time, stress versus time, and stress versus longitudinal strain. The stress-strain curves were nonlinear, even at low strain levels. The hysteresis loops were large; mean hysteresis energy as a proportion of total cycle stored strain energy was 36 percent (stage 16) and 41 percent (stage 18). We created a finite element model of the ventricle and fit the model behavior to the experimental behavior to determine parameters for a stage-18 pseudoelastic strain-energy function of exponential form. The calculated exponential parameter is significantly lower than that found in corresponding uniaxial studies of mature myocardium, possibly indicating the lower fiber content of the immature tissue. The results of this study are the first step in characterizing material properties for comparisons with later developmental stages and with impaired and altered myocardium. The long-term goal is to aid in identifying the biomechanical factors regulating growth and morphogenesis.

AB  - To understand the nature of distribution of schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) eggs in stool of the infected individuals, it is assumed that if regression coefficient b approaches two in the equation lg (v) = a + blg(m), with a larger mean of egg counts (m), they can be considered compatible with negative binomial distribution. Results of this study showed egg counts of S. japonicum in stool of the same infected individual on different days and in male and female population can be described by negative binomial distribution, with 95 percent confidence intervals of coefficient of regression 1.3006-2.2956, 1.6109-1.9703, 1.7060-2.1589, and 1.5507-2.2359, respectively. Goodness of fit tests for the observed data indicated that fitting for negative binomial distribution was good. It suggests that the method of moments (coefficient of regression) can be used to determine whether the observed distribution of frequencies is compatible with a negative binomial one.

As previously seen in a complex of the same antigen with another antibody which recognizes a different epitope within antigenic site A, the receptor recognition motif Arg-Gly-Asp and some residues from an adjacent helix participate directly in the interaction with the complementarity-determining regions of the antibody. Remarkably, the structures of the two antibodies become more similar upon binding the peptide, and both undergo considerable induced fit to accommodate the peptide with a similar array of interactions. Furthermore, the pattern of reactivities of five additional antibodies with versions of the antigenic peptide bearing amino acid replacements suggests a similar pattern of interaction of antibodies raised against widely different antigens of serotype C. The results reinforce the occurrence of a defined antigenic structure at this mobile, exposed antigenic site and imply that intratypic antigenic variation of FMDV of serotype C is due to subtle structural differences that affect antibody recognition while preserving a functional structure for the receptor binding site.

TI  - A method for assessing age-time disease incidence using serial prevalence data.  
AB  - This paper considers nonparametric estimation of age- and time-specific trends in disease incidence using serial prevalence data collected from multiple cross-sectional samples of a population over time. The methodology accounts for differential selection of diseased and undiseased individuals resulting, for example, from differences in mortality. It is shown that when a log-linear incidence odds model is adopted, an EM algorithm provides a convenient method for carrying out maximum likelihood estimation, primarily using existing generalized linear models software. The procedure is quite general, allowing a range of age-time incidence models to be fitted under the same framework. Furthermore, by making use of existing software for fitting generalized additive models, the procedure can be generalized with virtually no extra complexity to allow maximization of a penalized likelihood for smooth nonparametric estimation. Automatic choice of smoothing level for the penalized likelihood estimates is discussed, using generalized cross-validation. The method is applied to a data set on serial toxoplasmosis prevalence, which has previously been analyzed under the assumption of nondifferential selection. A variety of age-time incidence models are fitted, and the sensitivity to plausible differential selection patterns is considered. It is found that nonmultiplicative models are unnecessary and that qualitative incidence trends are fairly robust to differential selection.

TI  - A comprehensive model for enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin transformation and disposition in dog.  
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, its major active metabolite, were determined in dog after oral and intravenous administrations of enrofloxacin and intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin. A comprehensive model of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin disposition was constructed to investigate the extent of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin transformation and the influence of the hepatic first-pass effect on the parent compound oral bioavailability. Plasma levels were measured using a validated HPLC method. Enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin plasma concentration data were fitted simultaneously using a set of differential equations describing a six-compartment model (two compartments for each analyte, one for the liver, and one for the intestinal tract); it was assumed that only a fraction of enrofloxacin was metabolized to ciprofloxacin and that this conversion only occurred in the liver.  The fitted parameters obtained from the model were used to calculate plasma clearances (0.729 +/- 0.212 L/h/kg for enrofloxacin, 0.468 +/- 0.094 L/h/kg for ciprofloxacin), distribution volumes (2.45 +/- 0.49 L/kg for enrofloxacin, 1.92 +/- 0.33 L/kg for ciprofloxacin), mean residence times (3.47 +/- 0.78 h for enrofloxacin, 4.20 +/- 0.82 h for ciprofloxacin), and the fractions of enrofloxacin metabolized to ciprofloxacin after intravenous and oral administrations of enrofloxacin. It was shown that enrofloxacin was largely metabolized to ciprofloxacin and that the fractions of metabolized enrofloxacin were similar after intravenous and oral administrations of enrofloxacin (40.44 +/- 10.08 and 40.17 +/- 8.33%, respectively), the hepatic first-pass effect being low (7.15 +/- 1.99%).

TI  - Stress fractures in female athletes. Diagnosis, management and rehabilitation.  
AB  - Stress fractures are a common overuse injury among athletes. The incidence of stress fractures among females is higher in the military, but this difference is not as evident in the athletic population. The history of the patient with stress fracture is typically one of insidious onset of activity-related pain. If the patient continues to exercise, the pain may well become more severe or occur at an earlier stage of exercise. As well as obtaining a history of the patient's pain and its relation to exercise, it is important to determine the presence of predisposing factors. On physical examination, the most obvious feature is localised bony tenderness. Occasionally, redness, swelling or periosteal thickening may be present at the site of the stress fracture. The diagnosis of stress fracture is primarily a clinical one; however, if the diagnosis is uncertain, various imaging techniques can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In the majority of stress fractures, there is no obvious abnormality on plain radiograph. Although the triple phase bone radiograph is extremely sensitive, the fracture itself is not visualised and it may be difficult to precisely locate the site, especially in the foot. The radionuclide scan will detect evolving stress fractures at the stage of accelerated remodelling, so the findings must be closely correlated with the clinical picture. The characteristic bone scan appearance of a stress fracture is of a sharply marginated area of increased uptake, usually involving one cortex of the bone. Computerised tomography scanning is a helpful addition if the fracture needs to be visualised, or to distinguish between a stress reaction and stress fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used increasingly as the investigation of choice for stress fractures. The typical findings on MRI are of periosteal and marrow oedema, as well as fracture line. The basis of treatment of a stress fracture involves rest from the aggravating activity. Most stress fractures will heal in a straightforward manner, and return to sport occurs within 6 to 8 weeks. The rate of resumption of activity should be influenced by symptoms and physical findings. When free of pain, the aggravating activity can be resumed and slowly increased. It is important that the athlete with a stress fracture maintain fitness during this period of rehabilitation. The most commonly used methods are cycling, swimming, upper body weights and water running. There are a number of specific stress fractures that require additional treatment because of a tendency to develop delayed union or nonunion. These include stress fractures of the neck of the femur, anterior cortex of the tibia, navicular and second and fifth metatarsals. An essential component of the management of stress fractures, as with any overuse injury, involves identification of the factors that have contributed to the injury and, where possible, correction or modification of some of these factors to reduce the risk of the injury recurring. Stress fractures are more common in female athletes with menstrual disturbances. This may be due to the effect on bone density. The role of hormonal replacement in the management of these athletes is unclear at this stage.

TI  - Echo machine-imposed limit on transmitral spectral Doppler velocity-profile analysis.  
AB  - We have previously developed a kinematic model of ventricular filling. Its application to in vivo transmitral Doppler velocity profiles provides a quantitative characterization of filling. However, the model parameters computed by solving the "inverse problem" may depend on ultrasound machine type and setting (e.g., gain, baseline filter, dynamic range). To determine machine-based effects on the computed model parameters, we performed a flow phantom study using Acuson and HP echocardiography machines at various settings. We compared maximum velocity envelopes (MVEs), as well as the model fit to these MVEs, for 3 simulated waveforms imaged by both machines. For all 3 waveforms, the machines generated comparable MVEs, fit by the model within a mean-square difference of 5E-5 (m/s)2. The associated variations in model parameters for the 3 waveforms were not uniform. Two waveforms showed slight variation between machines, with model parameters varying by less than 6%. The shortest duration waveform showed model parameter variations of 10-15%. Analysis of the parameter space for this waveform showed a constant mean-square error contour that was larger than that for the other two, causing similar small variations in measured MVEs to result in larger differences in the parameter estimates for this waveform. Because this method completely eliminates inter- and intraobserver variability, we conclude that, within the limits established, the slight contour variations due to machine type and setting should not affect this method's applicability in clinical Doppler-flow analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the underlying dimensions of the Caregiving Appraisal Scale (CAS) with use of data collected from caregivers of home-based ventilator-assisted individuals (VAIs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Residences of home-based VAIs. SAMPLE: Two hundred seventy-seven primary family caregivers of VAIs. MEASURES: Twenty-eight-item CAS developed by Lawton et al. (1989), and an investigator-developed instrument to assess physical health and sociodemographic characteristics of both VAIs and their caregivers. INTERVENTION: None. ANALYSIS: Confirmatory factor analysis with principal components extraction. An oblique (oblimin) solution was used for rotation of the factor matrices. The number of common factors needed to obtain the best fit of the factor model was determined with use of maximum-likelihood estimation. Confirmatory factor analysis with linear structural equation modeling was also performed. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis did not fully replicate the factor structure proposed by Lawton et al. CONCLUSIONS: The model proposed by Lawton et al. provides a useful foundation for examining the appraisal of family caregivers of home-based VAIs. Additional development work is needed for the CAS.

TI  - Optimum particle size distribution for reduced sintering shrinkage of a dental porcelain.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to develop a systematic method for obtaining an optimum particle size distribution for a given dental porcelain and compaction method that had a low sintering shrinkage. METHODS: Particles of coarse, medium and fine size were obtained from a commercial dental porcelain using a sedimentation method. Particle sizes were chosen so that the smaller particles would fit into the interstices between the next larger size. The different-sized powders were mixed in various proportions and compacted into a cylindrical mold. The specimens were fired and their linear firing shrinkages determined. An equation was developed to predict optimum proportions. The shrinkage of these mixed powders was compared to the shrinkage of the component powders, to the as-received commercial porcelain, and to predictions based on theoretical equations. These comparisons were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Differences (PLSD). RESULTS: Mixing specific proporations of different-sized particles significantly reduced sintering shrinkage (p = 0.01) for all mixtures except for one trimodal mixture having the smallest particles. These reductions in shrinkage were obtained for the proportions predicted by the developed equation. Sintering shrinkages for predicted proportions of a three-component mixture and two two-component mixtures were significantly less than that of the original powder (p = 0.01). SIGNIFICANCE: A systematic method was developed for producing dental frits with low firing shrinkage. Mixing of different-sized particles produced frits with lower sintering shrinkage. The optimum proportions of the sized particles were given by an equation. The results of this study suggest that optimum particle size distributions for frits are dependent upon compaction methods.

AB  - The fixation of tibial components randomized to insertion with or without cement in twenty-six knees was examined for inducible displacement at six weeks and one year postoperatively with use of roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis. Furthermore, migration was studied during the first two postoperative years. Inducible displacement was found in all knees at both the six-week and the one-year follow-up examination, but no differences were detected with respect to the type of fixation (p > 0.05). All tibial components migrated for as long as one year postoperatively, after which most stabilized. No difference was found between the groups with respect to migration during the first two years postoperatively (p > 0.05), with the exception of subsidence of the component, which was found to be 0.0+/-0.1 millimeter (mean and standard error of the mean) for the components inserted with cement and 0.5+/-0.1 millimeter for the components inserted without cement (p < 0.01). Migration after one year was the same for both groups. We found a relationship between inducible displacement at six weeks and at one year as well as one between inducible displacement and migration at one year. To our knowledge, the present study is the first in which the micromotion of an interference-fit prosthesis was found to be similar to that of a device inserted with cement. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of the initial prosthetic fixation.

The study included serial examinations (n = 31; plasma Phe levels: 0.47-2.24 mmol/l) of patients either receiving a Phe-restricted diet (200 mg Phe per day; four patients) or a diet rich in Phe (1000 mg Phe per day; three patients). No spectrum showed metabolic abnormalities besides elevated Phe. Difference spectroscopy yielded intracerebral Phe concentrations between 0.20 and 0.76 mmol/l. Regional variations between parieto-occipital periventricular brain, frontal brain, and cerebellum were not statistically significant. Data could be fitted assuming saturable Phe transport into the brain, based on a symmetric Michaelis-Menten model (characterized by an apparent Michaelis transport constant, K(t,app), and a maximum transport velocity, Tmax) and constant Phe consumption in the brain cells (described by a velocity Vmax). Non-linear least-squares fitting of the combined data from all patients yielded K(t,app) = 0.16 +/- 0.11 mmol/l and (Tmax / Vmax) = 9.0 +/- 4.1. Carrier saturation and competitive inhibition of the influx of other large neutral amino acids can be expected at plasma Phe levels usually found in PKU patients.

Seven mutants that fell into six different complementation groups were found to fit this criterium. Two of the mutants (ysl1 and ysl2) are new, two others are defective in the VAN1 gene. Mutants in VAN1 were previously identified by their resistance to the drug orthovanadate. The others represent known endocytosis (rvs167 and sac6) and vacuolar protein sorting (vps41) mutants. As suggested by their genetic interactions with delta ypt51, the newly identified mutants are impaired in endocytosis, vacuolar protein sorting and vacuole biogenesis. In addition, van1 and ysl2 display actin cytoskeletal defects.

TI  - Multicenter outcome study of cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a probability of mortality model.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop prospectively and validate a model for probability of hospital survival at admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) of patients with malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an inception cohort study in the setting of four ICUs of academic medical centers in the United States. Defined continuous and categorical variables were collected on consecutive patients with cancer admitted to the ICU. A preliminary model was developed from 1,483 patients and then validated on an additional 230 patients. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to develop the models and subsequently evaluated by goodness-of-fit and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The main outcome measure was hospital survival after ICU admission. RESULTS: The observed hospital mortality rate was 42%. Continuous variables used in the ICU admission model are PaO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and days of hospitalization pre-ICU. Categorical entries include presence of intracranial mass effect, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, recurrent or progressive cancer, albumin less than 2.5 g/dL, bilirubin > or = 2 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Score less than 6, prothrombin time greater than 15 seconds, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) greater than 50 mg/dL, intubation, performance status before hospitalization, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The P values for the fit of the preliminary and validation models are .939 and .314, respectively, and the areas under the ROC curves are .812 and .802. CONCLUSION: We report a disease-specific multivariable logistic regression model to estimate the probability of hospital mortality in a cohort of critically ill cancer patients admitted to the ICU. The model consists of 16 unambiguous and readily available variables. This model should move the discussion regarding appropriate use of ICU resources forward. Additional validation in a community hospital setting is warranted.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease in patients with dysvascular amputation.  
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Among patients who have undergone lower extremity amputation as a result of PVD, the prevalence of concomitant cardiovascular disease may be as high as 75%. Comorbid heart disease may complicate the postamputation course of recovery, delay initiation of rehabilitation training, and inhibit the achievement of maximal functional independence. A variety of methods have been used to assess cardiac status and risk in amputation patients undergoing physical training; these have included clinical evaluation, resting electrocardiography, and continuous dynamic electrocardiography during either standard physical therapy exercise or adapted ergometry. Several conditioning training programs have been developed to improve the cardiovascular fitness of patients with dysvascular amputation, the results of which have been favorable. These assessment and intervention strategies have extensive applicability in the clinical management of patients with dysvascular amputation.

AB  - We studied muscle fatigue in 19 paraplegic patients during an isometric sustained contraction. Both quadriceps (n = 38) were maximally stimulated for 126 s. We defined a nonlinear equation with four coefficients to fit the data and extract fatigue indices carrying information on the amount (asymptotic values, torque coordinate at the inflection point, total decrement from initial value) and the rate of torque decrease (maximum slope, time constant, time coordinate at the inflection point, time at which the torque reached 50% of initial value). Most of the indices reported in the literature provide information limited to the amount of torque decrease. Three of the coefficients we defined could be graphically estimated. The goodness of fit was very high (r2 = 0.993 +/- 0.001) but none of the indices provided information on both the amount and the rate of decrease. Major differences were encountered among the patients. Therefore, some of the computed indices varied to a great extent. We studied the curves exhibiting the same fatigue indices and defined a simple general fatigue index able to distinguish from muscles having different resistance to fatigue (asymptotic value x the time constant). This index is carrying both types of information and is expressed in relative torque x second (range from 1.81 to 22.82).

TI  - A comparison of low volume, draize and in vitro eye irritation test data. II. Oil/water emulsions.  
AB  - The second phase in a series of investigations of the relationship between low volume eye test (LVET) data, Draize eye irritation test data, and comparable data from in vitro eye irritation test protocols is presented. These investigations utilize Draize eye test and in vitro endpoint data generated previously as part of the CTFA Evaluation of Alternatives Program. LVET data were generated de novo using the same 18 representative oil/water based personal-care formulations. In general, these formulations were minimally to mildly irritating; only three were classified as moderate eye irritants. The linear correlation between maximum average score as determined by the Draize test (MAS) and the LVET (LVET-MAS) was 0.85; LVET-MAS values were typically about half the corresponding MAS values. Comparison of in vitro assay performance with that of the LVET was determined by statistical analysis of the relationship between LVET-MAS and each in vitro endpoint. Regression modelling was the primary means of enabling such a comparison, the objective being to predict LVET-MAS for a given test material (and to place upper and lower 95% prediction bounds on the range in which the LVET-MAS is anticipated to fall with high probability) based on observation of an in vitro score for that material. The degree of confidence in prediction is quantified in terms of the relative widths of prediction intervals constructed about the fitted regression curves. Sixteen endpoints were shown to have the greatest agreement with the LVET (all but two were selected for modelling when compared with the Draize procedure). While the lower maximum average scores values (compared with the Draize test) in the LVET led to lower variability in LVET-MAS compared to MAS, the upper and lower bounds on predicted LVET-MAS values conditional on observed in vitro scores were still wide. Because there was overlap in the range of scores determined by the prediction bounds for many formulations, each of the selected endpoints was frequently unable to distinguish between test formulations in terms of statistically different predicted LVET-MAS values. In summary, none of the in vitro endpoints evaluated were able to reliably predict values of LVET-MAS among the set of oil/water emulsions considered here.

TI  - Components of variability in the systolic blood pressures of preschool children.  
AB  - The term "horse-racing effect" refers to a positive correlation between the slope at which blood pressure increases with age and blood pressure level at a baseline. Previous studies have reported such an effect in adults, while studies in children have found a negative correlation (termed "the Jenss effect"). These studies used analytic methods in which it was assumed that the blood pressure slopes were constant or the blood pressure profiles were linear. In this study, the authors used a components-of-variance approach that did not require this assumption in order to model serial blood pressure measurements made in 216 US preschool children (mean age at first analyzable blood pressure observation, 58.9 months) at 6-13 visits over a 3-year period (1986-1989). Measurements were made using an automated blood pressure monitor. Values from the second and third measures at each visit were averaged to obtain each observation. Data from 2,203 blood pressure observations were available for analysis. For the full group, over the mean period of observation of 21.1 months, the mean rate of increase was 3.45 mmHg/year for systolic blood pressure and 0.06 mmHg/year for diastolic blood pressure. In the authors' model, 33 percent of the total marginal variability in systolic blood pressure was attributed to random error (visit-to-visit variability); average (constant) subject-specific difference from the population slope accounted for 42 percent, and a nonlinear component of variability around the subject-specific average accounted for the remaining 25 percent. All three components were statistically significant. Models which assumed that the slopes were constant did not fit these data, and fitting these models to the data led to an artifactual negative correlation between subject-specific slopes and intercepts. An implication of this is that the concepts of "horse-racing" and "the Jenss phenomenon," which have been operationalized by testing the covariance of the subject-specific slopes and intercepts using models which assume that the blood pressure slopes are constant over time, should not be applied to data that contain this nonlinear component of variance.

TI  - In vivo effects of dexmedetomidine on laser-Doppler flow and pial arteriolar diameter.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The alpha2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine alters global cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, few studies have investigated the action of dexmedetomidine on the cerebral microcirculation. This investigation examined the effects of dexmedetomidine on (1) regional CBF in the rat cerebral cortex using laser-Doppler flowmetry and (2) on pial arteriolar diameter. METHODS: Halothane-anesthetized rats were fitted with instruments to measure CBF as determined by laser-Doppler flow (CBFldf) or to measure pial arteriolar diameter by preparing a cranial hollow deepened until a translucent plate of skull remained, thereby maintaining the integrity of the cranial vault. In both groups, 20 microg/kg dexmedetomidine was infused intravenously. Thirty minutes later, the mean arterial pressure was restored to control values with an infusion of phenylephrine (0.5 to 5 microg/kg/min). RESULTS: Administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with decreases in end-tidal and arterial carbon dioxide. The CBFldf and pial arteriolar diameter were measured during normocapnia (controlled carbon dioxide) and during dexmedetomidine-induced hypocapnia. Intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine significantly decreased systemic arterial pressure concurrent with a decrease in CBFldf (22% in normocapnic animals, 36% in hypocapnic animals). Restoration of mean arterial pressure increased CBFldf in normocapnic but not in hypocapnic animals. Similarly, dexmedetomidine significantly reduced pial vessel diameter in both normocapnic (9%) and hypocapnic animals (17%). However, vessel diameters remained decreased in the normocapnic and hypocapnic animals after the mean arterial pressure was restored. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a modulation of cerebral vascular autoregulation by dexmedetomidine which may be mediated, in part, by alterations in carbon dioxide. Dexmedetomidine may have a direct action on the cerebral vessels to reduce the CBF during normo- or hypocapnia. The differences between CBFldf and pial arteriole responses to restoration of mean arterial pressure may reflect the difference in measurement techniques because laser-Doppler measurements reflect the net effect of several arterial segments on microvascular perfusion, whereas diameter measurements specifically examined individual pial arterioles, suggesting that dexmedetomidine vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature may be differentially and regionally mediated.

TI  - Vagal modulation of heart rate during exercise: effects of age and physical fitness.  
AB  - This study was designed to assess the effects of age and physical fitness on vagal modulation of heart rate (HR) during exercise by analyzing the instantaneous R-R interval variability from Poincare plots (SD1) at rest and at different phases of a bicycle exercise test in a population of healthy males. SD1 normalized for the average R-R interval (SD1n), a measure of vagal activity, was compared at rest and during exercise among subjects of ages 24-34 (young, n = 25), 35-46 (middle-aged, n = 30), and 47-64 yr (old, n = 25) matched for peak O2 consumption (VO2 peak) and among subjects with VO2 peak of 28-37 (poor, n = 25), 38-45 (average, n = 36), and 46-60 ml.kg-1.min-1 (good, n = 25) matched for age. SD1n was higher at rest in the young subjects than in the middle-aged or old subjects (39 +/- 14, 27 +/- 16, and 21 +/- 8, respectively; P < 0.001), but the age-related differences in SD1n were smaller during exercise [e.g., 11 +/- 5, 9 +/- 5, and 8 +/- 4 at the level of 100 W; P = not significant (NS)]. The age-matched subjects with good, average, and poor VO2 peak showed no difference in SD1n at rest (32 +/- 17, 28 +/- 13, and 26 +/- 11, respectively; P = NS), but SD1n differed significantly among the groups from a low to a moderate exercise intensity level (e.g., 13 +/- 6, 10 +/- 5, and 6 +/- 3 for good, average, and poor fitness groups, respectively; P < 0.001, 100 W). These data show that poor physical fitness is associated with an impairment of cardiac vagal function during exercise, whereas aging itself results in more evident impairment of vagal function at rest.

TI  - Fitting multistate transition models with autoregressive logistic regression: supervised exercise in intermittent claudication.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a model that predicts the outcome of supervised exercise for intermittent claudication. The authors present an example of the use of autoregressive logistic regression for modeling observed longitudinal data. Data were collected from 329 participants in a six-month exercise program. The levels of the polytomous outcome variable correspond to states they defined in a Markov decision model comparing treatment strategies for intermittent claudication. Autoregressive logistic regression can be used to fit multistate transition models to observed longitudinal data with standard statistical software. The technique allows exploration of alternative assumptions about the dependence in the outcome series and provides transition probabilities for different covariate patterns. Of the alternatives examined, a Markov model including two preceding responses, time, age, ankle brachial index, and duration of disease best described the data.

TI  - Admission-discharge policies for hysteroscopic surgery: a randomised comparison of day case with in-patient admission.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness and acceptability of day case hysteroscopic surgery. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. SUBJECTS: One hundred and ninety four consecutive women who underwent hysteroscopic endometrial ablation. INTERVENTION: Seventy three women were allocated to day case surgery and 37 to inpatient admission; 84 women though otherwise fit for day case surgery were scheduled for in-patient admission as they lived more than 20 miles away. All women completed a questionnaire 24 h after their operations. Readmission rates were obtained from case notes. Satisfaction rates 12 months after the operation were recorded by means of a follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: Post-operative pain was absent or slight in 48 (75%) of the women in the day case group 27 (84%) of women in the in-patient group, and 55 (82%) in the non-randomised in-patient group. Post-operative analgesia was necessary in 34 (52%) women in the day case group, 24 (75%) women in the in-patient group and 36 (53%) women in the non-randomised in-patient group. Hospital costs were significantly less in the day case group. Satisfaction with stay 92% in the day case group, and 100% in the other two groups. CONCLUSION: In this setting, day care is a safe acceptable and less expensive alternative to in-patient care for hysteroscopic endometrial ablation.

TI  - Guanidinated protein test meals with higher concentration of soybean trypsin inhibitors increase ileal recoveries of endogenous amino acids in pigs [see comments]  
AB  - The amino acid concentrations of cornstarch-based guanidinated unprocessed (UGM) and autoclaved (AGM) Nutrisoy (defatted soy flour) protein test meals were compared with the respective unguanidinated Nutrisoy diets. Endogenous ileal recoveries and true digestibilities of amino acids were determined in six growing pigs, fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum, fed the guanidinated protein test meals. The UGM and AGM contained 13.4 (high) and 3.0 (low) g/kg dry matter of soybean trypsin inhibitors (SBTI), respectively. The experiment was a two-period cross-over design with each period lasting 15 d. On d 14 of each period, the pigs were fed the guanidinated test meals followed by 24 h continuous collection of digesta. Concentrations of crude protein and most of the amino acids in the test meals were higher than in the respective diets. Apparent ileal amino acid digestibilities of the test meals did not differ (P > 0.05) from reported values for the respective diets and were higher (P < 0.05) by 22.7 (cysteine) to 61.3 (tyrosine) percentage units for AGM compared with UGM. The ileal recoveries of endogenous amino acids in AGM-fed pigs were lower (P < 0.05) than UGM-fed pigs. Values ranged from -0.10 (arginine) to 0.64 (aspartate + asparagine) and from 0.84 (histidine) to 2.61 (tyrosine) g/kg dry matter intake for AGM- and UGM-fed pigs, respectively. True ileal amino acid digestibilities for AGM were higher (P < 0.05) than UGM with differences ranging from 12.7 (tyrosine) to 38.3 (leucine) percentage units. In conclusion, ileal recoveries of endogenous amino acids were increased in pigs fed guanidinated protein test meals with the higher concentration of SBTI.

TI  - Short- and long-term results with implantable transcutaneous and percutaneous bone-conduction devices.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the percutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA; type NBC-HC-200, Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden) and the transcutaneous temporal bone stimulator (TBS; Xomed-Treace, Jacksonville, Fla) with conventional hearing aids and to evaluate long-term results. DESIGN: In a prospective clinical study, the new implantable bone-conduction devices were compared with the patients' previous conventional hearing aids. Speech perception in quiet and in noise were studied, and a questionnaire concerning the actual use of the device and speech recognition was administered. During follow-up that exceeded 4 1/2 years, relevant technical and medical problems were documented. PATIENTS: Forty-one successive subjects who were fitted with a BAHA and 17 subjects who were fitted with a TBS. RESULTS: In most subjects who had previously used a bone-conduction device, the new BAHA and TBS devices led to improved or comparable results on speech recognition tests and the questionnaire. However, among the subjects who had previously used air-conduction hearing aids, the results were ambiguous. In the long-term, the percentage of nonusers in the BAHA group was 5% (2/39); in the TBS group, 65% (13/20). The main reasons for not using the TBS were insufficient gain and medical and technical problems. The vulnerability of the percutaneous coupling of the BAHA to trauma or inflammation was not a major issue; only 4 implants were lost during the total follow-up of more than 250 years. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the BAHA is the better choice.

TI  - Development of a new standard laboratory protocol for estimating the field attenuation of hearing protection devices. Part III. The validity of using subject-fit data.  
AB  - The mandate of ASA Working Group S12/WG11 has been to develop "laboratory and/or field procedure(s) that yield useful estimates of field performance" of hearing protection devices (HPDs). A real-ear attenuation at threshold procedure was selected, devised, tested via an interlaboratory study, and incorporated into a draft standard that was approved in 1997 [J. D. Royster et at., "Development of a new standard laboratory protocol for estimating the field attenuation of hearing protection devices. Part I. Research of Working Group 11, Accredited Standards Committee S12, Noise," J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, 1506-1526 (1996); ANSI S12.6-1997, "American National Standard Methods for Measuring Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing Protectors" (American National Standards Institute, New York, 1997)]. The real-world estimation procedure utilizes a subject-fit methodology with listeners who are audiometrically proficient, but inexperienced in the use of HPDs. A key factor in the decision to utilize the subject-fit method was an evaluation of the representativeness of the laboratory data vis-a-vis attenuation values achieved by workers in practice. Twenty-two field studies were reviewed to develop a data base for comparison purposes. Results indicated that laboratory subject-fit attenuation values were typically equivalent to or greater than the field attenuation values, and yielded a better estimate of those values than did experimenter-fit or experimenter-supervised fit types of results. Recent data which are discussed in the paper, but which were not available at the time of the original analyses, confirm the findings.

TI  - Lifestyle, stress, and genes in peptic ulcer disease: a nationwide twin cohort study [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The familial accumulation of peptic ulcer disease observed in several studies may be attributable to genetic effects, aggregation of environmental exposure (shared environment), or both. The intrafamilial spread of Helicobacter pylori infection has raised the question whether shared environment could explain the familial aggregation of peptic ulcer disease rather than genetic similarity of family members. OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease in a nationwide population-based cohort of adult twins. METHODS: The Finnish Twin Cohort consists of all same-sexed twin pairs born before 1958 with both twins alive in 1975. The total number of twin pairs is 13888, of whom 4307 are monozygotic (MZ) and 9581 are dizygotic (DZ) twins. Questionnaire surveys of twins were carried out in 1975, 1981, and 1990, including medical and psychosocial questions. One question asked whether a physician had ever made a diagnosis of gastric or duodenal ulcer. In addition, hospital discharge data from 1972 to 1991 were linked with the twin cohort to obtain those twin individuals who had been treated for gastric or duodenal ulcer. The prevalence of and concordance for peptic ulcer disease were examined in MZ and DZ twins. Model-fitting analysis was used to specify the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors. The contribution of lifestyle factors and stress was examined prospectively in an incidence study and by comparison of discordant pairs. RESULTS: The prevalence of peptic ulcer disease was 6.2% in men and 2.8% in women in 1975. There were 63 MZ and 86 DZ pairs concordant for peptic ulcer disease. Concordance for disease was significantly higher in MZ than in DZ twin pairs; the probandwise concordance rate was 23.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.9%-26.3%) in MZ twins and 14.8% (95% CI, 13.3%-16.3%) in DZ twins. In the model-fitting analysis, a model with both additive genetic and unshared environmental effects had the best goodness-of-fit. Thirty-nine percent (95% CI, 32%-47%) of the liability to peptic ulcer disease was explained by genetic factors and 61% (95% CI, 53%-68%) by individual environmental factors. In the incidence study (logistic regression analysis of the entire cohort initially free of peptic ulcer disease, with subjects diagnosed as having peptic ulcer after 1975 as cases), current smoking (relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.2) and high stress levels (relative risk, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.6) in men and regular use of analgesics (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1) in women predicted peptic ulcer disease during the follow-up from 1976 to 1991. In the analysis of discordant pairs, smoking in men and regular use of analgesics in both sexes were predictors of peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire and hospital usage data on peptic ulcer disease in the population-based twin cohort suggest that the familial aggregation of the disease is modest, and attributable almost solely to genetic factors. Environmental effects not shared by family members were significant predictors of disease, and they were attributable to smoking and stress in men and the use of analgesics in women. The minor effects of shared environment to disease liability do not support the concept that the clustering of risk factors, such as H pylori infection, would explain the familial accumulation of peptic ulcer disease.

TI  - Host and viral factors influencing heterosexual HIV transmission.  
AB  - The World Health Organization estimates that 28-30 million people have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although many important questions remain, much has been learned regarding the biology of heterosexual HIV transmission. For example, most sexual transmission of HIV is probably mediated by cell-free virus. Langerhans cells in the vaginal epithelium and dendritic cells or macrophages in the lamina propria are the most likely target cells in HIV transmission. Although there is restriction in the genotypes of viruses that are sexually transmitted, the common phenotypic characteristic of these viruses does not appear to be related to in vitro measures of tropism but rather to the relatively high in vivo replicative fitness of the transmitted viral variants. Clearly, host factors such as the amount of HIV-1 co-receptor expression on host cells and the presence of ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases affect the susceptibility of an individual to HIV infection. The growing body of information has increased the likelihood that a vaccine capable of preventing HIV-1 infection after exposure during sexual activity will be developed in the foreseeable future.

TI  - Glycinergic synaptic inputs to bipolar cells in the salamander retina.  
AB  - 1. Glycine activated strychnine-sensitive chloride conductances at both the dendrites and the axonal telodendria of most bipolar cells in the salamander retina. 2. The chloride equilibrium potential of bipolar cells was found to be negative to -50 mV, indicating that glycinergic synapses on bipolar cells are inhibitory. 3. Some bipolar cells exhibited discrete, strychnine-sensitive, chloride-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). These were elicited by focal application of glutamate at the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Glycinergic synapses were localized using simultaneous focal application of calcium to retinal slices bathed in calcium-free media. Both dendritic and telodendritic glycinergic IPSCs were observed. 4. The decay of the telodendritic IPSCs was well fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 17.7 +/- 8.7 ms. Similar kinetics were observed for dendritic IPSCs in some cells, but in one class of on-centre bipolar cell the decay of the dendritic IPSCs was better fitted by a sum of two exponentials with time constants 9.9 +/- 4.3 and 51.3 +/- 24.3 ms. 5. The dendritic IPSCs were best driven by application of glutamate at the distal IPL (the off sublamina), while the telodendritic IPSCs were driven best by application near the telodendria. These results suggest that bipolar cell dendrites receive inhibitory glycinergic inputs from interplexiform cells that are excited by off-centre bipolar cells, whereas bipolar cell telodendria receive glycinergic amacrine cell inputs that are antagonistic to the photoreceptor inputs. 6. Both inputs could be elicited in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), but the dendritic IPSCs were sometimes abolished by TTX, suggesting that sodium-dependent spikes play an important role in the transmission of interplexiform cell signals to the outer plexiform layer.

TI  - A randomized trial of physical activity interventions: design and baseline data from project active.  
AB  - We report here the design and baseline data from Project Active, a 2-yr randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of a Lifestyle physical activity intervention with the traditional Structured exercise prescription approach. Primary outcome measures are energy expenditure in physical activity (estimated by kcal per kilogram of body weight of energy expenditure) and cardiorespiratory fitness (measured by maximal oxygen uptake). The participants, 235 initially sedentary and apparently healthy adults, were randomized into either the Lifestyle or Structured intervention groups. The Lifestyle treatment consists of a personalized approach that accounts for an individual's motivational readiness and preferences for integrating physical activity into daily routines. The Structured approach is the familiar exercise prescription that is based on a frequency, intensity, and duration formula. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that there will be a difference in physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness measures between the two conditions at the end of 24 months. The secondary hypothesis is that both groups will make significant improvements from baseline in physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness at the end of 6 months. Six months of active intervention are followed by 18 months of a tapered follow-up maintenance intervention in both groups. Primary outcome measures are measured after 6 and 24 months.

TI  - Dual spillover problem in the myocardial septum with nitrogen-13-ammonia flow quantitation.  
AB  - Conventional cardiac PET modeling techniques for [13N]ammonia flow determination do not fully account for the effects of spillover of activity from the right ventricle (RV) onto the activity in the myocardial septum. The purpose of this study was to investigate and to quantitatively account and correct for this effect. METHODS: Simulations were performed to determine the error introduced by conventional quantitation using septal time-activity curves, which only account for left ventricle (LV) spillover. Furthermore, we explored two separate methods to account for the dual spillover problem: direct estimation of the RV and LV spillover fractions incorporated into the [13N]ammonia model by using the LV and RV input functions in the fit and estimation of the relative dispersion and time shift between the LV and RV input functions by fitting using only the LV input function. The simulated curves were fitted using a two-compartment [13N]ammonia model. Flow estimates from the conventional model and the models including either of the two correction procedures were compared with canine microsphere data. RESULTS: The influence of RV spillover on flow estimation in the septum is determined by several parameters (e.g., dispersion between the RV and LV input function). Depending on the value of these parameters, the septal flow may be underestimated by 0%-30%. The applied methods for correction of the dual spillover problem were comparable and allow for more accurate quantitation in the septum. The canine microsphere data revealed that flow underestimation in the septum is small but significant. CONCLUSION: Dual spillover in the myocardial septum can introduce significant errors in the estimation of flow by the conventional [13N]ammonia model fitting method, which does not properly account for the RV spillover. Adjusting for the RV spillover in one of the two proposed methods allows for more accurate quantitation of myocardial septal flow with [13N]ammonia PET data.

TI  - Digital image processing measurement of the upper eyelid contour in Graves disease and congenital blepharoptosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used image processing techniques to quantify the upper eyelid contour of patients with Graves upper eyelid retraction and congenital blepharoptosis. DESIGN: The study design was a cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29 patients with Graves disease, 22 patients with congenital blepharoptosis, and 50 patients with no history of eye disease participated. INTERVENTION: The images of the palpebral fissure of all participants were transferred to a personal computer and processed with NIH Image 1.55 software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following parameters were analyzed: the curvature of the upper eyelid contour, the position of the contour peak relative to the midline, and the ratio between the temporal and nasal upper quadrant areas of the palpebral fissure. RESULTS: All upper eyelid contours could be fitted with second-degree polynomial functions. The mean temporal/nasal area ratio was 1.33 mm in patients with Graves disease, 0.92 mm in patients with blepharoptosis, and 1.04 mm in control subjects. The peak of the upper eyelid contour was found to be lateral to the midline in control subjects (1.05 mm) and in patients with Graves disease (2.09 mm). In patients with blepharoptosis, the peak was 0.69 mm medial to the midline. Overall, the distance between the midpupil and the upper eyelid margin was correlated with several factors: the degree of curvature, the position of the peak of the eyelid contour, and the temporal/nasal area ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In Graves eyelid retraction, the curvature of the upper eyelid is enhanced, the peak of the contour is displaced laterally, and the temporal upper quadrant area is increased. Conversely, in congenital blepharoptosis, the eyelid is almost flat, the peak of the contour is displaced medially, and the upper quadrant area is diminished. The lateral segment of the upper eyelid is more involved than the nasal segment in both Graves upper eyelid retraction and congenital blepharoptosis.

TI  - Mathematical models of growth in stature throughout childhood.  
AB  - Growth models for predicting child stature are useful to summarize both the pattern and timing of growth in individuals and populations. Jolicoeur el al. described the JPPS model and compared it with the models of Preece and Baines (PB1) and Shohoji and Sasaki (SS). More recently Jolicoeur et al. described the JPA2 model, an extension of the JPPS. Here the JPPS model is studied in greater depth, and with more subjects, compared to the PB1 model and a modification of the SS model (SSC). The JPPS model gives consistently the best fit, although the SSC model is also better appreciably than the PB1. It is shown that biological parameters can be derived from the model parameters. Both infancy and adult data are required for the JPPS model to fit well. In some subjects the JPPS velocity curve suggests a mid-growth spurt, but it does not usually indicate a spurt in the underlying data. The SSC model is shown to be similar to Karlberg's ICP model. Overall the JPPS model provides a good fit to the child stature curve.

TI  - Microsatellites reveal heterosis in red deer.  
AB  - The fitness consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding are poorly understood in natural populations. We explore two microsatellite-based variables, individual heterozygosity (likely to correlate with recent inbreeding) and a new individual-specific internal distance measure, mean d2 (focusing on events deeper in the pedigree), in relation to two measures of fitness expressed early in life, birth weight and neonatal survival, in 670 red deer calves (Cervus elaphus) born on the Isle of Rum between 1982 and 1996. For comparison, we also analyse inbreeding coefficients derived from pedigrees in which paternity was inferred by molecular methods. Only 14 out of 231 calves (6.1%) had non-zero inbreeding coefficients, and neither inbreeding coefficient nor individual heterozygosity was consistently related to birth weight or neonatal survival. However, mean d2 was consistently related to both fitness measures. Low mean d2 was associated with low birth weight, especially following cold Aprils, in which foetal growth is reduced. Low mean d2 was also associated with low neonatal survival, but this effect was probably mediated by birth weight because fitting birth weight to the neonatal survival model displaced mean d2 as an explanatory variable. We conclude that in the deer population fitness measures expressed early in life do not show evidence of inbreeding depression, but they do show evidence of heterosis, possibly as a result of population mixing. We also demonstrate the practical problems of estimating inbreeding via pedigrees compared with a direct marker-based estimate of individual heterozygosity. We suggest that, together, individual heterozygosity and mean d2, estimated using microsatellites, are useful tools for exploring inbreeding and outbreeding in natural population.

TI  -  Health-related fitness test battery for adults: associations with perceived health, mobility, and back function and symptoms.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health-related content validity of nine fitness tests by studying how low, mid, and high levels of fitness are associated with perceived health and musculoskeletal functioning. DESIGN: Cross-sectional methodological study. SETTING: A research institute for health promotion. PARTICIPANTS: Middle-aged (37 to 57 years) men (n = 245) and women (n = 253), evenly selected from five age cohorts of a random population sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The odds ratios (ORs) of selected health outcomes for low (least fit 20%), mid (next 40%), and high (most fit 40%) fitness categories in the different tests adjusted for several possible confounders. RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by 2-km walk test, was strongly and consistently associated with perceived health and mobility (stair climbing) in both genders (range of ORs, 2.4 to 17.6), and a somewhat weaker relationship was found with leg power and with leg strength (ORs, 2.5 to 7.2). Low fitness in back muscular endurance and upper-body strength were associated with mobility disability (ORs, 2.8 to 8.5) and with back dysfunction and pain (ORs, 2.9 to 6.1). High fitness in back endurance in men and in balance in women were related to positive back health (ORs, 2.5 to 3.7). Body mass index was associated with musculoskeletal disability in women (ORs, 2.4 to 5.3). Balance, leg strength, and leg flexibility in men; and leg power, trunk and leg flexibility in women were not associated with health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among a middle-aged population, the majority of the evaluated fitness tests demonstrated health-related validity by strong associations with perceived health and musculoskeletal functioning, and by weaker associations with back symptoms.

TI  - Pelvic floor exercises versus vaginal weight cones in genuine stress incontinence.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare pelvic floor exercises and vaginal weight cones in the treatment of genuine stress incontinence. STUDY DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty ambulatory and fit white women (mean age 56 years) with urinary stress incontinence, treated by a single physiotherapist as outpatients during twelve weeks. Thirty women were allocated to a weekly session of pelvic floor exercises. Thirty were allocated to using cones, they were seen every two weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Objective: stress test, vaginal squeezing capacity. Subjective: urinary diary, visual analogue scales. RESULTS: Characteristics of both study groups were comparable. Unfortunately, there was an early withdrawal of fourteen (47%) women in the group treated with cones, and none in the other group. Therefore the pelvic floor exercise group was compared not only with the group intended to be treated with cones, but also with the selected group that only received cone therapy. No statistically significantly differences in outcome measures were found between the groups: 53% in the group assigned to pelvic floor exercises and 57% into the group assigned to cones, of which 50% in the group actually treated with cones, considered themselves as cured or improved to a significant degree. Long-term follow-up was not possible as all cone users refused continued exercises with cones once the twelve weeks had ended. CONCLUSION: Pelvic floor exercises and cones are equally effective in the treatment of genuine stress incontinence. Cones are cost and time saving. However, the low patient compliance with the cones importantly limits its clinical applicability, especially in the long run. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of cones.

TI  - Assessing psychiatric impairment in primary care with the Sheehan Disability Scale.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several recent studies have documented that substantial functional impairment is associated with many of the mental disorders seen in primary care. However, brief measures of mental health-related functional impairment are not commonly applied in primary care settings. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a three-item instrument for assessing such impairment, is evaluated in this study. METHOD: A psychometric analysis of the SDS was conducted with a sample of 1001 primary care patients at Kaiser Permanente In Oakland, California. The SDS and the Symptom Driven Diagnostic System for Primary Care assessments were completed. RESULTS: The internal consistency reliability of the SDS is high, with coefficient alpha of 0.89. The construct validity was substantiated in two ways. A one-factor model fit the data quite well. Furthermore, patients with each of six psychiatric disorders had significantly higher impairment scores than those who did not. Finally, over 80 percent of the patients with mental disorder diagnoses had an elevated SDS score and nearly 50 percent of those with elevated SDS scores had at least one disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the SDS were evaluated in primary care. The internal consistency reliability was high. The analyses also lend empirical support for the construct validity. The scale is a sensitive tool for identifying primary care patients with mental health-related functional impairment, who would warrant a diagnostically-oriented mental health assessment.

TI  -  A three-Gaussian fit of phantom scatter correction data.  
AB  - The phantom scatter correction factor Sp of megavoltage photon beams can be accurately described using a three-Gaussian fit. The model leads to six parameters, with which Sp(r) is described as a smooth function of the field radius r for beam qualities in the range from 60Co up to 25 MV. The parameters allow Sp values to be calculated at intermediate beam energies and for any field shape. Calculated Sp(X, Y) values for rectangular fields (X, Y) can be subsequently used as reference values to compare with measured Sp(X, Y) values, for example when appraising a new beam.

TI  - Endoscopic treatment of recurrent tracheo-oesophageal fistulae: long-term results.  
AB  - Recurrent tracheo-oesophageal fistula (RTOF) occurs in 5%-15% of patients following oesophageal atresia repair. Re-thoracotomy is technically challenging and associated with significant morbidity, including a re-fistulation rate of 10%-22%. Endoscopic occlusion of the RTOF with tissue adhesives (fibrin glue, Histoacryl) is reported to be safe and highly effective. However, long-term results of such therapy are absent from the literature. A postal survey of 13 institutions reporting the use of such treatment regimes for RTOF in the literature between 1974 and 1995 was performed, and data collected concerning the long-term outcomes of their reported patients. Eleven institutions responded to the request for data, providing 22 patients (age range 1 month to 12 years) for review. All had undergone initially successful RTOF closure by endoscopic methods and had been followed up for a median of 107 months (range 3-264 months). There was no morbidity or mortality directly related to the procedure. Overall, only 55% of these endoscopically treated fistulas remained closed long-term. Fistula recurrence invariably occurred within 12 months of successful therapy (median 46 days, range 9-335). Most patients required multiple endoscopic procedures to achieve successful RTOF closure (median 2.0, range 1-4 attempts), although significantly fewer attempts were required with fibrin glue therapy. Surgical re-exploration remains the treatment of choice in the fit child. Endoscopic therapy offers a safe and elegant alternative to high-risk surgery in the sick child, although repeated treatments may be required for successful RTOF closure.

TI  - Modulation of host cell receptors: a mechanism for the survival of malaria parasites.  
AB  - Intra-erythrocytic stages of malaria parasites can alter the surface of their host cells and release toxins which induce the production of cytokines, which in turn can up- or down-regulate the expression of adhesion receptors on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells. New adhesion receptors on endothelial cells provide the parasite with increased chances of survival despite an increasing level of host immunity. In order to take advantage of these new opportunities for survival, the parasite itself needs to make best use of its considerable ability to vary its surface antigens and adherent molecules. The paper describes the various players in this survival game and articulates a working hypothesis to explain how it may all fit together.

TI  - [Hearing aids among the elderly--not only in the drawer!]  
AB  - The majority of hearing-aids are offered to elderly patients with presbyacusis. It is commonly assumed in the general population and among health professionals that many hearing-aids are not being used regularly on a daily basis. 83 patients over the age of 70 were visited unannounced and interviewed in their homes. They had received their first or replacement hearing-aid from six months to two years earlier. The main purpose of the interview was to examine to what extent the hearing-aids were in regular use. Nearly half of the patients said they wore their hearing-aid when they opened the front door and that they used it constantly during the day. This was also confirmed by relatives. One of five stated that they did not use the hearing-aid at all, or that they were not able to find it. The majority of users were satisfied with their hearing-aid, and relatives found it to be of great help. Even patients over 80 years old managed to fit their hearing-aid themselves, regulate the volume and change the batteries. There was an even distribution of all-day users regardless of the extent of hearing loss. Whether the hearing-aid was prescribed on the initiative of a third party or not made little difference to the extent of its use. A significant difference was found between first-time users and those with a replacement hearing-aid, replacement hearing-aids being used much more frequently. We conclude that hearing-aids are indeed being used by the majority of elderly people with impaired hearing and that they are of great benefit to them. It is difficult to predict from the medical history and audiometric data of the individual patient exactly how much the hearing-aid will be used later and how beneficial it will be. Patients should therefore be allowed to test a hearing-aid at home for a period of time and to return it if it is found to be of little benefit.

TI  - Molecular modeling of phenothiazines and related drugs as multidrug resistance modifiers: a comparative molecular field analysis study.  
AB  - A set of 40 phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and structurally related drugs with multidrug resistance modulating activity in tumor cells in vitro were selected from literature data and subjected to three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship study using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). More than 350 CoMFA models were derived and evaluated using steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic fields alone and in combination. Four alignment strategies based on selected atom pairs or field fit alignment were compared. Several training and test sets were analyzed for both neutral and protonated drug forms separately. Each chemical class was trained and tested individually, and finally the classes were combined together into integrated models. All models obtained were statistically significant and most of them highly predictive. All fields contributed to MDR reversing activity, and hydrophobic fields improved the correlative and predictive power of the models in all cases. The results point to the role of hydrophobicity as a space-directed molecular property to explain differences in anti-MDR activity of the drugs studied.

AB  - Although adverse reproductive outcomes have been associated with arsenic exposure, the extent and severity of the effects of chronic inhalation of low levels of arsenic on reproduction are not known. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study of stillbirths in a central Texas community that included a facility with more than a 60-year history of producing primarily arsenic-based agricultural products. We collected data on 119 cases and 267 controls randomly selected from healthy live-births at the same hospital and matched for year of birth. We abstracted medical and demographic data for the period January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1993, from hospital records and estimated socioeconomic status by median income from the 1990 Population and Housing Census data. We estimated arsenic exposure levels from airborne emission estimates and an atmospheric dispersion model and linked the results to a geographical information system (GIS) database. Exposure was linked by GIS to residential address at time of delivery. A conditional logistic regression model was fitted including maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, income group, exposure as a categorical variable, and exposure-race/ethnicity interaction. The prevalence odds ratio observed for Hispanics in the high-exposure group (>100 ng per m3 arsenic) was 8.4, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.4-50.1.

TI  - A realistic closed-form radiobiological model of clinical tumor-control data incorporating intertumor heterogeneity [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the role of intertumor heterogeneity in clinical tumor control datasets and the relationship to in vitro measurements of tumor biopsy samples. Specifically, to develop a modified linear-quadratic (LQ) model incorporating such heterogeneity that it is practical to fit to clinical tumor-control datasets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a modified version of the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for tumor control, incorporating a (lagged) time factor to allow for tumor cell repopulation. We explicitly took into account the interpatient heterogeneity in clonogen number, radiosensitivity, and repopulation rate. Using this model, we could generate realistic TCP curves using parameter estimates consistent with those reported from in vitro studies, subject to the inclusion of a radiosensitivity (or dose)-modifying factor. We then demonstrated that the model was dominated by the heterogeneity in alpha (tumor radiosensitivity) and derived an approximate simplified model incorporating this heterogeneity. This simplified model is expressible in a compact closed form, which it is practical to fit to clinical datasets. Using two previously analysed datasets, we fit the model using direct maximum-likelihood techniques and obtained parameter estimates that were, again, consistent with the experimental data on the radiosensitivity of primary human tumor cells. This heterogeneity model includes the same number of adjustable parameters as the standard LQ model. RESULTS: The modified model provides parameter estimates that can easily be reconciled with the in vitro measurements. The simplified (approximate) form of the heterogeneity model is a compact, closed-form probit function that can readily be fitted to clinical series by conventional maximum-likelihood methodology. This heterogeneity model provides a slightly better fit to the datasets than the conventional LQ model, with the same numbers of fitted parameters. The parameter estimates of the clinically important time factors and lag periods are very similar to those obtained from the conventional LQ model, but with slightly narrower confidence intervals, reflecting the better fit to the clinical data. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated, as have others, the importance of intertumor heterogeneity in the response of patient populations to radiotherapy. With the possible inclusion of a radiosensitivity-modifying factor (in vitro/in vivo) of around 1.7, the in vivo data can be made consistent with the in vitro SF2 and Tpot data. Fitting two previously analyzed multicenter datasets indicated that previous analyses based on conventional LQ models gave results for clinically important time factors and lags periods that were not significantly biased by the failure to include intertumor heterogeneity, with slightly narrower confidence intervals, reflecting the better fit to the clinical data. The simple closed-form model we have developed allows direct estimation of the heterogeneity in radiosensitivity within clinical series, and should prove useful in the analysis of other clinical series.

TI  - Energy expenditure and physical fitness in overweight vs non-overweight prepubertal girls.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether overweight children have lower physical activity energy expenditure (EE) and fitness levels than non-overweight children. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four healthy girls aged 7-10 y were divided into overweight (> 95th percentile weight-for-height) and non-overweight (10-90th percentile) groups. Basal metabolic rate (BMR), sleeping metabolic rate (SMR), 24 h sedentary EE (SEE) and total EE (TEE) were measured by room respiration calorimetry and doubly labelled water. Physical activity EE and physical activity level (PAL) were calculated.  Fitness (VO2peak) was measured by a treadmill exercise test. RESULTS: The overweight group had significantly higher body weight, percent fat, fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) (P < 0.001). The overweight girls had higher BMR, SMR, SEE and TEE (P < 0.001), but not after adjustment for FFM. Physical activity EE and PAL were not significantly different between groups. After adjusting for FFM or weight, submaximal and peak VO2 were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that these overweight girls do not have lower physical activity EE or fitness levels than the non-overweight prepubertal girls, however, the rather high body fat of the non-overweight group may have precluded us from finding any differences between groups.

TI  - Occupational therapy and rehabilitation: an awkward alliance.  
AB  - This article argues that although occupational therapy and rehabilitation are often considered synonymous, the latter is but one aspect of the former. Early influences on occupational therapy are briefly reviewed, and some philosophical ideas about activity are described. The rationale for the use of occupations as treatment in the early part of this century, both in Canada and in the United States, is examined and contrasted with the development of physical medicine and rehabilitation after World War II. This discussion demonstrates that the origins of occupational therapy and rehabilitation in North America had little in common. As occupational therapy became incorporated into rehabilitation, the profession's core values eroded, and although current definitions of rehabilitation offer a more appropriate fit for occupational therapy, rehabilitation continues to see engagement in occupations as a separate and subsequent step. The article concludes by considering future directions and the tasks that lie ahead.

TI  - Effect of diseases on the culling of Holstein dairy cows in New York State.  
AB  - The effect of seven diseases on culling was measured in 7523 Holstein cows in New York State. The cows were from 14 herds and had calved between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994; all cows were followed until September 30, 1995. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to incorporate time-dependent covariates for diseases. Different intervals representing stages of lactation were considered for effects of the diseases. Five models were fitted to test how milk yield and conception status modified the effect of diseases on culling. Covariates in the models included parity, calving season, and time-dependent covariates measuring diseases, milk yield of the current lactation, and conception status. Data were stratified by herd. The seven diseases and lactational risks under consideration were milk fever (0.9%), retained placenta (9.5%), displaced abomasum (5.3%), ketosis (5.0%), metritis (4.2%), ovarian cysts (10.6%), and mastitis (14.5%). Older cows were at a much higher risk of being culled. Calving season had no effect on culling. Higher milk yield was protective against culling. Once a cow had conceived again, her risk of culling dropped sharply. In all models, mastitis was an important risk factor throughout lactation. Milk fever, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, ketosis, and ovarian cysts also significantly affected culling at different stages of lactation. Metritis had no effect on culling. The magnitude of the effects of the diseases decreased, but remained important, when milk yield and conception status were included as covariates. These results indicated that diseases have an important impact on the actual decision to cull and the timing of culling. Parity, milk yield, and conception status are also important factors in culling decisions.

TI  - Evolution of competitive fitness in experimental populations of E. coli: what makes one genotype a better competitor than another?  
AB  - An important problem in microbial ecology is to identify those phenotypic attributes that are responsible for competitive fitness in a particular environment. Thousands of papers have been published on the physiology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics of Escherichia coli and other bacterial models. Nonetheless, little is known about what makes one genotype a better competitor than another even in such well studied systems. Here, we review experiments to identify the phenotypic bases of improved competitive fitness in twelve E. coli populations that evolved for thousands of generations in a defined environment, in which glucose was the limiting substrate. After 10,000 generations, the average fitness of the derived genotypes had increased by approximately 50% relative to the ancestor, based on competition experiments using marked strains in the same environment. The growth kinetics of the ancestral and derived genotypes showed that the latter have a shorter lag phase upon transfer into fresh medium and a higher maximum growth rate. Competition experiments were also performed in environments where other substrates were substituted for glucose. The derived genotypes are generally more fit in competition for those substrates that use the same mechanism of transport as glucose, which suggests that enhanced transport was an important target of natural selection in the evolutionary environment. All of the derived genotypes produce much larger cells than does the ancestor, even when both types are forced to grow at the same rate. Some but not all, of the derived genotypes also have greatly elevated mutation rates. Efforts are now underway to identify the genetic changes that underlie those phenotypic changes, especially substrate specificity and elevated mutation rate for which there are good candidate loci. Identification and subsequent manipulation of these genes may provide new insights into the reproducibility of adaptive evolution, the importance of co-adapted gene complexes, and the extent to which distinct phenotypes (e.g., substrate specificity and cell size) are affected by the same mutations.

TI  - Long-term esthetic provisional restorations in dentistry.  
AB  - The role of interim dental restorations used for indirect restorative and prosthodontic procedures has changed dramatically in the past several years. These restorations are no longer regarded as temporary restorations but rather as provisional restorations with distinct functions and purposes. Provisional restorations have become a vital diagnostic and assessment tool to evaluate function color, shape, contour, occlusion, periodontal response, implant healing, and overall esthetics.  An accurate fit and margination is essential to insure and maintain pulpal health of the tooth. With increased demands being placed on provisional restorations, new materials and techniques are being developed and some existing protocols are being refined to accomplish the desired goals. Provisional restorations are often in the oral environment for several months, requiring a well-fabricated and stable restoration. This review is designed to report on current materials, techniques, and concepts in fabricating and maintaining long-term esthetic provisionals.

AB  - We have examined apoptosis and proliferation in lymph node cell suspensions from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using flow cytometry. A method was developed which allowed estimation of the fractions of apoptotic cells and cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle simultaneously with tumour-characteristic light chain expression. Analysis of the tumour S-phase fraction and the tumour apoptotic fraction in lymph node cell suspensions from 95 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients revealed a non-normal distribution for both parameters. The median fraction of apoptotic tumour cells was 1.1% (25 percentiles 0.5%, 2.7%). In the same samples, the median fraction of apoptotic normal cells was higher than for the tumour cells (1.9%; 25 percentiles 0.7%, 4.0%; P = 0.03). The median fraction of tumour cells in S-phase was 1.4% (25 percentiles 0.8%, 4.8%), the median fraction of normal cells in S-phase was significantly lower than for the tumour cells (1.0%; 25 percentiles 0.6%, 1.9%; P = 0.004). When the number of cases was plotted against the logarithm of the S-phase fraction of the tumour cells, a distribution with two Gaussian peaks was needed to fit the data. One peak was centred around an S-phase fraction of 0.9%; the other was centred around 7%. These peaks were separated by a valley at approximately 3%, indicating that the S-phase fraction in NHL can be classified as 'low' (< 3%) or 'high' (> 3%), independent of the median S-phase fraction. The apoptotic fractions were log-normally distributed. The median apoptotic fraction was higher (1.5%) in the 'high' S-phase group than in the 'low' S-phase group (0.8%; P = 0.02). However, there was no significant correlation between the two parameters (P > 0.05).

TI  - Extent and consequences of physician delay in the diagnosis of acral melanoma.  
AB  - The extent and consequences of professional delay in diagnosis were analysed in 83 patients with palmoplantar and subungual melanomas treated from January 1986 to March 1997 in our department. Seventeen (52%) out of 33 subungual melanomas and 10 (20%) out of 50 palmoplantar melanomas were clinically misdiagnosed by physicians. Three palmoplantar melanomas (6%) were initially misinterpreted by pathologists. In 23 of the 27 cases (85%) the clinical misdiagnosis was made by non-dermatologists. Misdiagnosis caused a median delay of 12 months in the diagnosis of palmoplantar melanomas and 18 months in the diagnosis of subungual melanomas. Delay in diagnosis was associated with increased tumour thickness, more advanced stage at time of melanoma diagnosis and a lower estimated 5-year survival rate (15.4% versus 68.9% for palmoplantar; 68.5% versus 90.9% for subungual). Acral melanomas are frequently misdiagnosed due to their less common locations and because plantar and subungual melanomas often do not fit the 'changing mole' pattern. To Improve the patient's prognosis it is necessary to increase the physicians' skill in the diagnosis of acral melanomas. Histological examination should always be performed in acral lesions that do not heal.

TI  - The cure for colon cancer: results from the EUROCARE study.  
AB  - The interpretation of time trends and geographical differences of population-based survival rates is generally not easy, due to the difficulty in disentangling the effects of observational biases, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and their interactions. Whereas descriptive analysis of relative survival is generally based on survival levels estimated at fixed time since diagnosis, interpretation issues can take advantage from the analysis of the shape of the considered relative survival. Parametric survival models allowing the estimation of the fraction of cured patients are applied here to analyze and discuss the differences in colon cancer relative survival between European countries, according to age and period of diagnosis. The survival curves of colon cancer patients are described according to 2 parameters: the proportion of cured patients and the mean survival time of fatal cases. These parameters are estimated by least square nonlinear regression of relative survival values derived from the EUROCARE Project publication. Exponential and Weibull survival functions are used to model the relative survival curve for the fraction of fatal cases. The Weibull model gives generally a better fit with respect to the exponential model, thus indicating that the mortality rate for fatal cases is decreasing with time since diagnosis. For the youngest patients, however, the 2 survival functions give practically overlapping estimates. The overall proportion of colon cancer patients in Europe that are estimated to be cured was 38.6%. This proportion increased from 36% to 40% for patients diagnosed in 1978-1980 and in 1983-1985, respectively. Accordingly, mean survival time of fatal cases increased from 1.18 to 1.52 years. According to age, the proportion of cured patients present a marked decrease from young (48.4% at age 15-44 years) to middle-aged patients (38.6% at age 5564 years) and only a mild decrease from these to the oldest patients (34.4% at age 75 or more). The opposite effect was shown by survival time of fatal cases, i.e., 1.71, 1.75 and 0.77 years for the same age classes, respectively. Proportion of cured cases and mean survival time of fatal cases tended to be positively correlated with each other across countries. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a real improvement in colon cancer survival took place in Europe during the years 1978-1985 and also suggest that the well-known decrease of relative survival with age at diagnosis could be mostly due to a decreasing efficacy of early diagnosis for patients under 60 years old and to less effective therapies for older patients.

TI  - Associations between skeletal muscle properties, physical fitness, physical activity and coronary heart disease risk factors in men.  
AB  - High physical fitness and physical activity are associated with favourable lipid levels, especially a high level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). A person's skeletal muscle properties, metabolism and percentage of different muscle fibres (ST-%), which may modify coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, such as serum insulin, obesity and serum sex hormones may also influence his fitness level and leisure-time physical activity. We studied the associations of physical fitness, physical activity and ST-% with serum lipids and lipoproteins in 72 healthy men. Their parameters were compared with those of 20 men with defined CHD. Significant interrelationships between ST-%, fitness and leisure-time physical activity index (LTPAI) were observed. Multiple regression analysis showed that ST-%, fitness and leisure-time physical activity explained about 32% of the variation in HDL-C in the healthy men. In healthy men ST-% correlated positively with fitness (r(s) = 0.62, P < 0.001) and with LTPAI (r(s) = 0.62, P < 0.001). Fitness level also correlated significantly with LTPAI (r(s) = 0.81, P < 0.001). Serum insulin showed negative associations with ST-% (r(s) = -0.63, P < 0.001) and fitness (r(s) = -0.54, P < 0.001) and LTPAI (r(s) = -0.62, P < 0.001). Free fraction of testosterone correlated negatively with serum HDL-C level (r(s) = -0.34, P < 0.01), with fitness (r(s) = -0.41, P < 0.001) and with LTPAI (r(s) = -0.54, P < 0.001). In sedentary men with the lowest fitness and physical activity the mean of ST-% (45%) was similar to that in CHD patients (44%). However, ST-% in men in the highest tertile of physical activity and fitness (68%) was significantly higher than in CHD patients and in men in the lowest tertile of physical activity and fitness. Skeletal muscle enzyme activity in lipid metabolism was significantly lower in both CHD patients and in sedentary and low-fit men than that in fitter and physically active men. The present data imply that skeletal muscle properties are important determinants of risk profiles, such as physical activity, fitness and serum lipid and lipoprotein patterns. Although fitness is a graded, independent predictor of mortality from CHD, a relatively high fitness level is not enough. This was clearly observed in the clustering analysis, in which the healthy men, according to their ST-%, fitness, leisure-time physical activity and serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), fell into three natural groups: (i) Inactive men with lowest ST-% (mean 42%), lowest fitness (10.7 METs) and lowest HDL-C (1.36 mm/l); (ii) Fit men with high ST-% (66%), high fitness (14.5 METs) and moderately high HDL-C (1.54 mol/l); (iii) Active men with high ST-% (66%), highest fitness (14.9 METs) and highest serum HDL (1.83 mmol/l). The results support the idea that both fitness and physical activity give further protection against CHD by modifying risk factors. Our findings also suggest that skeletal muscle properties should be considered in the studies which assess CHD risk factors and their modifications especially in the field of health-related fitness.

TI  - Intrauterine contraceptive devices and antigestagens as emergency contraception.  
AB  - Although the Yuzpe regimen of emergency contraception is the one most commonly used, there are alternatives. Copper-containing intrauterine devices are very effective and can be inserted for at least 5 days after unprotected intercourse and sometimes longer. They may, however, transmit pre-existing infection into the upper genital tract and cause discomfort when being fitted. Progestogen-only emergency contraception appears, from WHO studies, to be a useful adjunct to current therapies. Mifepristone has been studied in various doses and has been shown to be very effective but is not yet commercially available. Health services should provide a full range of methods including emergency contraception by appropriately trained people in an acceptable environment.

TI  - Predicting hearing aid response in real ears.  
AB  - A hearing aid fitted to different ears will produce very different sound pressure spectra in the ear canal. In addition, this variation in response is different among hearing aids. A description in terms of an electrical analog model of the ear and hearing aid system is given. The applicability of this model is tested through series of measurements. The measurement and prediction procedure was first verified on a coupler (ear simulator) with good results from 300 to 8000 Hz. Three types of hearing aids were then measured and used on five different human ears. Where the measured and predicted response was compared a fairly good agreement was obtained from 300 Hz to approximately 6000 Hz. A major source of error is probe misalignment. The theoretical description given in the present work is likely to be valid from low frequencies to at least 10 kHz. Although solutions for related problems have been given for low frequencies, a solution of the hearing aid fitting problem at high frequencies has not been published earlier.

TI  - Determination of rotations in three dimensions using two-dimensional portal image registration.  
AB  - The relative relationships among anatomic features visualized on planar radiographic images change due to rotations of the patient out of the imaging plane. These changes can be predicted a priori from a three-dimensional radiographic model of the patient. In this study we assess the feasibility of using that information together with a planar image feature alignment tool to account for out-of-plane rotations in the evaluation of subsequent clinical patient images. A series of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) with known patient rotations was generated from a computed tomography scan of an anthropomorphic head phantom. Fixed anatomic features were extracted, as seen in the DRRs of rotated anatomy and entered into a database. Alignment of features from test radiographs with those from an entry in this database yielded an estimate of rotation out of plane (database entry that resulted in the best fit via planar transformation) along with the planar components of setup errors in the rotated plane. Tests using DRRs and films show that it is possible to select anatomic features in AP skull radiographs with position and orientation sensitive to out-of-plane rotation.

TI  - Optimal preload adjustment of maximal ventricular power index varies with cardiac chamber size.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maximal left ventricular power (PWRmax) can index contractile function and reserve; however, its marked preload dependence mandates load adjustment to yield a more cardiac-specific measurement. Prior studies have used varying methods, but supporting data have generally been lacking. We hypothesized that the optimal approach for preload adjustment varies with ventricular volume (particularly end-systolic volume) and is significantly different for dilated hearts with reduced left ventricular function compared with small to normal-sized hearts with normal systolic function. METHODS: Left ventricular pressure-volume relations were measured by the conductance catheter method in 36 patients, with preload altered by inferior vena cava obstruction. Patients with normal ventricles (n = 16), hypertrophy or mitral stenosis (n = 12), and dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 8) were divided into three groups based on resting end-diastolic volume: group 1, 66.3 +/- 12; group 2, 118.1 +/- 20; and group 3, 218.2 +/- 48 ml. PWRmax was the maximal product of simultaneous left ventricular pressure and rate of volume change. PWRmax end-diastolic volume (EDV) data were fit to a power function, PWRmax = alphaEDVbeta (where alpha is a scaling factor and beta is the power coefficient), and the preload sensitivity of beta and PWRmax/EDVbeta ratios (beta = 1, 2, or best fit) were compared. RESULTS: Beta varied directly with chamber size: 0 = 0.004 x (EDV + 0.56), r = 0.65, p < 0.0001. However, it was equally well approximated by 1.0 in groups 1 and 2 (ESV <75 ml, EF >40%), whereas beta = 2 was more appropriate in group 3. CONCLUSION: PWRmax/EDV provides adequate preload independence in all but dilated hearts with reduced LV function, whereas PWRmax/EDV2 is required in the latter. These data should help clinical application of a noninvasive PWRmax index for assessing chamber contractility and contractile reserve in human beings.

TI  - Effect of cholesterol on molecular order and dynamics in highly polyunsaturated phospholipid bilayers.  
AB  - The effect of cholesterol on phospholipid acyl chain packing in bilayers consisting of highly unsaturated acyl chains in the liquid crystalline phase was examined for a series of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The time-resolved fluorescence emission and decay of fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used to characterize equilibrium and dynamic structural properties of bilayers containing 30 mol % cholesterol. The bilayers were composed of symmetrically substituted PCs with acyl chains of 14:0, 18:1n9, 20:4n6, or 22:6n3, containing 0, 1, 4, or 6 double bonds, respectively, and mixed-chain PCs with a saturated 16:0 sn-1 chain and 1, 4, or 6 double bonds in the sn-2 chain. DPH excited-state lifetime was fit to a Lorentzian lifetime distribution, the center of which was increased 1-2 ns by 30 mol % cholesterol relative to the cholesterol-free bilayers. Lifetime distributions were dramatically narrowed by the addition of cholesterol in all bilayers except the two consisting of dipolyunsaturated PCs. DPH anisotropy decay was interpreted in terms of the Brownian rotational diffusion model. The effect of cholesterol on both the perpendicular diffusion coefficient D perpendicular and the orientational distribution function f(theta) varied with acyl chain unsaturation. In all bilayers, except the two dipolyunsaturated PCs, 30 mol % cholesterol dramatically slowed DPH rotational motion and restricted DPH orientational freedom. The effect of cholesterol was especially diminished in di-22:6n3 PC, suggesting that this phospholipid may be particularly effective at promoting lateral domains, which are cholesterol-rich and unsaturation-rich, respectively. The results are discussed in terms of a model for lipid packing in membranes containing cholesterol and PCs with highly unsaturated acyl chains.

TI  - Negative cooperativity in the steady-state kinetics of sugar oxidation by soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.  
AB  - Steady-state-kinetics investigations were carried out for the oxidation of aldose sugars by soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus using N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (PMS) as artificial electron acceptor. As is not uncommon for a dye-linked dehydrogenase, the enzyme showed ping-pong behaviour and double-substrate inhibition. However, under conditions that avoided its masking by sugar-substrate inhibition as much as possible, negative kinetic cooperativity with respect to sugar substrate oxidation by this enzyme was demonstrated. Arguments are presented that exclude trivial factors as a cause for the phenomenon observed. Experimental data could be fitted with an equation accounting for biphasic cooperativity containing two sets of apparent kinetic parameters, V1 and K1, and V1 and K2, representing the enzyme's Michaelis-Menten behaviour at low and high substrate concentrations, respectively. Assuming that subunit interaction causes the cooperativity effect, the sets express the performance of soluble GDH's two subunits in two states of mutual interaction. From fitting the experimental data for several sugars with this equation, it appeared that their V1 values were similar, although their K1 values varied considerably. This showed that the cooperativity effect dramatically changes the performance of soluble GDH, as reflected by the V2 and K2 values for glucose (in phosphate buffer) being about 10-fold and 100-fold higher than the V1 and K1 values, respectively. Substituting the Ca2+ involved in activation of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in soluble GDH by Sr2+ affected the cooperativity effect (an increase of the K1 value) but not the two turnover rates of the hybrid enzyme for glucose. The data suggest that the two catalytic cycles of soluble GDH have different rate-limiting steps compared with that of PQQ-containing methanol dehydrogenase.

TI  - Evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance of a major gene for bovine dilated cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to establish the mode of inheritance of bovine dilated cardiomyopathy (BDCMP). We analyzed a pedigree comprising 75 animals in three age classes and five diagnostic classes based on clinical and pathological findings using the Pedigree Analysis Package. Segregation analyses were performed under three models, a major gene model, a mixed model, and an environment model. Under each model three data sets were analyzed. In the first data set, only animals with clinically manifested BDCMP were considered affected; in the second data set, animals with no clinical findings but with strong pathological evidence were included in the group of affected animals; and in the third data set, this group was extended to include animals that were suspected of having BDCMP. For all three data sets, a recessive allele at a single biallelic major locus controlling the underlying liability fitted the data best. Based on Akaike's information criterion, the major gene model was the most efficient model in all data sets. We conclude that a single biallelic major locus is likely responsible for the disease.

TI  - Aspects of antigen mimicry revealed by immunization with a peptide mimetic of Cryptococcus neoformans polysaccharide.  
AB  - We have recently identified peptide mimetics of the Cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide by screening phage display peptide libraries. 2H1, one of a large family of mAbs against the glucuronoxylomannan fraction (GXM), is highly protective and binds several peptide motifs. This study analyzes the immunologic properties of P601E (SYSWMYE), a peptide from the low affinity motif (W/YXWM/LYE) that has an extended cross-reactivity among anti-GXM mAbs and whose binding correlates with the protective potential of mAbs in experimental infection. P601E is a mimetic, since it competes for GXM binding to 2H1, but not a mimotope, since it does not elicit an anti-GXM response. Sequence analysis of 14 anti-P601E mAbs indicates that anti-P601E mAbs elicited in BALB/c mice have an order of homology with 2H1 of V kappa > J kappa >> V(H) > J(H) > D. Further screening of a peptide library with anti-P601E mAbs isolated peptides having a motif almost identical to the peptide motif selected by 2H1. When these results are compared to the crystal structure of a related peptide in complex with 2H1, there is a clear correlation between the ability to elicit V region components of 2H1 Ab and peptide association with the V region, suggesting that the completeness of the fit in the binding site is an important driving force for mimicry. As a consequence, improving affinity of a mimetic for the Ab binding site seems to be the most logical way to insure that all of the appropriate V region segments are elicited and that useful mimotopes are created.

TI  - An evaluation of the factors influencing selection of the optimal size of laryngeal mask airway in normal adults.  
AB  - The purpose of this randomised single blinded study was to determine the optimal size of laryngeal mask airway in the normal adult population, to test the validity of the current selection criteria and to determine if any externally measured anatomical variable correlated with optimal size. In each of 30 apnoeic anaesthetised adults weighting less than 100 kg, size 3, 4 and 5 laryngeal mask airways were inserted in random order by a skilled user and the cuff inflated to a standard pressure (60 cm H2O). Optimal size was based on four criteria in order of priority: number of attempts at placement, oropharyngeal leak pressure, fiberoptic score and percentage of vocal cords seen. The size 5 laryngeal mask airway was optimal in 19/30 and the size 4 in 11/30. In no patient was the size 3 the optimal fit. Oropharyngeal leak pressure was significantly higher for each progressively large size and the fiberoptic view was significantly better for the size 4 and size 5. There was no significant predictive value in any externally measured anatomical variable, but height was the most useful. The best current selection strategy was to choose a size 5 for males and size 4 for females. Potentially useful new strategies may be to use the size 5 in all adults, or a size 5 > or = 165 cm in height and size 4 for < 165 cm. We conclude that predicting the optimal size of laryngeal mask airway for individual adult patients is complex. The best size selection strategies involve use of the size 4 and 5 laryngeal mask airways in adults.

TI  - Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on systemic vascular resistance and vasoconstrictor requirements during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We proposed that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy would alter systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during rewarming and increase the requirement for vasoactive drugs in the immediate post-bypass period. METHODS: Sixty-five sequential adult patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures requiring hypothermic (28 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were recruited. Sixty-two fitted the inclusion criteria of which 21 were receiving ACE inhibitors prior to surgery. SVR was calculated at 1 min intervals during the rewarming phase of hypothermic CPB. The use of vasoactive drugs during and immediately after termination of CPB was recorded. The doctor administering these drugs was unaware of the nature of the study. RESULTS: Mean SVR in the ACE group was 978 dyne/s per cm5 and in the control group was 1194 dyne/s per cm5 (P = 0.006). Mean arterial pressure was 48.8 mmHg in the ACE group and 56.3 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.004). There was a significant difference in vasoactive drug requirements between the groups (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in age, weight, body mass index, body surface area, theatre temperature, core temperature at which rewarming started, rate and time of rewarming, haematocrit on bypass or preoperative left ventricular function. CONCLUSION: Preoperative ACE inhibitor therapy decreases SVR during the rewarming phase of CPB and increases post-bypass vasoactive drug requirements.

TI  - Synchronization of ruminal degradation of supplemental carbohydrate with pasture nitrogen in lactating dairy cows.  
AB  - Twelve Holstein cows in early to midlactation (8 fitted with ruminal cannulas) were used to test the hypothesis that the synchronization of the rate of ruminal degradation of supplemental carbohydrate and N from fresh pasture would increase the amount of N retained for growth and milk production. A concentrate based on ground shelled corn was fed either at the time that pasture was fed at 0900 and 1700 h (synchronous) or 4 h after pasture was fed at 1300 and 2100 h (asynchronous). The crossover design included a 6-d adjustment period and a 10-d milk sampling period. Nitrogen balance was determined during the last 5 d of each period. Cows fed the synchronous diet had a lower mean ruminal pH. Peak ammonia concentration at 3 and 5 h after pasture feeding in the morning was reduced by approximately 33% of values obtained from cows fed the asynchronous diet. The diurnal pattern of blood urea N concentration was similar to that of ruminal ammonia, but mean daily concentrations of blood urea N did not differ between diets. Nitrogen retained for milk production and growth was not influenced by diet, and no differences in milk production, composition, or efficiency were observed. Based on changes in ruminal concentrations of ammonia, synchronous ruminal release of supplemental carbohydrate with pasture N appeared to improve the capture of ruminal N; however, these changes were transient and did not change the N status or performance of dairy cows.

TI  - Ca2+-inhibited non-inactivating K+ channels in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurones.  
AB  - 1. Whole-cell perforated-patch recording from cultured CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurones from neonatal rat hippocampus (20-22 C; [K+]o = 2.5 mM) revealed two previously recorded non-inactivating (sustained) K+ outward currents: a voltage-independent 'leak' current (Ileak) operating at all negative potentials, and, at potentials >= -60 mV, a time- and voltage-dependent 'M-current' (IK(M)). Both were inhibited by 1 mM Ba2+ or 10 microM oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M). In ruptured-patch recording using Ca2+-free pipette solution, Ileak was strongly enhanced, and was inhibited by 1 mM Ba2+ but unaffected by 0.5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 1 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 1-10 nM margatoxin. 2. Single channels underlying these currents were sought in cell-attached patch recordings. A single class of channels of conductance approximately 7 pS showing sustained activity at resting potential and above was identified. These normally had a very low open probability (Po < 0. 1), which, however, showed a dramatic and reversible increase (to about 0.9 at approximately 0 mV) following the removal of Ca2+ from the bath. Under these (Ca2+-free) conditions, single-channel Po showed both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent components on patch depolarization from resting potential. The mean activation curve was fitted by a modified Boltzmann equation. When tested, all channels were reversibly inhibited by addition of 10 microM Oxo-M to the bath solution. 3. The channels maintained their high Po in patches excised in inside-out mode into a Ca2+-free internal solution and were strongly inhibited by application of Ca2+ to the inner face of the membrane (IC50 = 122 nM); this inhibition was observed in the absence of MgATP, and therefore was direct and unrelated to channel phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. 4. Channels in patches excised in outside-out mode were blocked by 1 mM Ba2+ but were unaffected by 4-AP or TEA. 5. Channels in cell-attached patches were inhibited after single spikes, yielding inward ensemble currents lasting several hundred milliseconds. This was prevented in Ca2+-free solution, implying that it was due to Ca2+ entry. 6. The properties of these channels (block by internal Ca2+ and external Oxo-M and Ba2+, and the presence of both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent components in their Po/V relationship) show points of resemblance to those expected for channels associated with both Ileak and IK(M) components of the sustained macroscopic currents. For this reason we designate them Ksust ('sustained current') channels. Inhibition of these channels by Ca2+ entry during an action potential may account for some forms of Ca2+-dependent after-depolarization. Their high sensitivity to internal Ca2+ may provide a new, positive feedback mechanism for cell excitation operating at low (near-resting) [Ca2+]i.

TI  - Evidence of a genetic contribution to functional bowel disorder.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anecdotally, functional bowel disorders (FBD) such as the irritable bowel syndrome appears to cluster in some families, but no studies have investigated the heritability of FBD. We aimed to investigate the influence of heritable factors in FBD. METHODS: Same sex twin pairs enrolled in the Australian Twin Registry completed a structured interview that included questions related to symptoms consistent with FBD: abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, excessive gas or bloating, and nausea. Reasons for the occurrence of each symptom, including their physicians' diagnoses, were recorded. Lisrel 7.16 software was used to fit genetic models following standard procedures. RESULTS: Of the 686 individual twins from same-sex pairs, 33 (4.8%) had one or more symptoms diagnosed by a medical practitioner as functional bowel disorder. Complete data on this symptom scale was available for 186 monozygotic and 157 same sex dizygotic twin pairs. A model in which 56.9% (95% CI: 40.6-75.9%) of the variance was attributed to additive genetic variance, with the remaining 43.1% attributed to the individual's unique environment, closely fitted the data (chi2=0.01, df=4, p=1.0). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of the liability for FBD may be under genetic control.

TI  - Functional dental correlates of food properties in five Malagasy lemur species.  
AB  - Biomechanical explanations are fundamental to studies of functional dental morphology. Until recently foods were not classified in mechanical categories amenable to a rigorous examination of the fundamental physical relationship between teeth and foods. Fruit, insect and leaf categories, although descriptive, are mechanically heterogeneous. The diets of five Malagasy lemur taxa were described in terms of two mechanical properties, hardness and shear strength, in an earlier study (Yamashita, 1996b). In the present study, correlations between these two physical food properties and second molar tooth features of two lemur families are examined. Several relationships are hypothesized: 1) crest length is expected to be positively correlated with food shear strength; 2) the radius of curvature (r) of cusps is expected to be positively correlated with food hardness; and 3) basin area should increase relative to cusp radius as food hardness increases, and cusp-to-basin ratios should decrease with increasing food hardness. Two additional hypotheses address the debate concerning the relative influences of the most frequently eaten foods versus the most stressful foods in determining tooth form. The results of the predicted relationships are equivocal. 1) Crest length is negatively instead of positively correlated with strong foods. Crest lengths are correlated with quantities of leaf consumption, which are related to leaf shape more than to material composition. 2) As expected, r is positively correlated with food hardness and negatively with shear strength, but this applies to upper molar cusps only. Lower molar cusps complicate simple generalizations of relationships. 3) Hard foods are correlated with a tight fit of occluding cusps and basins instead of the expected loose fit. The most stressful foods eaten (hardest and strongest) have higher correlations with tooth features than the most frequently eaten foods. Several functional complexes can be identified. Hard food items are correlated with short cusps in lemurids, tight occlusal fit, small trigon and large talonid areas, and deep, acute basins. Large, shallow trigons, shallow, unrestricted talonids, and large upper molar basins are indicative of a diet of strong foods. These results demonstrate that some variation in tooth features is explicable with reference to mechanical properties of diet, although the relationships are complex.

TI  - The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait version: structure and content re-examined.  
AB  - Although the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a popular measure of anxiety, some previous research suggests that the trait scale may assess depression, as well as anxiety. The factor structure of the trait items was initially examined using factor analytic procedures. Confirmatory factor analytic methods suggested that a hierarchical solution best fit the data, with one overall factor and two lower order factors. The lower order subscales created from this factor solution were examined in a sample of individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the results offered good support for the notion that the trait scale of the STAI assesses depression, as well as anxiety. One set of items appeared to assess anxiety and worry, whereas the other assessed sadness and self-deprecation. The two subscales correlated differentially with other measures of anxiety and depression in a manner that was consistent with their content. Finally, diagnostic groups and controls could be meaningfully distinguished on these subscales. Implications for the use of this measure are discussed.

TI  - Nuclear magnetic resonance structure of d(GCATATGATAG). d(CTATCATATGC): a consensus sequence for promoters recognized by sigma K RNA polymerase.  
AB  - The three-dimensional structure of d(GCATATGATAG).d(CTATCATATGC), from the promoter region of a gene regulating sporulation in Bacillus subtilis mother cells, was determined utilizing two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (2D NOE) and double-quantum-filtered COSY (2QF-COSY) spectra. To minimize the effect of methods used to obtain restraints and refine structure, several variables were studied. Interproton distance bounds were calculated very conservatively by running the complete relaxation matrix program MARDIGRAS hundreds of times using 2D NOE spectra for exchangeable and for nonexchangeable protons at different mixing times, assuming different overall correlation times and different starting structures. The 435 distance restraints were used with two different structural refinement methods: restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) and restrained Monte Carlo calculations (rMC). Refinement using different procedures and starting structures resulted in essentially the same structure (<0.8 A rmsd), indicating that the structure is defined by experimental restraints and not the refinement method or variables used. R factors indicate the structures fit the experimental NOE data very well. Some helical parameters, notably large negative X displacement, are characteristic of A-DNA, but others are characteristic of B-DNA. As with TG.CA steps in other duplex DNA sequences studied in our laboratory, the two TG.CA steps have a positive roll, with T6-G7 exhibiting the largest, and consequently a bent helix axis. The converged structure represents a time-averaged structure. However, multiple conformations, especially in deoxyriboses, were evident from vicinal coupling constants obtained from quantitative simulations of 2QF-COSY cross-peaks and from persistent inconsistencies in experimental distances due to nonlinear conformational averaging.

TI  - Molecular characterization and sequence of a methionine biosynthetic locus from Pseudomonas syringae.  
AB  - Two methionine biosynthetic genes in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, metX and metW, were isolated, sequenced, and evaluated for their roles in methionine biosynthesis and bacterial fitness on leaf surfaces. The metXW locus was isolated on a 1.8-kb DNA fragment that was required for both methionine prototrophy and wild-type epiphytic fitness. Sequence analysis identified two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs), and in vitro transcription-translation experiments provided strong evidence that the ORFs encode proteins with the predicted molecular masses of 39 and 22.5 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of MetX (39 kDa) showed homology to several known and putative homoserine O-acetyltransferases. This enzyme is the first enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway of fungi, gram-negative bacteria of the genus Leptospira, and several gram-positive bacterial genera. Both metX and metW were required for methionine biosynthesis, and transcription from both genes was not repressed by methionine. MetW (22.5 kDa) did not show significant homology to any known protein, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic methionine biosynthetic enzymes. Several classes of methionine auxotrophs, including metX and metW mutants, exhibit reduced fitness on leaf surfaces, indicating a requirement for methionine prototrophy in wild-type epiphytic fitness. This requirement is enhanced under environmentally stressful conditions, suggesting a role for methionine prototrophy in bacterial stress tolerance.

AB  - In the superconducting cyclotron used for neutron therapy at Harper Hospital, space limitations prevented the use of a simple conventional light localizing system, employing a single mirror and a light source. The superconducting magnet coil is close to the neutron producing target and the vacuum window separating the acceleration chamber from atmospheric pressure is situated approximately 56 cm from this target. Therefore, the light localizing system must be designed to incorporate lenses, mirrors, an optical fiber light pipe and adjustment motors, in order to make the system compact enough to fit in the available space and to allow easy access for adjustment and alignment. The design of the light localizing system is explained in detail.

AB  - Two companies provide custom-made pressure garments to clients with burn scars at Westmead Hospital. This prospective study was completed in order to make objective decisions about which garments were most appropriate and cost effective to provide to clients. Issues such as cost, durability, fit and client preferences were investigated. Data were collected from 43 clients; at the time of initial fitting, at a follow-up appointment 4-6 weeks later, and at the time one of the garments required replacement. One Second Skin and one Jobst garment were provided to each client and the garments were compared using therapists' evaluation and clients' perspectives on a number of variables. Second Skin garments had significantly more favourable results on the variables of time for delivery, fit at follow-up, garment design, quality of fabric and seams, overall satisfaction and garment preference for ongoing wear. On all other variables there was no significant difference between the garments. Second Skin provided the most optimal and appropriate option for pressure garments in the management of burn scars for our clients.

TI  - The mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects of viability and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster.  
AB  - The empirical distributions of the average viability and fitness of mutation accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed using minimum distance estimation. Data come from two different experimental designs where mutations were allowed to accumulate: 1) in copies of chromosome II protected from natural selection and recombination (viability: Mukai et al., 1972; Ohnishi, 1977; fitness: Houle et al., 1992), 2) in inbred lines derived from the same isogenic stock (viability: Fernandez & Lopez-Fanjul, 1996; fitness: this paper). Information from all data sets converged, indicating that the mutational rates were small, about 1% for viability and 3% for fitness. For both traits, the rate of mutational decline appears to be smaller than suggested by previous studies (about one-fifth of the latter), the average mutational effect was neither severe nor very slight, ranging from -0.1 to -0.3, and the distribution of mutant effects was, at most, slightly leptokurtic. Therefore, the mutational load in natural populations is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than previously thought (as based upon analyses conditional to estimates of the mutational decline of viability or fitness that appear to be biased upward). Over 95% of the mutational variance of each trait was contributed by non-slightly deleterious mutations (absolute homozygous effect larger than 0.03 or 0.1, depending on the data set considered) occurring at a rate not higher than 0.025 per haploid genome and generation. Our data suggest that most deleterious mutations affecting fitness act mainly through a single component-trait.

TI  - 2-, 5-, and 6-Halo-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridines: synthesis, affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and molecular modeling.  
AB  - 3-(2(S)-Azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (A-85380) has been identified recently as a ligand with high affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here we report the synthesis and in vitro nAChR binding of a series of 10 pyridine-modified analogues of A-85380. The novel compounds feature a halogen substituent at position 2, 5, or 6 of the 3-pyridyl fragment. Those with the substituents at position 5 or 6, as well as the 2-fluoro analogue, possess subnanomolar affinity for nAChRs in membranes from rat brain. For these ligands, Ki values range from 11 to 210 pM, as measured by competition with (+/-)-[3H]epibatidine. In contrast, 2-chloro, 2-bromo, and 2-iodo analogues exhibit substantially lower affinity. AM1 quantum chemical calculations demonstrate that the bulky substituents at position 2 cause notable changes in the molecular geometry. The high-affinity members of the series and (+)-epibatidine display a tight fit superposition of low-energy stable conformers. The new ligands with high affinity for nAChRs may be of interest as pharmacological probes, potential medications, and candidates for developing radiohalogenated tracers to study nAChRs.

TI  - Case management and supported employment: a good fit.  
AB  - Individuals with severe disabilities have often been denied the full range of vocational opportunities. Because of discrimination and oppression, and false beliefs regarding their skills, capacities, capabilities, and interests, individuals with disabilities have often been relegated to nonwork activities or sheltered work opportunities. Passage of legislation, such as the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1984 and Title VI, Part C of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, in combination with systems change grants funded through Title III of the Rehabilitation Act, provided the basis for the initiation of a series of federal- and state-funded demonstration projects designed to provide opportunities and supports for individuals with severe or significant disabilities to work at competitive sites in the community. This model of vocational services, called supported employment, while initially conceived as a vocational program for individuals with mental retardation, has been modified to successfully provide services to individuals with mental illness, acquired brain injury, autism, cerebral palsy, physical disabilities, and other disabilities. A key to the success of these programs is the complementary working relationship between the case manager and the job coach. While there may be some overlap in what each brings to the person with a disability, each professional plays distinctive and critical roles in the carrying out of supported employment.

AB  - To examine the association of level of functional fitness to demographic, health, and life behavioral or social factors, cross sectional data were obtained for 737 persons aged 60 years or older, and who were independently living in the community.  Functional fitness was measured with a functional fitness test containing 4 task items: standing, walking, hand performance, and self-care performance. Among the demographic factors, statistically significant associations with functional fitness were found for age in both male and female and for the presence of spouse in male. Health status, previous or present history of circulatory diseases and musculo-skeletal diseases were significantly associated with lower levels of functional fitness in male, and previous or present history of musculo-skeletal diseases and presence of higher obesity associated with lower fitness level in female. With life behaviors, men who had habitual exercise activities and women who had no habitual nap but habitual exercise activities and frequent out-of-home activities showed significantly higher fitness level than their counterparts. These results suggest that level of functional fitness in independently living aged people in the community was significantly associated with the presence of spouse, history of circulatory and musculo-skeletal diseases, and habitual exercise activities in males; and with the history of musculo-skeletal diseases, obesity, and habitual exercise activities, napping, and frequent out-of-home activities in females.

TI  - Oral bioavailability of hyperforin from hypericum extracts in rats and human volunteers.  
AB  - Validated analytical methods suitable for determining hyperforin in plasma after administration of alcoholic Hypericum perforatum extracts containing hyperforin are described. After oral administration of 300 mg/kg Hypericum extract (WS 5572, containing 5% hyperforin) to rats maximum plasma levels of approximately 370 ng/ml (approx. 690 nM) were reached after 3 h, as quantified by a HPLC and UV detection method. Estimated half-life and clearance values were 6 h and 70 ml/min/kg respectively. Since therapeutic doses of Hypericum extracts are much lower than that used in rats, a more sensitive LC/MS/MS method was developed. The lower limit of quantification of this method was 1 ng/ml. Using this method, plasma levels of hyperforin could be followed for up to 24 h in healthy volunteers after administration of film coated tablets containing 300 mg hypericum extracts representing 14.8 mg hyperforin. The maximum plasma levels of approximately 150 ng/ml (approx. 280 nM) were reached 3.5 h after administration. Half-life and mean residence time were 9 and 12 h respectively. Hyperforin pharmacokinetics were linear up to 600 mg of the extract. Increasing the doses to 900 or 1200 mg of extract resulted in lower Cmax and AUC values than those expected from linear extrapolation of data from lower doses. Plasma concentration curves in volunteers fitted well in an open two-compartment model. In a repeated dose study, no accumulation of hyperforin in plasma was observed. Using the observed AUC values from the repeated dose study, the estimated steady state plasma concentrations of hyperforin after 3 x 300 mg/day of the extract, i.e., after normal therapeutic dose regimen, was approximately 100 ng/ml (approx. 180 nM).

TI  - Non-steady state population kinetics of intravenous phenytoin.  
AB  - This observational study explored the effects of demographics, sickness, and polypharmacy on the non-steady state population pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenytoin. One hundred fifteen patients were studied. Models were developed using the NONMEM program with hybrid first-order conditional estimation. A Michaelis-Menten model with delayed induction was preferred over a Michaelis-Menten model without induction, a Michaelis-Menten model with immediate induction, or a linear model with delayed induction. When the data were fit to a Michaelis-Menten model with delayed induction, the volume of distribution (Vd) was found to depend on weight and serum albumin. The Vd was estimated to be 0.95 l/kg, assuming an albumin level of 3 g/dl. The Michaelis-Menten constant (km) was estimated to be 7.9 mg/l. The baseline maximum metabolic rate was 580 mg/day for a 70-kg patient. The average time to onset of induction was 59.5 hours. If a fever developed after induction began, it increased the extent of induction. This model was evaluated retrospectively in 26 additional patients, yielding a mean prediction error of -0.4 mg/l (-3.0-2.2 mg/l) and a mean absolute prediction error of 4.7 mg/l (3.2-6.2 mg/l) based on two-level feedback. Given the large interindividual variances in maximum metabolic rate, phenytoin levels should be measured frequently.

The aortas, opened anteriorly and pinned flat with the luminal surface facing up, were analysed using Mocha Imaging software. The circumference was measured at intervals of 10 mm and fitted with a third order polynomial function. Taper was calculated for three segments within each aorta as the angle produced by the slope of the decrease in circumference with length. The percent surface area covered by fatty streaks correlated strongly to the coefficients of the polynomial function, while the raised lesions showed a significant increase with an increase in taper angles in the different segments. The results suggest taper plays a role in the distribution of both fatty streaks and raised lesions, however, the nature of the cause and effect remains to be determined.

AB  - Although intermediate metabolism is known to follow circadian rhythms, little information is available on the variations in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities during the 24-h period, and there is also a lack of adequate statistical analysis. Here, adult male rats were fed ad libitum and kept at 21 degrees C under 12:12-h light-dark cycles. They were killed in batches every 3 h over a 24-h period. Lipase activities were determined in plasma and fresh homogenates of epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Plasma insulin, corticosterone, glucose, triacylglycerol (TAG), cholesterol, glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and liver and muscle glycogen were determined. Cosinor analysis was used to evaluate the presence (significance of fit of cosine curve to data and variance explained by rhythm) and characteristics of possible circadian rhythms [acrophase (phi), mesor, and amplitude]. Statistically significant circadian rhythms were detected for 1) all metabolites studied, except TAG, cholesterol, and liver HL activity; 2) LPL and HL activity in plasma (both phi in light phase); and 3) LPL activity in all tissues studied (phi: heart in light phase; skeletal muscle, IBAT, and EWAT in dark phase). Liver also showed a circadian rhythm of LPL activity, with phi near that in plasma. These findings demonstrate for the first time that, in physiological conditions, LPL activities in plasma and various tissues, including liver, and HL activity in plasma follow circadian rhythms. Their metabolic significance is discussed.
