TI  - Biochemical composition of benign thyroid cyst fluid.  
AB  - Although the availability of thyroid cyst fluid is easy by fine-needle aspiration, less is known about the biochemical composition of thyroid cyst fluid. The authors have, therefore, determined the biochemical composition of 18 benign thyroid cyst fluid specimens. They found that the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the concentrations of total protein, total bilirubin, and uric acid were highly increased in thyroid cyst fluid specimens when compared with normal human serum specimens. The concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides in cyst fluid were within normal serum limits. Selenium (Se) concentrations in most cyst fluids were low. Moreover, there was no correlation between Se and other biochemical parameters. Protein electrophoresis of cyst fluid specimens yielded high concentrations of alpha 1 and especially alpha 2 globulin fractions indicating an inflammation. The concentrations or activities of biochemical analytes were not significantly different in pure and mixed cysts. Those parameters were also not significantly different between cyst fluids of different colors. The gross appearance of the fluid and the presence of certain biochemical analytes were consistent with a hemorrhagic origin of most of the cyst fluid specimens. However, some biochemical markers indicate that autolysis or necrosis of thyroid tissue may also contribute the composition of thyroid cyst fluid. The reason for lower Se concentration in the thyroid cyst fluid may be the lower Se concentration in the Turkish population. These results also suggest that the fluid color or nature of cyst, e.g., pure or mixed cyst, is not a main determinant of biochemical composition of benign thyroid cyst fluid.

TI  - Strain-related differences in Sephadex bead-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in rats.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare Sephadex G-200 (Sephadex)-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and pulmonary eosinophilia among some rat strains. MATERIALS: Sprague-Dawley (SD), Brown-Norway (BN), Fischer 344 (Fischer), Lewis and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used. METHODS: Sephadex (0.5 mg/animal) was intravenously administered on days 0, 2 and 5. Measurement of AHR using serotonin and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on day 7. RESULTS: The Lewis strain exhibited significant AHR to Sephadex but the BN, Fischer and WKY strains did not. Additionally, the degree of AHR in Lewis rats was smaller than in SD rats throughout the study. Eosinophils in BAL fluid, however, increased in each strain, and the magnitude of the response was BN > Lewis > WKY > Fischer. Both the AHR and pulmonary eosinophilia in Lewis rats were inhibited by dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg, p.o. x3). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the Lewis rat is a useful strain for analysis of the mechanism of Sephadex-induced AHR and airway inflammation.

TI  - Acidic amino acid accumulation by rat choroid plexus during development.  
AB  - Acidic amino acid accumulation by the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles was investigated using 1, 2, 3 week and adult (7-10 weeks old) rats. The accumulation from both blood and CSF sides of the choroid plexuses were investigated. The uptake from blood side was studied using the bilateral in situ brain perfusion, and time-dependent uptake profiles (2, 10, 20, and 30 min) of 14C-labelled aspartate, glutamate, and NMDA were measured. [3H]Mannitol was also included in perfusion fluid as a baseline for [14C]amino acid uptake into choroidal tissue. Uptake of [14C]aspartate and [14C]glutamate declined with age, while [14C]NMDA showed no significant uptake at any age. Twenty min [3H]mannitol uptake in the 1-week-old rat was significantly greater than the adult (P < 0.05). The K(m) for [14C]aspartate and [14C]glutamate obtained from multiple time uptake profiles also showed reduction with development but it was greater than that for mannitol. [14C]Aspartate declined from 69.8 +/- 21.1 microliters.min-1.g-1 in the neonate to 40.6 +/- 4.0 microliters.min-1.g-1 in the adult (P < 0.05), while glutamate showed a sharper decline from 78.9 +/- 24.2 microliters.min-1.g-1 to 17.7 +/- 5.4 microliters.min-1.g-1 (P < 0.01). Accumulation of 14C-labelled aspartate and glutamate by the choroid plexus from CSF side was also measured using ventriculo-cisternal perfusion. The accumulation in the adult was found to be 2-3 times greater than that in the neonatal rat (P < 0.05) for both amino acids. The uptake from either side was found to be saturable, stereospecific, not inhibited by neutral amino acid analogues, and shared by both aspartate and glutamate.

TI  - Neurologic outcome with hemorrhagic hypotension after closed head trauma in rats: effect of early versus delayed conservative fluid therapy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined (1) whether two previously reported, well-established models in rats, one a model of hemorrhagic hypotension and the other a model of closed head trauma, could be combined to evaluate neurologic outcome when hemorrhage occurs subsequent to head injury, and (2) the ability of the traditional, conservative approach to fluid therapy (3 mL of intravenous fluid for 1 mL of blood loss) to reverse the detrimental effects of hemorrhagic hypotension after closed head trauma. In addition, two strategies of fluid therapy (early and delayed) were examined. METHODS: Fifty-six Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into five groups with head injury at time 0 in groups 3 to 5, hemorrhage at 1 hour in groups 1, 2, 4, and 5, and intravenous fluid at 15 minutes (groups 2 and 5) or 60 minutes (groups 1 and 4) after hemorrhage. Head injury was delivered using a weight-drop impact of 0.5 J onto the closed cranium. Neurologic Severity Score (NSS) was determined at 1 hour (just before hemorrhage) and at 4 hours. RESULTS: NSS at 1 hour did not differ between groups 3 to 5 (15.5 (9-24) to 16 (2-21), median (range)). The amount of bleeding did not differ between groups during the first 15 minutes of hemorrhage (2.8 +/- 0.8 to 3.7 +/- 2.0 mL, mean +/- SD). After 60 minutes, cumulative blood loss in the delayed fluid therapy groups was less (3.1 +/- 1.13 mL in group 1 and 4.25 +/- 2.39 mL in group 4) than in the early fluid therapy groups (7.73 +/- 4.41 mL in group 2 and 6.85 +/- 2.36 mL in group 5) (analysis of variance, p < 0.01). The NSS of group 3 (head injury only) improved at 4 hours after injury (12 (5-20)), whereas the NSS of groups 4 and 5 (head injury followed by hemorrhage) deteriorated (24 (17-25) and 19.5 (9-25), respectively) (Kruskal-Wallis test,p < 0.05). In all the hemorrhage groups, fluid therapy failed to restore blood pressure to prehemorrhage levels. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the two individual models of hemorrhagic hypotension and closed head trauma in rats can be combined to evaluate outcome when hemorrhage occurs subsequent to head injury. Furthermore, traditional, conservative fluid therapy, whether early or delayed, failed to restore blood pressure or to improve NSS when hemorrhage occurred after head injury. Blood loss was greater with early fluid therapy whether or not head injury was present.

TI  - [Re-expansion pulmonary edema after emergency thoracotomy for spontaneous hemopneumothorax: a case report]  
AB  - A 44-year-old man was admitted to out hospital complaining of chest pain and increasing dyspnea. Chest X-ray on admission revealed a collapsed lung and an air fluid line in the left hemothorax. Following blood transfusion because of 2,000 ml hemorrhagic pleural fluid, emergent surgery was carried out. At operation, a bleeding artery originating from the apex of the thoracic cavity and a bulla on the upper lobe were noticed. After extubation of endotracheal tube, he offered severe dyspnea with hypoxia. The chest X-ray showed figure of pulmonary edema in the left lower lobe. Patient was managed by oxygen, steroid, and urinastatin. On the 3rd operative day, pulmonary edema was disappeared. It should be kept in the mind that the re-expansion pulmonary edema occurred in patients with spontaneous hemopneumothorax of less than 3 days of duration.

TI  - The role of vitreoretinal surgery in the treatment of posttraumatic macular hole.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if vitreoretinal surgery is successful in closing traumatic macular holes and subsequently improving visual acuity. Blunt trauma may result in a macular hole when it causes traumatic separation of the vitreous from the retina, contusion necrosis, or subfoveal hemorrhage. Like idiopathic macular holes, traumatic macular holes are surrounded by a ring of subretinal fluid and result in severely diminished visual acuity. METHODS: Fourteen eyes with full-thickness posttraumatic macular holes were treated. The patients ages ranged from 15 years to 36 years (mean, 22 years). Preoperative best corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to 20/50 (mean, 20/80). A pars plana vitrectomy and posterior hyaloid dissection were performed, followed by complete fluid-gas exchange and instillation of 0.1 mL of platelet concentrate just over the macular hole. A final flushing with 25% sulfur hexafluoride was done. The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 28 months (average, 13 months). RESULTS: Successful anatomic macular hole closure was achieved 6 months after surgery in 13 years (92.86%). Visual acuity improved four or more lines on the Snellen chart within 6 weeks after surgery in every eye with a closed hole; a final visual acuity of 20/20 was achieved in two eyes (15.3%). The mean postoperative visual acuity was 20/30. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted, and the lens remained clear in all eyes during the follow up period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that intraoperative application of platelet concentrate in combination with vitrectomy may be useful in managing posttraumatic full-thickness macular holes, thus improving anatomic and visual outcomes. The greater recovery of visual acuity obtained in this study compared with that obtained in other series of idiopathic macular holes could be related to the young age of the patients with traumatic macular holes and the early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Intrarenal production of angiotensin II.  
AB  - The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in the paracrine regulation of renal hemodynamics and tubular transport function. Much of the intrarenal angiotensin II (ANG II) is formed locally as evidenced by intrarenal ANG II contents that are much greater than can be explained from the circulating ANG II concentration. Intrarenal ANG II is formed from systemically delivered ANG I and from intrarenally formed ANG I derived from systemically delivered angiotensinogen as well as locally synthesized angiotensionogen. There is a regional distribution of intrarenal ANG II in that the medullary content per gram of tissue is four to five times higher than the cortical content. In addition, most of the cortical ANG II is compartmentalized in the renal interstitial fluid and in the tubular fluid. Proximal tubule cells contain all the components of the renin-angiotensin system necessary for synthesis and secretion of ANG II. Proximal tubule concentrations of ANG II as well as ANG I and angiotensinogen support the concept that the proximal tubule cells secrete ANG II or precursors of ANG II into the tubular fluid. The intratubular concentrations of ANG II are in the nanomolar range, indicating a substantial capability to influence luminal ANG II receptors on the tubule cell membranes. Thus, much of the ANG II-dependent actions on tubular transport functions could be due to specific effects of locally synthesized ANG II on luminal ANG II receptors. Experimental evidence shows that the intratubular ANG II concentrations are regulated independently of the circulating concentrations, but the specific mechanisms responsible remain to be delineated.

TI  - Lung surfactant in a cystic fibrosis animal model: increased alveolar phospholipid pool size without altered composition and surface tension function in cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive pulmonary dysfunction is a characteristic symptom of cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with functional impairment and biochemical alterations of surfactant phospholipids in the airways. However, the fundamental question of whether surfactant alterations in the CF lung are secondary to the pulmonary damage or are present before initiation of chronic infection and inflammation has yet to be resolved in patients with cystic fibrosis but can now be addressed in CF mice that exhibit the basic defect in the airways. A study was therefore undertaken to investigate the pool sizes, composition, and function of lung surfactant in the non-infected cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mouse. METHODS: The amount and composition of phospholipid classes and phosphatidylcholine molecular species were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lavaged lungs by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Surfactant protein A (SP-A) levels in BAL fluid were determined by ELISA and surfactant for functional measurements was isolated from BAL fluid by differential ultracentrifugation. Equilibrium and minimal surface tension of surfactant was assessed by the pulsating bubble surfactometer technique. MF1, BALB/c, C57/BL6, and C3H/He mice served as controls. RESULTS: BAL fluid of cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice contained 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.16) mumol phospholipid and 259 (239 to 279) ng SP-A. BAL fluid of MF1, BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C3H/He mice contained 0.69 (0.63 to 0.75), 0.50 (0.42 to 0.57), 0.52 (0.40 to 0.64), and 0.45 (0.27 to 0.63) mumol phospholipid, respectively. After correction for the different body weights of mouse strains, phospholipid levels in BAL fluid of cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice were increased by 64 (52 to 76)%, 60 (39 to 89)%, 72 (45 to 113)%, and 92 (49 to 163)%, respectively, compared with controls. The amount of SP-A in BAL fluid and the composition of phospholipid as well as phosphatidylcholine molecular species in BAL fluid and lung tissue was unchanged in cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice compared with controls. The increase in phospholipids in BAL fluid of cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice resulted from an increased fraction of large aggregates which exhibited normal surface tension function. CONCLUSION: In cftrm1HGU/m1HGU mice surfactant homeostasis is perturbed by an increased phospholipid pool in the alveolar compartment.

TI  - Endothelin-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages in systemic sclerosis.  
AB  - Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent fibroblast/smooth muscle cells mitogen, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis lung disease (SSc). Since monocytes and macrophages are thought to be activated in SSc, we hypothesized that alveolar macrophages (AM) and their precursors blood monocytes from patients with SSc produced more ET-1 than cells from healthy subjects. ET-1 and big ET-1 concentrations were measured in plasma, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and in cell culture supernatants from monocytes and alveolar macrophages derived from 13 patients with definite SSc with lung involvement and from 10 control subjects. Plasma and BAL fluid ET-1 and big ET-1 levels were similar in both controls and patients with SSc. ET-1 and big ET-1 concentrations in unstimulated alveolar macrophage supernatants were similar in both groups. In contrast, LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages from patients with SSc secreted higher amounts of ET-1 and big ET-1 than control subjects. ET-1 and big ET-1 concentrations in monocyte supernatants (either LPS-stimulated or not) were not different in patients and controls. These results show that AM from patients with SSc are hyperresponsive to LPS in vitro in terms of ET-1 and big ET-1 production and suggest that AM could participate in vivo in the overproduction of this potentially profibrotic mediator in patients with SSc.

TI  - Same day drainage and removal of a giant ovarian cyst.  
AB  - PURPOSE: An unusual case of a giant ovarian cyst was successfully anaesthetized with a combination of epidural followed by general anaesthesia. The method was chosen to avoid circulatory depression and re-expansion pulmonary oedema in removal of a giant tumour in a woman who did not understand the nature of her disease. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 58-yr-old woman (107.6 kg, 150 cm and abdominal girth: 163.5 cm) was admitted for removal of a giant ovarian cyst. There was gross-pitting oedema of both legs and an elevated diaphragm but no pleural effusion. She did not understand the severity of her disease. It was decided to drain the cyst gradually, followed by total surgical removal on the same day. An epidural catheter was inserted at the L3-4 interspace with the patient in the left lateral position and, under epidural anaesthesia, 44.3 L fluid were drained over two hours without producing circulatory depression or pulmonary oedema. General anaesthesia was induced, with the patient in the supine position, by slow injection of 10 mg midazolam, 100 micrograms fentanyl and inhalation of nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen, and maintained with adding epidural block using lidocaine 1.5% and bupivacaine 0.5%, and sevoflurane 0.4 to 0.8%. During surgery, the volume of infused fluid was carefully controlled with central venous pressure monitoring. Ulinastatin, a protease inhibitor, was infused to prevent pulmonary oedema. No circulatory depression nor pulmonary oedema occurred perioperatively. CONCLUSION: For the removal of a giant ovarian cyst, slow drainage over two hours under epidural anaesthesia may safely precede later removal of the cyst on the same day under general anaesthesia.

TI  - Changes in LDH isozyme pattern in uterine fluid of mice during early pregnancy.  
AB  - The total LDH activity in the uterine fluid of mice shows a rising trend from the first day after mating (DAM-1) to the seventh day after mating (DAM-7). This suggests that LDH activity increases as gestation progresses. During early pregnancy, M-isozymes of LDH show a predominance from DAM-1 to DAM-3 in the uterine luminal fluid of mice, while H-isozyme shows a rising level from DAM-5 (implantation day) and attains a maximum level at DAM-7 (the post-implantation period). Such shift of M-isozymes into H-isozymes of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) during pre-implantation (DAM-3) to post-implantation (DAM-7) period changes the uterine luminal environment from anaerobic to aerobic condition which is more conducive for the normal development, implantation and survival of the growing blastocyst.

TI  - Human liver transplant perfusate: an abundant source of donor liver-associated leukocytes.  
AB  - In vitro studies designed to examine the mechanisms of immune tolerance after liver transplantation in humans have been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of donor liver-associated leukocytes (LALs). We have investigated whether the ex vivo perfusion of donor livers releases a population of LALs that can be readily retrieved from the waste fluid. The mean number of cells recovered after Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient separation was 2.6 +/- 0.5 x 10(8) cells, with a viability of 94% +/- 2%. The perfusate lymphocytes comprised mainly T cells (39% +/- 2%) with a very low CD4/CD8 ratio and natural killer (NK) cells (56% +/- 6%) with an increase in the proportion of the CD3-CD56+CD16- subset. The activation marker CD69 was present on the majority of the perfusate lymphocytes. These are the phenotypic characteristics that have been previously reported for lymphocytes isolated from hepatic sinusoids. In mixed lymphocyte reactions, the perfusate cells showed a marked increase in the ability to stimulate allogeneic responder cells, resulting in 353% +/- 78% (P = .003) greater incorporation of [3H]thymidine in responder cells when compared with stimulation by donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results show that large numbers of viable donor lymphocytes can be readily isolated from the liver perfusate solution. These cells have the characteristics of liver-associated lymphocytes with a predominance of activated NK and CD8+ T cells. This population can now be used in in vitro assays to elucidate the influence of donor leukocytes on the development of graft acceptance.

METHOD: Using ultrasound biomicroscopy, we examined a patient with transient shallow anterior chamber after vitreous surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: On the day after surgery, slit-lamp examination disclosed a shallow anterior chamber that persisted for 1 week and deepened thereafter. Ultrasound biomicroscopy 5 days postoperatively disclosed a narrow angle in the peripheral anterior chamber and supraciliary fluid. At 14 days postoperatively, suprachoroidal fluid could not be detected, and the angle was wide. CONCLUSION: The shallow anterior chamber in this patient was caused by supraciliary fluid after vitreous surgery.

TI  - Ethanol inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase transcription and post-transcriptional processes in vivo.  
AB  - The effects of ethanol (ETOH) on post-transcriptional regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vivo has not been demonstrated. We examined the effect of ETOH on iNOS mRNA, protein, and the production of the nitrate and nitrite anion (RNI) in rat lung alveolar macrophages (AM) in vivo when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DB-cAMP). Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250 g) (n = 5-7/gp) were given intratracheal LPS (0.6 mg/kg) or DB-cAMP (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) 30 min after ETOH (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)) or phosphate-buffered sterile saline (PBS) (5 ml/kg, ip) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC 10 mg/kg, intratracheally) or 15 min after diethyl dithiocarbamate (DETC) (5 mg/kg, intratracheally). At selected times after administration of LPS or DB-cAMP, the animals were anesthetized, the lungs with the heart attached were removed and the lungs subjected to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  The BAL fluid was assayed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and RNI. The BAL fluid AM were isolated and analyzed for iNOS mRNA and protein with competitor-equalized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blots, respectively. The ex vivo incubates of AM were assayed for RNI and TNF alpha. LPS and DB-cAMP each increased iNOS mRNA and protein in AM and RNI in the BAL fluid and ex vivo incubates of AM. However, the peak of the increase of iNOS mRNA occurred at 2 hr for DB-cAMP and 4 to 6 hr for LPS. Only LPS increased the concentrations of TNF alpha in BAL fluid and ex vivo incubates of AM. ETOH attenuated LPS-mediated up-regulation of iNOS mRNA and TNF alpha and iNOS protein and RNI produced by the AM. In contrast, pretreatment of rats with ETOH did not affect DB-cAMP-mediated increases of iNOS mRNA in AM at any time but suppressed the amount of iNOS protein and RNI produced in DB-cAMP-stimulated AM. DETC, but not PDTC, attenuated LPS-mediated up-regulation of iNOS mRNA without effects on that produced by DB-cAMP. Since ETOH and DETC, but not PDTC, suppressed LPS-mediated but not DB-cAMP-mediated transcription of iNOS, we conclude that two distinct pathways exist for induction of iNOS mRNA by these agonists. ETOH and DETC may inhibit the LPS-mediated activation pathway by acting as antioxidants. Also, since ETOH inhibited DB-cAMP-mediated increases in iNOS protein without affecting iNOS mRNA ETOH also acts at a post-transcriptional or translational site to inhibit iNOS protein in rat AM in vivo.

TI  - Role of actin filament organization in cell volume and ion channel regulation.  
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton is an intracellular structure, which is involved in the onset and control of cell shape and function. In order for this relevant network to control its own and thus cell volume, specific interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and ion channel regulation controlling intracellular salt and water homeostasis may be invoked. The hypotonic shock-induced, cell volume regulatory decrease (RVD) of most eukaryotic cells is a particularly useful example, as it is initiated and regulated by concerted processes involving both adaptive changes in actin filament organization and bulk fluid extrusion triggered by saline movement and the consequent decrease in cell water. The onset of RVD is linked to the selective activation of osmotically-sensitive ion channels and other relevant ion transport mechanisms involved in the net ionic movement from the cytosol. Such regulatory processes, entailing effector changes in actin filament organization which target the plasma membrane, are largely unknown. In this report, recent studies are summarized implicating dynamic changes in gel properties of the actin cytoskeleton as the effector mechanism in the regulation of ion channel activity, and thus cell volume, in human melanoma cells. Based on the characterization of the hypotonic cell volume regulatory response of human melanoma cells devoid of a functional actin-binding protein (ABP-280, a filamin homolog) and their genetically rescued counterpart transfected with a functional ABP, a hypothesis is raised which is consistent with a regulatory "sensory" mechanism based on the ability of actin networks to respond to changes in the intracellular water-salt homeostasis, which in turn effects signals controlling membrane function, including ion channel activity.

AB  - The present study was aimed at determining whether the concurrent availability of highly palatable fluids (i.e., a chocolate-flavored drink and a sucrose solution) would alter voluntary ethanol drinking in selectively bred, alcohol-preferring sP and -nonpreferring sNP rats. Ethanol intake occurred under the three-bottle, free choice regimen between 10% (v/v) ethanol solution, tap water, and the palatable fluids for 24 h per day. When rats were given ethanol and water, but no alternative fluids, mean ethanol intake in sP rats ranged between 6 and 7 g/kg per day and mean preference ratio was steadily higher than 80%, whereas mean ethanol intake and preference ratio in sNP rats were constantly lower than 0.3 g/kg and 5%, respectively. In the presence of either the chocolate-flavored drink or sucrose solution, both prepared as isocaloric to the ethanol solution, absolute ethanol intake in sP rats declined by 60-70%; similarly, the preference ratio was reduced by 80-90%. Ethanol intake in sNP rats was unaffected by the simultaneous presentation of either palatable fluids. The results of the present study closely replicate those previously reported in genetically selected, ethanol-preferring HAD rats; however, they differ from those of ethanol-preferring P rats, which were reported to maintain high levels of ethanol intake and preference in the presence of highly palatable fluids. These results are discussed in terms of a) an alternative reinforcement partially substituting for the reinforcing properties of ethanol in sP rats, resulting in a less urgent need of ethanol, and b) genetic animal models of alcoholism diverging in some neurochemical and behavioral traits (e.g., response to the presentation of palatable fluids), which might parallel the different types of alcoholism observed in humans.

TI  - Comparison of commercial isotonic fluids intravenously administered to rehydrate fasted bullocks.  
AB  - Holstein bullocks were used in this study to compare the effectiveness of five commercial parenteral fluids (saline IS, Hartmann's IH, 5%-glucose 5G, Ringers IR, and 1/2 Ringer's and 2.5% glucose combination solutions RG) in correcting the disturbances associated with dehydration induced by fasting for 48 hr. These five commercial fluids (30 ml/kg) were given to bullocks with dehydration induced by fasting for 48 hr. Arterial and venous blood samples were taken before fasting, and at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 min, and 24 hr after initiation of fluid administration. Fasting for 48 hr induced significant reductions in body weight and relative plasma volume (rPV), of approximately 7.72 and 21.93%, respectively. During the administration period, rPV showed a progressive increase from approximately 88.1% after fasting to 113.0% with no significantly differences between groups. A rapid decrease of rPV when fluid administration has been finished was observed in the 5G and RG groups. The results of the fluid administration trial showed that the 1/2 Ringer's and 2.5% glucose combination solution inhibited the acidification of the blood, produced no change in the electrolyte balance of serum, and induced a proper reabsorption rate of glucose in the renals, and was therefore considered the best choice for the rehydration of adult cattle which have had no appetite for over 2 days.

TI  - Oviductal antibody response to a defined recombinant sperm antigen in macques.  
AB  - Macaque oviductal fluids were assayed for specific antibodies to the intra-acrosomal sperm protein SP-10 after immunizations with recombinant macaque SP-10 (re-mqSP-10), a candidate contraceptive vaccinogen. Access ports, consisting of a subcutaneous collecting reservoir and a catheter to cannulate the oviduct, were implanted into monkeys for repeated aspiration of oviductal fluid. Monkeys were inoculated i.m. once a month with an emulsion consisting of 2 mg re-mqSP-10 in a vehicle of squalene and mannin monooleate. Oviductal fluids and serum were collected during the periovulatory period for six menstrual cycles, and IgG and IgA antigen-specific antibodies in preimmune and immune fluids were compared by ELISA. Both relative and absolute concentrations of SP-10-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) were determined.  Oviductal fluids from immunized animals showed significant increases in anti-SP-10 IgG at cycle 2 and at all subsequent intervals. Anti-SP-10 IgA significantly increased in oviductal fluid at cycles 4, 5, and 6. Serum anti-SP-10 IgG increased at cycle 2 and remained significantly elevated through cycle 6, while serum anti-SP-10 IgA was higher than in preimmune samples at cycle 4. Serum antibodies generated to the recombinant SP-10 recognized SP-10 extracted from macaque sperm on Western blots. Immunocytochemical staining of macaque and human sperm showed acrosomal immunofluorescence with both immune oviductal fluids and serum using both anti-IgG and anti-IgA secondary antibodies. This study demonstrates for the first time 1) IgG and IgA antibodies to a defined recombinant sperm-specific antigen in primate oviductal fluids after systemic immunization and 2) the recognition by primate oviductal fluid IgG and IgA of the endogenous contraceptive target on both human and macaque sperm.

TI  - [Blood ultrafiltration in postoperative brain edema-swelling in neuro-oncology patients]  
AB  - A hundred and sixteen postoperative patients after removal of various brain tumors in whom brain edema developed were treated with 1-3 courses of blood ultrafiltration (BUF). 0.5-9.0 liters of ultrafiltrate was removed. BUF does not lead to blood concentration due to the movement of the fluid from intracellular to intravascular space. BUF allows to decrease the amount of toxic medium-sized peptides and osmolarity discriminant. Seldom the minor complications were observed because of usage of the plate shaped dialyzers. When the capillary dialyzers were used, no complications were noted. BUF may be recommended in patients with brain tumors in early postoperative period when traditional medical management does not seem to be effective enough. The technique helps to reduce the duration of brain edema in treated patients by 8-10 days vs. controls treated traditionally.

TI  - The distal colon provides reserve storage capacity during colonic fluid overload.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to its absorptive function the capacity of the colon to retain fluid might be relevant in compensating for increased fluid loads and prevention of diarrhoea. The distal colon is considered to be mainly a conduit without extensive storage function. AIMS: To evaluate colonic volume capacity in a model of pure osmotic diarrhoea. METHODS: A non-absorbable, iso-osmotic solution (OS) containing polyethylene glycol (500 ml) was infused into the caecum of nine healthy volunteers; the control group (n = 5) received an equal amount of an easily absorbable electrolyte solution (ES). Fluids were radiolabelled with technetium-99m and gamma camera images were obtained for 48 hours. Counts in the proximal and distal colon were measured and regional and overall colonic transit and stool output were quantified. RESULTS: After OS, in contrast to ES, faecal output was increased significantly (p < 0.05), but colonic transit after OS was not different from transit after ES (p > 0.05). This indicates storage of OS in the colon: after OS infusion, counts in the proximal colon decreased linearly while the distal colon stored approximately 30% of radioactivity for the whole 48 hour study period. After OS, stool output correlated with distal (p < 0.01), but not with proximal (p > 0.05), colonic transit. In contrast, after ES, stool output was determined by proximal colonic transit (p < 0.05) but not by transit through the distal colon (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The distal colon retains non-absorbable fluid volumes extensively. In our model transit through the distal colon--but not the proximal colon--determined the time at which diarrhoea occurred.

TI  - Necrosis and apoptosis of polymorphonuclear cells exposed to peritoneal dialysis fluids in vitro.  
AB  - Conventional peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids are known to inhibit polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) phagocytosis, oxidative burst and enzyme release. However, the relative contributions of apoptosis and/or necrosis to this dysfunction have not been examined. We investigated the effects of osmolality, glucose concentration and heat-sterilization of PD fluids on necrosis and apoptosis of PMN. Polymorphonuclear cells were isolated from 8 healthy volunteers and exposed to different PD fluids for four hours. PMN were then double-stained with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide to study the proportion of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to confirm the results obtained with flow cytometry. The fluids studied were conventionally heat-sterilized 1.5% Dianeal (1.5% D), conventionally heat-sterilized 4.25% Dianeal (4.25% D), 1.5% D in which the osmolality was increased to that of 4.25% D by adding mannitol (1.5% D + M), a filter-sterilized version of 4.25% D (4.25% D-F) and a 1.1% amino acid PD fluid (AA) (Nutrineal PD4). All PD fluids had their pH equilibrated (pH = 7.4) by the addition of sodium bicarbonate. Compared to PMN exposed to culture medium, a significantly higher proportion of necrosis was observed in PMN exposed to 1.5% D (P = 0.04). The 4.25% D induced greater necrosis than 1.5% D (P = 0.001), and the 4.25% D also induced significantly more necrosis (P = 0.002) compared to 4.25% D-F. These data suggest that the consequences of heat-sterilization, rather than high glucose concentration are responsible for the necrosis observed. Indeed, the proportion of necrotic PMN with 4.25% D-F was not significantly different from 1.5% D. The 1.5% D + M and AA induced significantly more apoptosis compared to 1.5% D (P = 0.006 and P < 0.05, respectively), suggesting that apoptosis can be induced by the high osmolality of PD fluids. However, 1.5% D +/- M also induced significantly more apoptosis (P = 0.007) compared to 4.25% D-F. This suggests that the apoptosis effect is specific for the osmolyte present in PD fluids, and that mannitol and amino acids induce more apoptosis than glucose. In summary, the different non-physiological components of conventional PD fluids evaluated in this study had a differential effect on PMN survival. Heat sterilization of high glucose-containing PD fluids was associated predominantly with necrosis of PMN, and high osmolality with apoptosis.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro developmental toxicity in LPS-induced zinc-deficient rabbits.  
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce maternal hypozincemia in order to test the hypothesis that altered zinc homeostasis is developmentally toxic in the rabbit. Treatment of dams on Gestation Day (GD) 8 with LPS (0.67 microgram/kg i.v.) caused total resorption of 78% (7 of 9) of the litters whereas GD 10 treatment increased the percentage of resorbed implantations (18-fold), but resulted in only 14% (1 of 7) totally resorbed litters. Cotreatment with zinc oxide (ZnO) on GD 10 decreased the resorption rate by 44%, indicating that hypozincemia was partially responsible for the resorptions. However, ZnO had no effect on resorption rate in GD 8 LPS-treated dams. No malformations were observed with LPS dosing on either gestation day. To determine whether LPS-induced Zn deficiency had any direct effects on rabbit embryos, normal GD 9 embryos were cultured for 48 h in serum from LPS-treated dams (0.53 +/- 0.01 microgram/mL Zn) or from controls (1.74 +/- 0.07 micrograms/mL Zn). Embryo growth and development were normal in both groups, indicating a lack of any direct embryo effects of Zn deficiency. Finally, maternal plasma progesterone and the Zn content of conceptus tissues were measured 24 h after LPS injection on GD 10. Despite a marked decrease in maternal serum Zn, no significant changes in embryo, visceral yolk sac, yolk sac cavity-exoceolomic fluid, or placental Zn were found. However, maternal progesterone levels were decreased 33 and 28% in the LPS and LPS + ZnO groups, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that rabbits may differ from rodent species in their lesser susceptibility to the teratogenic potential of transient maternal Zn deficiency, as well as in their resistance to conceptus Zn changes. Nonetheless, Zn deficiency may be responsible for an increase in resorption rate in the rabbit.

TI  - Transcapillary forces of the subcutaneous tissue in patients treated with interleukin-2 and alpha-interferon: no capillary protein leak syndrome?  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha-2a) causes protein leakage from plasma to the interstitium, leading to the so called 'capillary leak syndrome'. This syndrome is supposed to cause dose-limiting side effects such as weight gain, edema and pleural effusions. Seven patients with disseminated malignant melanoma or renal carcinoma were studied before and after 5 and 12 days of treatment. Transcapillary forces were studied by measuring colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid (on the thorax and ankle) with a 'wick' method. The colloid osmotic pressure in plasma was reduced by 30-35% during treatment, but with corresponding reductions in the interstitium. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum albumin and total protein decreased, whereas moderate edemas and weight gain were observed. These results demonstrate that during treatment with IL-2 and IFN-alpha-2a there are both fluid retention and augmented filtration of fluid from the vascular to the interstitial compartment, but no indication for a capillary leak syndrome. This may explain many of the cardiovascular side effects observed during such treatment.

TI  - Mathematical model of an adult human atrial cell: the role of K+ currents in repolarization.  
AB  - We have developed a mathematical model of the human atria myocyte based on averaged voltage-clamp data recorded from isolated single myocytes. Our model consists of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type equivalent circuit for the sarcolemma, coupled with a fluid compartment model, which accounts for changes in ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm as well as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This formulation can reconstruct action potential data that are representative of recordings from a majority of human atrial cells in our laboratory and therefore provides a biophysically based account of the underlying ionic currents. This work is based in part on a previous model of the rabbit atrial myocyte published by our group and was motivated by differences in some of the repolarizing currents between human and rabbit atrium. We have therefore given particular attention to the sustained outward K+ current (I[sus]), which putatively has a prominent role in determining the duration of the human atrial action potential. Our results demonstrate that the action potential shape during the peak and plateau phases is determined primarily by transient outward K+ current, I(sus) and L-type Ca2+ current (I[Ca,L]) and that the role of I(sus) in the human atrial action potential can be modulated by the baseline sizes of I(Ca,L), I(sus) and the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current. As a result, our simulations suggest that the functional role of I(sus) can depend on the physiological/disease state of the cell.

TI  - Ofloxacin penetration into the eye after intravenous and topical administration.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the aqueous and vitreous fluid penetration of ofloxacin after a combined topical and single intravenous dose protocol before vitrectomy surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Before undergoing vitrectomy surgery, patients were given two drops of ofloxacin 0.3% topically and a single intravenous dose of ofloxacin 400 mg. Aqueous (mean, 43 minutes) and vitreous (mean, 53 minutes) fluid samples were collected at the start of the surgical procedure. The samples were analyzed for ofloxacin penetration. RESULTS: The mean aqueous fluid concentration was 1.083 micrograms/mL +/- 0.406. The mean +/- SD vitreous fluid concentration in nondiabetic patients with intact vitreous was 0.352 microgram/mL +/- 0.301. Vitreous levels obtained more than 50 minutes after administration (0.414 microgram/mL +/- 0.336) were generally higher than those obtained after less than 50 minutes (P = 0.12). Eyes with prior vitrectomies achieved better ofloxacin penetration (0.984 microgram/mL +/- 0.680) than did nonvitrectomized eyes. CONCLUSION: Ofloxacin achieved measurable aqueous fluid penetration after topical and intravenous administration. Aqueous levels were above the minimum inhibitory concentration for most ocular pathogens. Vitreous levels were adequate in vitrectomized eyes to achieve inhibitory concentrations against many common ocular pathogens. Combined preoperative topical and a single dose of intravenous ofloxacin may provide inhibitory aqueous and vitreous antibiotic levels in vitrectomized eyes in cases where intravitreal antibiotics are not considered and oral administration is not practical.

TI  - Calcium-stimulated Cl- secretion in Calu-3 human airway cells requires CFTR.  
AB  - Human airway serous cells secrete antibiotic-rich fluid, but, in cystic fibrosis (CF), Cl(-)-dependent fluid secretion is impaired by defects in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels. Typically, CF disrupts adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated Cl- secretion but spares Ca(2+)-mediated secretion. However, in CF airway glands, Ca(2+)-mediated secretion is also greatly reduced. To determine the basis of Ca(2+)-mediated Cl- secretion in serous cells, we used thapsigargin to elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in Calu-3 cells, an airway cell line bearing some similarities to serous cells. Cells were cultured using conventional and air interface methods. Short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial conductance (Gte) were measured in confluent cell layers. Thapsigargin stimulated large, sustained changes (delta) in Isc and Gte, whereas forskolin stimulated variable and smaller increases. delta Isc was decreased by basolateral bumetanide, quinidine, barium, or diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPAC) but was unaffected by high apical concentrations of 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, and calixarene. Isc was measured after permeabilizing the basolateral membrane and establishing transmembrane ion gradients. Unstimulated apical membranes displayed high Cl- conductance (GCl) that was decreased by DPAC but not by DIDS. Apical GCl could be increased by elevating intracellular cAMP concentration but not [Ca2+]i. We conclude that CFTR channels are the exclusive GCl pathway in the apical membrane and display approximately 60% of maximum conductance at rest. Thus elevated [Ca2+]i increases K+ conductance to force Cl- through open CFTR channels. We hypothesize that loss of CFTR channels causes diminution of cholinergically mediated gland secretions in CF.

TI  - Hyaluronic acid-modified bioadhesive liposomes as local drug depots: effects of cellular and fluid dynamics on liposome retention at target sites.  
AB  - Bioadhesive liposomes, in which hyaluronic acid is the surface-anchored bioadhesive ligand, are being tested in vitro in order to evaluate their bioadhesivity. The first part of the test, binding to monolayers of cells modeling the in vivo designated sites under static conditions, was reported in a previous communication. This communication reports the results of the second and third parts of the test, which consist of evaluating the retention of bound liposomes in the face of tissue-related events such as cell migration, proliferation, and death, and under fluid flow. The in vivo-designated binding sites for the bioadhesive liposomes were modeled, as before, by monolayers of the A431 cell line served. A setup for perfusing a culture flask containing a monolayer of cells was devised for measuring the retention under fluid flow. The major findings are: (1) Over a selected tested period of 28 h, the cell cultures mimicked the tissue-related events described above, whether they did or did not receive a dose of liposomes. Over the same period and throughout these events, the bioadhesive liposomes remained bound at equilibrium-like levels, in the range of 0.03 ng lipid/10(5) cells. (2) Fluid flowed over a cell monolayer dosed with bioadhesive liposomes swept away part of the dose. This loss was due mostly to that fraction of the dose which was in excess of the binding capacity of the monolayer, and occurred over the first 15 min of flow. Thereafter, the cell monolayer retained the bound liposomes, at equilibrium-like levels and with no further loss, even for the longest flow period tested (45 min of continuous flow) and under a flow rate of 0.64 ml/min. This study, together with previous results, shows that the hyaluronic acid-modified liposomes meet all parts of the bioadhesivity test. We therefore find merit in their further investigation.

Glucose, pyruvate and lactate concentrations in tubal fluid, measured by microfluorescence assays, were 1.11, 0.14 and 5.4 mM respectively. The concentrations of 17 amino acids in tubal fluid were measured by high performance liquid chromatography following fluorescence derivatization. Arginine (0.19 mM) > alanine (0.11 mM) > glutamate (0.09 mM) were present in highest concentration in all phases of the cycle. All 17 amino acid concentrations in tubal fluid were below those in the vascular perfusate. These data provides the basis for a culture medium whose composition mimics the physiological environment to which early human embryos are exposed.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of human hydrosalpingeal fluid on mouse preimplantation embryonic development is significantly reduced by the addition of lactate.  
AB  - Implantation and pregnancy rates following in-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer are reduced in the presence of hydrosalpinges, but the basis of the inhibition is unknown. We examined the effect of hydrosalpingeal fluid on preimplantation development of mouse embryos. Embryos cultured in 100% hydrosalpingeal fluid were significantly inhibited developmentally as compared to embryos cultured in 100% defined medium, which served as controls. In contrast, embryos cultured in 50% hydrosalpingeal fluid/50% defined medium reached the blastocyst stage at the same frequency as the controls. When lactate (final concentration 10 mM) was added to 100% hydrosalpingeal fluid, the percentage of cultured embryos that reached the blastocyst stage was significantly increased as compared to 100% hydrosalpingeal fluid, although the percentage was slightly lower than that observed for embryos cultured in the 100% defined medium. A similar but less pronounced effect occurred when pyruvate was added to hydrosalpingeal fluid. These results do not support the concept that a potent embryotoxic agent is commonly present in hydrosalpingeal fluid. Rather, they are consistent with the notion that the inhibitory effect of hydrosalpingeal fluid on embryonic development is due to the absence of essential factors, and that this deficiency can be largely corrected by the addition of energy sources.

TI  - Central venous catheter access.  
AB  - Central venous access for the purpose of supplying parenteral nutrition to the pediatric age group requires a careful definition of the patient's caloric need, estimated duration of therapy, and an assessment of available sites. Peripheral vein parenteral nutrition is limited by caloric density of the nutrient fluids, while peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) offers a new technology for accessing central veins while obviating the risk of central vein access. Routes of central vein access are several and there are also a variety of catheters available for placement. Tunneled percutaneous placement of silicone rubber cuffed catheters via the subclavian vein approach is that technique we use most commonly. The risks of such access catheters include mechanical risks of placement, venous thrombosis of the access sites, and most importantly catheter related infections, either at the exit site, the subcutaneous tunnel or pouch, or even generalized sepsis. With a full knowledge of the spectrum of access techniques, access materials, and risks, safe total parenteral nutrition can be safely delivered to the children in need.

TI  - Significant correlation between matrix metalloproteinase activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in salivary extravasation mucoceles.  
AB  - We examined the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in luminal fluid of 18 extravasation mucoceles and in saliva from Wharton's duct of five patients by means of gelatin zymography and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. The luminal fluid showed a high level of MMP activity compared with the saliva. Quantitative determination by enzyme immunoassay revealed that the luminal fluid contained higher levels of TNF-alpha than the saliva. In addition, the amount of TNF-alpha in luminal fluid exhibited a direct correlation with MMP activity estimated by densitometric analysis of gelatin zymograms. Since TNF-alpha stimulates the production of MMPs from cells such as fibroblasts, these results suggest that TNF-alpha is one of the causal molecules that enhance the accumulation of proteolytic enzymes in luminal fluid of mucoceles.

TI  - Radioimmunoassay determination of formononetin in murine plasma and mammary glandular tissue.  
AB  - Formononetin is an isoflavonoid phytoestrogen found in animal fodder and in certain human foodstuffs. Since high consumption of formononetin has been implicated in infertility among ruminants and may relate to human breast cancer, we developed a radioimmunoassay method and applied it to quantitate formononetin in murine plasma and mammary glandular tissue for animal model studies. The radioimmunoassay utilized an antiserum raised in rabbits following immunization with formononetin-7-O(carboxymethyl)ether coupled to bovine serum albumin. The tracer was an [3H]leucine derivative of formononetin synthesized by mixed anhydride reaction between formononetin-7-O(carboxymethyl)ether and [3H]leucine. The bound and free forms of formononetin were separated by adding dextran-coated charcoal. This radioimmunoassay procedure enabled the quantification of 4 ng/ml of plasma or 50 pg/mg of mammary tissue, and the antiserum showed no marked cross-reaction with the reactants tested. The reliability and reproducibility of the assay were demonstrated by intra- and inter-assay variation that was 6.5% and 11.9%, respectively. This radioimmunoassay was compared with a high-performance liquid chromatographic method by determining concentrations of formononetin in ethanol extracts of red clover. Good correlation existed between the radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatographic method (r = 0.980), but the radioimmunoassay values were on the average 5% higher than high-performance liquid chromatographic values. Furthermore, we used the radioimmunoassay to assess the pharmacokinetics of formononetin in castrated female BALB/c mice after a single subcutaneous injection at 40 mg/kg dose. The sensitivity of the radioimmunoassay permitted the detection of a prolonged elimination phase for formononetin in both plasma and mammary glandular tissues, with mean elimination half-lives of 2 and 2.5 hr, respectively. A specific, sensitive, and fast radioimmunoassay procedure has been developed for the determination of formononetin in murine plasma and mammary glandular tissue. We conclude that the presented radioimmunoassay is a valid alternative method to the quantification of formononetin in biological fluids and/or plants.

TI  - Sonographic findings in aneurysmal bone cyst in children: correlation with computed tomography findings.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compares the value of sonography and computed tomography (CT) in assessing fluid-fluid levels (FFLs) in aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) in children. METHODS: Five children 4-13 years old with ABC in pubis, humerus, fibula, calcaneus, and ilium-ischium were studied between January 1995 and December 1996. Plain radiography, sonography, and CT were performed. RESULTS: FFLs were visualized equally or better with sonography than with CT. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that sonography be used to complement plain radiography in the prebiopsy assessment of expansile bone lesions with cortical bone thinning because the presence of FFLs is characteristic of ABC. CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging could be used in indeterminate cases and in complex anatomic locations. Such an approach would save time and reduce costs and discomfort to children.

TI  - The effect of the endothelial-cell glycocalyx on the motion of red blood cells through capillaries.  
AB  - The analysis of the rheology of the blood/capillary system presented here details the complex fluid-structure interactions that arise among blood cells, plasma, and the endothelial-cell glycocalyx. The capillary is modeled as a rigid cylindrical tube lined with a biphasic poroelastic wall layer which approximates the glycocalyx. The blood is approximated as a fluid suspension of tightly fitting deformable cells driven through the tube under a pressure gradient. Using mixture theory, the wall layer is modeled as interacting fluid and solid constituents in which the fluid is assumed to be linearly viscous and the solid is assumed to be linearly elastic. Axisymmetric lubrication theory is applied to the fluid in the gap between the red cell and the glycocalyx. The analysis details the fluid-phase velocity field throughout the wall and lubrication layers and provides the Reynolds equation for the pressure gradient along the length of the cell. The shell equations of equilibrium are employed to describe the mechanics governing the axisymmetric deformation of the red-cell membrane, where it is assumed that shear stress on the surface of the cell is balanced solely by isotropic membrane tension. Making use of the analytic expressions for the Reynolds equation and shear stress distribution on the cell surface, the pressure profile, membrane tension, and red-cell shape are obtained through numerical solution of a reduced system of coupled, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations. Rheological quantities including apparent viscosity and capillary tube hematocrit are presented and compared with in vitro and in vivo experimental data. The analysis predicts that the presence of a 1/2-microm-thick glycocalyx in a 5-microm capillary results in a threefold increase in resistance and a reduction in capillary tube hematocrit of more than 30% compared with the corresponding values in a 5-microm smooth-walled tube. Results are qualitatively consistent with in vivo observations of blood flow in microvascular networks. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - Day-to-day variability of fluid and solute transport in upright and recumbent positions during CAPD.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of posture on peritoneal transport characteristics during CAPD is unpredictable because (1) although the capillary pressure is higher in the upright position, the intraperitoneal pressure is also elevated, and (2) the contact of dialysate with the subdiaphragmatic lymphatics is probably more extensive during recumbency. METHODS: In eight CAPD patients, six peritoneal permeability tests (4 h, glucose 2.27%, dextran 70 as volume marker) were performed within 2 weeks, while the body posture was either recumbent (3 tests) or upright (3 tests). In addition, intraperitoneal pressure measurements were done in the recumbent and upright positions. RESULTS: The intraperitoneal pressure, not corrected for the contribution of the hydrostatic column, was higher in upright position (12.6 +/- 0.8 mmHg, mean +/- SEM) than during recumbency (6.7 +/- 0.8; P < 0.0005). Net ultrafiltration rate was lower when upright: 0.96 +/- 0.09 ml/min/1.73 m2, compared to 1.14 +/- 0.12 in the supine position (P < 0.05). This was achieved because the effective lymphatic absorption rate was marginally higher and the transcapillary ultrafiltration rate was slightly lower in the upright position. The mass transfer area coefficient of creatinine, representing effective peritoneal surface area, decreased from 10.7 +/- 1.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 (recumbent) to 9.9 +/- 1.4 (upright; P = 0.08). The clearances of five serum proteins decreased more the higher the molecular weight. As a consequence the restriction coefficient was 2.07 +/- 0.09 (recumbent) vs 2.23 +/- 0.08 (upright; P = 0.06). Hence the intrinsic permeability to macro-molecules was higher during recumbency. The intraperitoneal pressure was correlated with the net ultrafiltration rate (r = -0.71, P = 0.05) only during recumbency. In upright position relations were found between the effective lymphatic absorption rate and the mass transfer area coefficients of low molecular solutes. The coefficients of variation of fluid and solute parameters were not different between both positions. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the decrease in net ultrafiltration rate in the upright position is only small and probably caused by counteracting effects of a higher intra-abdominal pressure and the effect of gravity. The upright position also led to only small decreases in solute transport parameters.

TI  - Peritoneocele. A radiological study with defaeco-peritoneography.  
AB  - REPORT STUDY: Defaecography reports from 2816 patients were evaluated. Twenty-three percent of the investigations were considered normal, 31% showed rectal intussusception, 13% rectal prolapse, 27% rectocele, and 19% enterocele. A standardised protocol is suggested to ensure a complete evaluation of defaecography. One hundred and ten reports were unclear and reviewed. The unclear reports usually concerned an unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space, and gave incitement to further studies. TECHNIQUE STUDY: Twelve patients with an unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space at defaecography were investigated using defaecography and peritoneography simultaneously, by us named defaeco-peritoneography. All investigations were carried out without complications. Defaeco-peritoneography proved the unexplained widening to be an extension of the pouch of Douglas, a peritoneocele. UNEXPLAINED WIDENING STUDY: Twenty-two patients with unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space noted at defaecography were studied using defaeco-peritoneography. The outline and movements of the peritoneum in the pelvic cavity could be visualised during the dynamic act of defaecation. The unexplained widening of the rectovaginal space was caused completely by a peritoneocele in 14 patients, partially in 6 patients and 2 remained unexplained. However, only 9 out of 22 widenings were peritoneoceles with an enterocele. Just 11 peritoneoceles only contained fluid. Three types of peritoneocele were demonstrated: vaginal, septal, and rectal, with or without enterocele. Combinations of these were also found. RECTAL INTUSSUSCEPTION STUDY: Fifty-seven patients with defaecation disorders were examined using defaeco-peritoneography. Twenty-three patients had rectal intussusception and 7 patients had a rectal prolapse. All these patients had a rectal peritoneocele in the serosal ring-pocket of the rectal intussusception or in the rectal prolapse. Twenty-seven patients had neither rectal intussusception nor rectal prolapse and none of these patients had a rectal peritoneocele. DAILY LIFE STUDY: Twenty-six female patients showing peritoneocele without a contrast-filled rectum at start at defaeco-peritoneography were investigated; 13 of them had enteroceles. Spot radiographs before and after filling the rectum with contrast medium were compared. The peritoneocele disappeared completely in 19 of the patients and was reduced in size in the remaining 7, and the enterocele disappeared completely when the rectum was distended. Defaeco-peritoneography should therefore include a radiograph before the rectum is filled, as it shows the habitual (daily life) anatomy and can disclose pathology as peritoneocele and enterocele. TRANSFORMATION STUDY: Forty-six patients with peritoneocele at defaeco-peritoneography were studied at three different stages during rectal evacuation. At start with contrast-filled rectum, 14 patients had a peritoneocele, and 32 were regarded as normal. At maximum straining, all patients had a peritoneocele and 20 of these were still present after rectal evacuation. The peritoneoceles were largest at straining and rectal types were most common. No enterocele was seen at start. At maximum straining, 21 patients developed an enterocele.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) substrate zymography. A new tool to identify and characterize IGFBP-degrading proteinases.  
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) degrading proteinase activities have been described in biological fluids and conditioned media from numerous cell lines. To identify and characterize IGFBP-degrading proteinases, our laboratory has developed IGFBP substrate zymography. Herein, we illustrate how IGFBP substrate zymography can be used both to identify candidate IGFBP-degrading proteinases and characterize their degradative capabilities. For this purpose, human matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), a proteinase that degrades IGFBP-3 in human fibroblast cultures, was first electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide gel containing IGFBP-3 as substrate and then analyzed for its ability to degrade the substrate into immunoreactive fragments that were absorbed onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. IGFBP-3 substrate zymography was capable of detecting as little as 20 ng of human MMP-3, demonstrating a sensitivity similar to casein substrate zymography. Using the zymogram as a template, MMP-3 was identified in a standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel run in parallel with the zymogram, and the corresponding area of the gel was excised. Electroelution of the gel slice yielded active MMP-3 when examined by casein substrate zymography. Furthermore, digestion of IGFBP-3 in solution by the electroeluted MMP-3 revealed the same fragmentation pattern of the binding protein as that produced by MMP-3, which had not been electroeluted. Together, these studies demonstrate that IGFBP substrate zymography can be a useful tool for both the identification and the characterization of IGFBP-degrading proteinases.

TI  - Effects of pirfenidone and dermoid cyst fluid on adhesion formation.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of pirfenidone and human dermoid cyst fluid on adhesion formation in a rat model. DESIGN: A prospective, blinded, controlled study. SETTING: Sprague-Dawley white rats in a conventional laboratory setting. INTERVENTION(S): Rats were divided into four groups according to the type of solution tested (dermoid fluid, 0.05 mg of pirfenidone, normal saline, and a combination of dermoid fluid and pirfenidone). In the first experiment, the solution (0.5 mL) was injected intraperitoneally. In the second experiment, the solution was instilled intraperitoneally after a standardized injury to the right uterine horn. The degree of adhesion formation was evaluated 2 weeks after the initial surgery. RESULT(S): Human dermoid cyst fluid caused adhesion in 4 of 10 intact rats and in 9 of 10 standardized injured rats. Pirfenidone did not decrease adhesion formation. No adhesion was found after injection of saline or pirfenidone in intact rats. The mean +/- SEM adhesion score in standardized injured rats was higher in the dermoid group (4.6 +/- 0.6) than in the pirfenidone group (2.8 +/- 0.7) or the saline group (3.8 +/- 0.5). The mean +/- SEM adhesion score in intact rats was 0.6 +/- 0.3 after dermoid fluid injection and after dermoid instillation in standardized injured rats was 4.6 +/- 0.6. CONCLUSION(S): Human dermoid fluid causes adhesion formation even in intact rats, and the adhesion is worse in the presence of serosal injury. Intraperitoneal pirfenidone does not decrease adhesion formation.

TI  - Glycol ethers induce death and necrosis in human leukemia cells.  
AB  - Ethylene glycol ethers are common solvents. Some isomers are toxic for the reproduction and immunity functions of humans and laboratory animals and are antileukemic for rodents. The health hazards of ethylene glycol ethers may result from their ability to induce cell death in various organs or tissues. To study this possibility, the human leukemia cell lines HL-60, Molt3, and K562 were treated with ethylene glycol ethers. 2-Ethoxyethanol and 2-butoxyethanol were selected because they are among the most commonly used ethelyne glycol ethers, but little is known about their individual toxicity. Cell death was detected by trypan blue uptake, flow cytometry, DNA electrophoresis, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis. The treatments lasted up to 72 h with doses ranging from 1 to 20 mM, which are high relative to the concentrations found in biological fluids of exposed workers. The highest dose of 2-butoxyethanol (20 mM) induced apoptosis in Molt3 cells after 72 h incubation. Other treatments had no effect, induced necrosis, or blocked the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

TI  - Abdominal fluid collection secondary to acute pancreatitis: treated with percutaneous catheter drainage.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complicated pancreatic inflammatory diseases are often life-threatening, multifocal, and multibacterial disorders. Untreated, these lesions often prove fatal. The purpose of the study is to describe interventional radiologic techniques for diagnosis and treatment of complicated peripancreatic fluid collections. METHODS: Between January 1994 and December 1995, 17 patients with abdominal fluid collection from complicated acute pancreatitis underwent percutaneous drainage following initial diagnosis with computed tomography (CT). These patients required multiple CT examinations, multiple catheter insertions, multiple catheter manipulations, and long-term catheter drainage. RESULTS: Twenty-five infected fluid collections among these 17 patients were percutaneously drained. Sixteen (94%) patients were successfully treated with catheter drainage alone. Surgical treatment was necessary in one patient because of segmental stricture of transverse colon caused by inflammation and adhesion of transverse mesocolon. Catheter drainage duration averaged 31 days. Patients required an average of three catheter manipulations and four abdominal CT scans. Mean hospital stay was 42 days (range, 11-95 days), and mean ICU stay was 25 days (range, 1-70 days). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that complicated peripancreatic fluid collections can be safely and effectively treated in most patients with percutaneous catheter technique.

TI  - Dissolution testing as a prognostic tool for oral drug absorption: immediate release dosage forms.  
AB  - Dissolution tests are used for many purposes in the pharmaceutical industry: in the development of new products, for quality control and, to assist with the determination of bioequivalence. Recent regulatory developments such as the Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme have highlighted the importance of dissolution in the regulation of post-approval changes and introduced the possibility of substituting dissolution tests for clinical studies in some cases. Therefore, there is a need to develop dissolution tests that better predict the in vivo performance of drug products. This could be achieved if the conditions in the gastrointestinal tract were successfully reconstructed in vitro. The aims of this article are, first, to clarify under which circumstances dissolution testing can be prognostic for in vivo performance, and second, to present physiological data relevant to the design of dissolution tests, particularly with respect to the composition, volume, flow rates and mixing patterns of the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, brief comments are made in regard to the composition of in vitro dissolution media as well as the hydrodynamics and duration of the test.

TI  - Cytokines in nasal fluids from school children with seasonal allergic rhinitis.  
AB  - Allergic rhinitis is a particularly good model for studies of cytokine production in vivo. In this study the occurrence of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-gamma as well as the soluble receptor for IL-4 in nasal lavage fluids were assayed in 38 school children, with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and 19 healthy age-matched, non-atopic controls, using highly sensitive enzyme immunoassays. IL-4 levels in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were markedly increased in comparison with those in non-atopic controls or in atopic patients before the start of the pollen season. In controls, but not in the atopic patients, levels of IFN-gamma and IL-5 were significantly higher in specimens obtained during the pollen season than in those obtained outside the season. The IL-4/IFN-gamma ratios were significantly higher in atopic than in non-atopic subjects and further increased in atopic patients during the season. In addition to IL-4, elevated levels of IL-10 were observed in association with seasonal rhinitis. Following treatment with a topical steroid (budesonide) there was a statistically significant increase of the levels of soluble IL-4 receptor. These findings indicate that nonatopic and atopic individuals react to pollen exposure with distinct cytokine patterns in agreement with the Th1/Th2 concept. Topical steroids may possibly decrease inflammation by increasing the formation of soluble IL-4 receptor.

TI  - Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble TNF receptors in chronic venous leg ulcers--correlations to healing status.  
AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in chronic venous leg ulcers are associated with impaired healing. TNF-alpha was measured by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and a bioassay (KYM-1D4) in paired wound fluid samples collected during the nonhealing and healing phases from 21 human patients with venous leg ulcers. Soluble TNF receptor levels (p55 and p75) were also measured. The levels of immunoreactive TNF-alpha were significantly higher in wound fluid from nonhealing ulcers than in wound fluid from healing ulcers (p < 0.005), whereas the levels of bioactive TNF-alpha were not. Statistical analysis confirmed that TNF-alpha bioactivity relative to the amount of immunoreactive TNF-alpha was downregulated in wound fluid from nonhealing ulcers compared with healing ulcers. The levels of soluble p55 and p75 receptors in wound fluid showed a significant linear correlation (p < 0.001), suggesting a partially coordinated or common regulatory mechanism for the cleavage of transmembrane TNF receptors in chronic venous ulcers in vivo. Although the levels of soluble p75 receptors were significantly higher in nonhealing wound fluid compared with healing wound fluid (p < 0.025), these levels were theoretically inadequate to substantially neutralize the bioactivity of the accompanying TNF-alpha levels on their own. The bioactivity accompanying the elevated levels of immunoreactive TNF-alpha in wound fluid from nonhealing ulcers may have been further down-modulated by an additional mechanism. Because healing was initiated without a significant decline in the level of bioactive TNF-alpha, TNF-alpha-mediated events may not be the key events contributing to the impaired healing seen in chronic venous ulcers.

TI  - Short periods of oscillating fluid pressure directed at a titanium-bone interface in rabbits lead to bone lysis.  
AB  - Fluctuating high fluid pressures have been reported in pseudojoints after total hip arthroplasty, and may be present throughout the effective joint space. When the pressure extends locally to the bone implant interface, we hypothesized that it might have led to bone resorption. We developed an experimental implant model to study whether oscillating fluid pressure, applied during 2 hours a day, can lead to osteolysis at the bone implant interface. 12 mature rabbits received a titanium implant, which was allowed to osseointegrate. Thereafter, fluid pressure was applied to a specific area of the titanium bone interface at the periosteal side of the cortex in 6 of the rabbits. The pressure, applied during 2 hours a day for 14 days, oscillated between 70 and 150 mm Hg, with a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Bone resorption was not found in any of the control animals, but it occurred under 4 implants exposed to fluid pressure (p = 0.03; Fisher's exact test). Localized osteolytic lesions had developed, with evidence of osteocyte death in the surrounding cortical bone. In 1 of the 2 specimens without osteolysis, there was evidence of fluid leakage into the soft tissues. In 4 specimens (3 with and 1 without osteolysis), bone formation was observed at the endosteal side opposite to the pressure zone. This did not occur in the controls. No signs of infection were observed. Our findings indicate that oscillating fluid pressure, even when present only during short periods, can lead to osteolysis and may be a cause of prosthetic loosening. Endosteal bone apposition may be a result of the interstitial flow that was created, giving false signals of mechanical load to the osteocytes.

TI  - Efficacy of the Sonicare toothbrush fluid dynamic action on removal of human supragingival plaque.  
AB  - The fluid pressure and shear forces generated by the high frequency bristle motion of the Sonicare sonic toothbrush remove adherent colonies of cultured bacteria from model dental surfaces in vitro. These dynamic fluid effects can remove bacteria in vitro even at distances up to 4 mm beyond the tips of the bristles. To evaluate the efficacy of the Sonicare in removing actual human plaque deposits formed in vivo, an intraoral model was developed. Enamel sections were obtained from extracted human teeth and mounted on acrylic resin palatal prostheses, worn by two volunteers. Six enamel sections were arranged as three pairs at different locations on the prosthesis, and plaque was allowed to form overnight (approximately 16 h). The sections were removed, placed in phosphate-buffered saline, and exposed in vitro to the sonic toothbrush for 5, 10 or 15 seconds. The bristle tips were maintained at distances of 2 or 3 mm from the enamel surface. As a comparison, sections were also exposed to another electric toothbrush (Interplak) for 10 seconds using a distance of 3 mm between the bristles and the enamel. Following exposure to the toothbrushes, residual bacteria were removed from the sections by ultrasonication for 15 seconds, and total viable cell counts determined by serial dilution on blood agar plates. One section from each pair was used to measure total (baseline) microbial accumulation. At a distance of 3 mm between bristles and enamel, the sections exposed to Sonicare demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) plaque removal of 56-78% relative to non-treated controls. In contrast, the control electric brush did not demonstrate removal of plaque bacteria after 10 seconds exposure. These quantitative results were visually confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The findings demonstrate that the fluid dynamic activity generated by the sonic vibrations of the Sonicare toothbrush removed microbial plaque formed in vivo, even at a distance of 3 mm beyond its bristle tips.

TI  - Effect of pressure on the catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg suspended in compressed gases.  
AB  - We studied the effect of pressure up to 300 bar on the catalytic efficiency of subtilisin Carlsberg suspended in compressed propane, near-critical ethane, near-critical carbon dioxide and tert-amyl alcohol, at constant temperature and fixed enzyme hydration. Increasing pressure lowered the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme in all the solvents, resulting in positive activation volumes, delta V#. The delta V# values in compressed propane and in tert-amyl alcohol were similar and larger in magnitude than the value reported in the literature for the same reaction in an aqueous buffer, although within the range of typical delta V# values in aqueous media. In the near-critical fluids, the delta V# were much larger, e.g., an increase in pressure of only 200 bar causing a sixfold decrease in the catalytic efficiency of subtilisin in carbon dioxide. These data should reflect the proximity of ethane and carbon dioxide to the critical point, and the resulting condensation of solvent molecules about the solutes, yielding negative solute partial molar volumes.

TI  - Effectiveness of fibrin glue for preventing postoperative extradural fluid leakage.  
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage through dural sutures after craniotomy increases the risk of complications such as persistent CSF fistulas, meningitis, and subcutaneous, graft bone, or epidural infections. The effectiveness of fibrin glue for preventing CSF leakage through dural closure was investigated in 183 patients who underwent frontotemporal craniotomy for unruptured aneurysm. Fibrin glue was used in 138 patients, but not in the other 45. Computed tomography was used to evaluate postoperative extradural fluid collection as a minimal volume of low-density area. Postoperative computed tomography demonstrated transient increases in extradural fluid collection in 55 patients. However, none of these patients received a second surgery for dural repair. Fluid collection occurred in 19 of 45 patients (42%) in whom fibrin glue was not used, and in 36 of 138 patients (26%) in whom fibrin glue was used. The fibrin sealant on the dural suture was a significant factor in reducing the incidence of the fluid leakage (p < 0.05, chi-square test). Fibrin glue is a useful surgical tool for the prevention of postoperative extradural fluid collection through the dural sutures.

AB  - AIMS: To explore the changes in neutrophil adhesion molecule expression and release into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) obtained from infants who developed chronic lung disease (CLD). METHODS: BAL fluid was obtained from 37 infants: 18 (median gestation 26 weeks, birthweight 835 g) who developed CLD, 12 (29 weeks, 1345 g) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and seven control infants (33 weeks, 2190 g). RESULTS: Soluble L-selectin (sL-selectin) in BAL fluid from the CLD and non-CLD groups was similar immediately after birth, but in infants who subsequently developed CLD, sL-selectin remained persistently increased (at day 7: CLD 42.6 vs RDS 6.0 ng/ml, p < 0.05; CLD vs controls 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.05). CD11b/CD18 expression on neutrophils obtained by BAL increased with time to reach a maximum at 17 days of age in infants who developed CLD. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that leucocyte traffic persists in infants who develop CLD and may have an important part to play in the pathogenesis of CLD.

TI  - Human beta-defensin-1: an antimicrobial peptide of urogenital tissues.  
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are widely distributed mediators of innate host defense in animals and plants. A 36 amino acid antimicrobial peptide belonging to the defensin family, and named human beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1), was purified recently from hemodialysate fluid, but its tissue sources were not identified. By Northern blotting, we found the highest concentrations of HBD-1 mRNA in the kidney and the female reproductive tract. In situ hybridization localized the HBD-1 mRNA in the epithelial layers of the loops of Henle, distal tubules, and the collecting ducts of the kidney and the epithelial layers of the vagina, ectocervix, endocervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in the female reproductive tract. Using a novel technique designed to detect cationic peptides in urine, we recovered several forms of HBD-1 ranging in length from 36 to 47 amino acid (aa) residues and differing from each other by amino terminal truncation. The total concentration of HBD-1 forms in voided urine was estimated at 10-100 microg/liter, with individual variations in the total amount of HBD-1 peptides and the relative proportion of HBD-1 forms. Multiple forms of HBD-1 (size 36-47 aa) were also found in the blood plasma, bound to carrier macromolecules that released the peptide under acid conditions, and in vaginal mucosal secretions (39, 40, and 44 aa). By immunostaining, HBD-1 was located in the kidney within the lumen of the loops of Henle, but no intracellular storage sites were identified in renal or female reproductive tissues. Recombinant HBD-1 forms (36, 39, and 42 aa) and natural HBD-1 forms were antimicrobial to laboratory and clinical strains of Escherichia coli at micromolar concentrations. HBD-1 activity was not changed appreciably by low pH, but was inhibited by high salt conditions. Some of the HBD-1 peptides retained their activity against E. coli in unconcentrated (low conductance) urine, and the 36 aa form was microbicidal even in normal (high conductance) urine. Production of HBD-1 in the urogenital tract could contribute to local antimicrobial defense.

TI  - Concentration of enrofloxacin and its active metabolite in alveolar macrophages and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid of dogs.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the concentration of enrofloxacin and its active metabolite, ciprofloxacin, in alveolar macrophages (AM) and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lungs in comparison to plasma concentrations in healthy dogs. Eleven dogs were given a single oral dose (5 mg/kg) of enrofloxacin. Four hours later, plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected. Cells were separated from the BAL fluid and lysed for determination of drug concentrations within AM. Supernatant was used to determine concentrations of drugs in ELF. Drug assays were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of enrofloxacin (mean +/- SD) was 0.33 +/- 0.14 microgram/mL in plasma, 3.34 +/- 2.4 micrograms/mL in AM and 4.79 +/- 5.0 micrograms/mL in ELF. The concentration of ciprofloxacin was 0.42 +/- 0.26 microgram/mL in plasma, 1.15 +/- 1.03 micrograms/mL in AM and 0.26 +/- 0.26 microgram/mL in ELF. Mean concentrations of both drugs in AM were greater than in plasma (AM to plasma ratio, 10.3 for enrofloxacin and 4.7 for ciprofloxacin). Mean concentrations of enrofloxacin, but not ciprofloxacin, in ELF were greater than in plasma (ELF to plasma ratio, 13.5 for enrofloxacin and 0.52 for ciprofloxacin). Enrofloxacin concentrations in AM and ELF largely exceeded the MICs of the major bacterial pathogens and surpassed by about two times the breakpoint MIC of that drug, and ciprofloxacin concentrations in AM surpassed the MIC of many susceptible organisms. These results suggest that sufficient antimicrobial activity is present in AM and ELF of dogs following oral administration of enrofloxacin to be effective in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections involving susceptible organisms.

TI  - Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. A report of two cases with diagnostic features in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare condition that has been associated with myriad diseases and disorders. Alveolar spaces are progressively filled with a phospholipoproteinaceous material, presumably related to a derangement of surfactant production and/or catabolism. The cytologic features of PAP in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sediments are unique, and recognition of these characteristics can help guide clinical intervention. CASES: A 47-year-old male with a history of progressive dyspnea and recent pneumonia presented with a five-lobe alveolar infiltrate and subsequently underwent bronchoscopic examination. A 31-year-old female with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast transformation developed unresponsive pulmonary infiltrates necessitating bronchoscopy with lavage.  Both BAL lavage fluid sediments contained a homogeneous, basophilic, granular material typical of PAP. The material was composed of extracellular, multilamellated bodies when viewed by electron microscopy. Both patients required repeated therapeutic whole lung lavage, and one died of the disease eight months after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation, grossly milky BAL fluid and fluid sediment with light microscopic findings of basophilic, periodic acid-Schiff-positive, granular debris with cholesterol crystals and a few alveolar macrophages suggest this process. The light microscopic findings can be confirmed by ultramicroscopic demonstration of extracellular multilamellated bodies. BAL with appropriate examination of the effluent sediment facilitates the diagnosis of PAP.

TI  - Particle motion within in vitro models of stenosed internal carotid and left anterior descending coronary arteries.  
AB  - Asymmetric 75% and 95% area reduction, transparent Sylgard stenotic models were operated under internal carotid artery (ICA) [Womersley parameter, alpha=5.36, Re(mean) =213 and 180, respectively, and Re(peak)=734 and 410, respectively] and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) flow wave forms (alpha=2.65, Re(mean)=59 and 57, respectively, and Re(peak)= 137 and 94, respectively) to evaluate the effect of these conditions on particle residence times downstream of the stenoses. Amberlite particles (1.05 g/cm3, 400 microm) were added to the fluid to simulate platelets and their motion through the stenotic region and were traced using a laser light sheet flow visualization method with pseudo-color display. Two-dimensional (2D) particle motions were recorded and particle washout in the stenotic throat and downstream section were computed for all cases. All four model cases demonstrated jetting through the stenosis which followed an arching pattern around a large separation zone downstream. Considerable mixing was observed within these vortex regions during high flow phases. Particle washout profiles showed no clear trend between the degrees of stenosis although particles downstream of the stenoses tended to remain longer for LAD conditions. The critical washout cycle (1% of particles remaining downstream of the stenosis), however, was longer for the 95% stenoses cases under each flow condition due to the larger protected region immediately downstream and maximal for the LAD 95% case. Results of this study suggest that particle residence times downstream of 75% and 95% stenoses (approximately 3-6 s for ICA and approximately 8-10 s for LAD) exceed the minimum time for platelet adhesion (approximately 1 s) for at least 1% of cells and, thus, may be sufficient to initiate thrombus formation under resting conditions.

The results were compared with those obtained by examination by electron microscopy and virus isolation by cell culture. The PCR did not differentiate between HSV 1 and 2. By PCR, 64 HSV infections and 53 VZV infections were identified, with presumed 100% sensitivity and specificity. Fifteen specimens tested negative by PCR, electron microscopy, and virus isolation for herpes viruses. The sensitivities of virus isolation and electron microscopy for detection of herpes simplex virus were 56% and 80%. For varicella zoster virus, the sensitivities of virus isolation and electron microscopy were 47% and 60%.

AB  - Paired serum and oral-fluid (OF) specimens (n = 4,448) were collected from blood donors and patients attending local sexually transmitted disease clinics in Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas and were tested for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies. Sera were tested by Abbott AB HIV-1/HIV-2 (rDNA) enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and positive specimens were confirmed by Cambridge HIV-1 and HIV-2 Western blotting (WB). OF specimens were collected with the OraSure collection device and were tested by Murex GACELISA and by two EIAs from Organon Teknika (the Oral Fluid Vironostika HIV-1 Microelisa System [OTC-L] and the Vironostika HIV-1 Microelisa System [OTC-M]). EIA-reactive OF specimens were confirmed by miniaturized WB (OFWB). GACELISA detected all 474 HIV-1 seropositive specimens (sensitivity, 100%). OTC-L detected 470 positive specimens (sensitivity, 99.2%), while OTC-M detected 468 positive specimens (sensitivity, 98.8%). Specificities ranged from 99.2 to 100% for the three assays. Concordance of OFWB with serum WB was 99.4%, and banding patterns determined by the two methods were similar. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration of OF specimens ranged from 0.21 to 100 microg/ml, with a mean of 17.1 microg/ml. Significant differences in OF IgG concentrations were observed between HIV antibody-positive and HIV antibody-negative persons (31.94 versus 15.28 microg/ml, respectively [P < 0.0001]). These data further confirm the suitability of OF specimens for detection of HIV-1 antibodies. Currently available HIV-1 antibody assays provide sensitivities and specificities with OF specimens comparable to those achieved with serum specimens.

TI  - Lipocortin I gene expression is higher in blood monocytes than in BAL fluid macrophages in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF WORK: Lipocortin I, induced by corticosteroids in vivo is considered to be related to cell activation and differentiation in mononuclear phagocytes, key cells in the process of epithelioid cell granuloma formation in sarcoidosis. Therefore, we focused on the expression of lipocortin I gene in mononuclear phagocytes in patients with sarcoidosis. METHOD: The amounts of transcripts of lipocortin I gene obtained from both BAL fluid macrophages and blood monocytes were measured by RT-PCR and HPLC, and then standardized as the ratio of lipocortin I/beta-actin for comparison. RESULTS: 1. Smoking did not affect the expression of lipocortin I gene in BAL fluid macrophages and monocytes. 2. There were no differences in the amounts of expression in BAL fluid macrophages between patient groups (nonsmokers and smokers), or between patients and healthy subjects. 3. The gene expression in BAL fluid macrophages was higher than that in monocytes in patients with IPF (macrophages 1.23 +/- 0.48, vs monocytes 0.50 +/- 0.38, p < 0.05) and healthy subjects (nonsmokers: 1.66 +/- 1.17, vs 0.34 +/- 0.26, p < 0.05, smoker: 1.98 +/- 0.96, vs 0.34 +/- 0.48, p < 0.05, but sarcoidosis patients showed a higher expression of lipocortin I gene even in monocytes (2.62 +/- 1.87, vs 2.66 +/- 2.21). CONCLUSION: The increase in lipocortin I gene expression in monocytes was a disease-related finding in sarcoidosis.

AB  - The disposition of fluid given by i.v. infusion can be studied by fitting one-volume and two-volume kinetic models to the fractioned dilution of blood haemoglobin and serum albumin concentrations over time. However, the two-volume model is sometimes associated with a high standard error in estimating the size of the secondary (peripheral) body fluid space, V2. To examine if a fixed elimination rate constant (kr) determined by urinary excretion can be used to make the model more stable, we infused Ringer's acetate 25 ml kg-1 over 30 min in 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 yr). A fixed kr increased the total residual error when curve-fitting was applied according to the one-volume model. The two-volume model was improved when there was a strong within-patient covariance between kr and V2 (r2 < or = -0.98). The size of V2 was 10 litre when the fixed and model-generated values of kr agreed fully.

TI  - Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor increases wound-fluid interleukin 8 in normal subjects but does not accelerate wound healing.  
AB  - Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is thought to play an important part under conditions of impaired wound healing. This is not confirmed and it is also unknown whether GM-CSF affects wound healing in healthy subjects. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in 10 healthy volunteers. Triplicate wounds (10 x 10 x 0.5 mm) on the right and left upper thigh were made by a razor blade and injected with GM-CSF or a solvent control. Four of the 10 volunteers were re-examined after 2 months by investigating the healing of a new set of triplicate wounds injected with solvent control alone (controls). Factors measured were wound healing time, wound-fluid cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, wound-fluid inflammatory cells and dermal thickness by ultrasonography. Intradermal injection with 20 micrograms GM-CSF per wound caused significantly higher wound-fluid GM-CSF and interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels than in controls, but did not affect the time needed for wound closure (mean 11 days in all groups), dermal thickness, wound-fluid inflammatory cells or other wound-fluid cytokines, e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 and beta 2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and beta-fibroblast growth factor (beta-FGF) were not measurable in any wound fluid. The lack of efficacy of exogenously delivered GM-CSF on wound healing in healthy subjects is probably based on the failure of GM-CSF to induce 'wound-healing cytokines' like PDGF, FGF, TGF, EGF or VEGF. However, GM-CSF increases IL-8 release, which is a potent chemotactic cytokine, indicating that GM-CSF might be of therapeutic value under conditions of impaired chemotaxis.

TI  - Carcinoembryonic antigen in breast nipple aspirate fluid.  
AB  - New diagnostic tools are needed to complement mammography and physical examinations for early detection of breast cancer, particularly among younger women. We evaluated the tumor biomarker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in 215 nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) samples collected from one or both breasts of 147 women, ages 27-87 years. Most subjects were recruited at the time of mammography examination. The 215 nipple fluid CEAs range from undetectable levels to 8400 ng/ml (median, 1100 ng/ml). Normal serum CEA levels are less than 6 ng/ml. There are no significant differences between the CEAs in fluid from normal breasts (112 samples) and breasts with various histories of tumors (total, 103 samples). Analyses for determinants of CEAs in fluids from normal breasts show higher levels among current smokers (P = 0.03) and marginal elevations among nulliparous women (P = 0.07). CEAs in these samples are not correlated with age, menopausal status, current hormone use, prior breastfeeding, or family history of breast cancer. Follow-up studies of these women and comparisons of CEAs in fluids from normal and cancer-containing breasts will help clarify whether this biomarker is useful for risk assessment or early cancer detection.

TI  - Penetration of ceftazidime into middle ear fluid in children with otitis media with effusion.  
AB  - Twenty-five children with otitis media with effusion received ceftazidime 50 mg/kg intravenously before bilateral myringotomy with insertion of tympanostomy tubes. Concentrations of ceftazidime measured in serum and middle ear fluid exceeded 4 mg/L (i.e., largely above the minimal inhibitory concentrations for the gram-negative pathogens commonly recovered from children with otitis media) for at least 4 hours. Mean peak concentrations occurred 30 to 90 minutes after the injection and reached 11 to 14 mg/L. These results are in keeping with the clinical efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of chronic middle ear infections in children.

TI  - Concentrations of sulfadoxine and trimethoprim in plasma, lymph fluids and some tissues 24 h after intramuscular administration to Angora goats.  
AB  - This study was carried out to determine the concentrations of sulfadoxine and trimethoprim in plasma, lymph, and some tissues in goats after administration of a single recommended therapeutic dose. Five healthy, adult Angora goats were used. The drug combination, containing 200 mg sulfadoxine and 40 mg trimethoprim per millilitre, was given as a single IM injection at the recommended dose level, 15 mg/kg body weight for sulfadoxine and 3 mg/kg body weight for trimethoprim. The goats were slaughtered 24 hours after drug administration and samples were taken from liver, bone marrow, pelvic limb muscles, hepatic, thoracic duct, and the pelvic limb lymph fluids for analysis of drug concentrations by HPLC. The concentrations of trimethoprim in bone marrow, liver, pelvic limb muscles, hepatic lymph, the pelvic limb lymph, and thoracic duct lymph were found to be 6, 5, 4, 2, 5 and 15 times higher than those of plasma, respectively. Although the sulfadoxine concentrations in bone marrow, pelvic limb muscles, and liver were 2, 3 and 2 times higher than the plasma concentrations, respectively, the sulfadoxine concentrations in hepatic lymph, the pelvic limb lymph, and thoracic duct lymph were lower than those of plasma. The results show that the trimethoprim concentrations in lymph fluids were quite similar to those in tissues. However, the sulfadoxine concentrations in lymph fluids were different in each tissue.

TI  - MR imaging of the small bowel using the HASTE sequence.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the normal MR appearance of small bowel on half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequence and to determine the ability of HASTE to reveal small-bowel disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HASTE images in 50 patients without small-bowel disease were reviewed retrospectively to determine the normal MR appearance of small bowel. All patients fasted for at least 6 hr. The images of 18 patients with proven small-bowel abnormalities that were obtained with the HASTE sequence were also reviewed retrospectively by one observer unaware of the findings. The ability to characterize small-bowel diseases using the HASTE sequence was assessed. RESULTS: In the 50 patients with normal small bowel, no fluid was seen in the jejunum and ileum loops in four (8%). Fluid was present in less than 25% of small-bowel loops in 20 patients (40%), 25-50% of small-bowel loops in 20 patients (40%), and 50-75% of small-bowel loops in six patients (12%). Equal amounts of fluid were present in the jejunum and ileum in 30 patients (60%). More fluid was seen in the jejunum than the ileum in 16 patients (32%) and the reverse was true in four patients (8%). The mean diameter of the jejunum was 2.1 cm (SD = 0.34 cm) and of the ileum, 1.9 cm (SD = 0.41 cm). The thickness of the small-bowel wall and valvulae conniventes averaged 2 mm. Findings of dilatation of the bowel lumen and increased thickness of the bowel wall and valvulae conniventes were identified in 18 patients with small-bowel abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The normal and abnormal small bowel can be assessed using the HASTE sequence.

TI  - Use of an antimicrobial removal device in endophthalmitis cultures.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study sought to determine whether the use of an antimicrobial removal device (ARD) to process intraocular fluids increases microbial detection compared with conventional cultures. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all cases of endophthalmitis submitted to their laboratory from January 1982 through December 1996. Aqueous or vitreous specimens or both that were cultured on conventional media (blood agar, chocolate agar, anaerobic blood agar, and thiol broth) and by ARD processing were included in the study. Specimens were inoculated into tubes with ARD for 5 to 10 minutes.  The fluid was then withdrawn and cultured using conventional media; thioglycolate broth was added to the tube containing the resin beads. The conventional and ARD-processed cultures were incubated at 35 degrees C for at least 7 days. RESULTS: Of the 338 endophthalmitis cultures processed using both conventional cultures and a parallel ARD, 166 (49.1%) yielded positive microbial growth on one or more media. Of the 166 culture-confirmed cases, 127 (76.5%) were positive in both the ARD-processed and direct cultures, 17 (10.2%) were positive by conventional culture only, and 22 (13.3%) were positive by the ARD-processed sample alone (P = 0.52). The spectrum of microorganisms was similar among all culture groups. The detection of coagulase-negative staphylococci and micrococci by ARD alone was slightly better than detection by conventional culture only (P = 0.06). Of 93 positive cultures from 179 patients in whom prior antibiotic use was documented, 75 (80.6%) were positive by both methods, 8 (8.6%) by conventional cultures only, and 10 (10.8%) only by the ARD-processed specimen (P = 0.81). CONCLUSION: Use of an antimicrobial removal device does not significantly increase the microbial yield of endophthalmitis cultures compared with conventional culture techniques, whether or not antimicrobial therapy is being used.

TI  -  Fluid shear stress activation of egr-1 transcription in cultured human endothelial and epithelial cells is mediated via the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.  
AB  - The primary response transcription factor, early growth response-1 (Egr-1), is rapidly activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Egr-1 binds to a sequence found in the promoters of genes involved in vascular injury, such as PDGF-A and tissue factor, and trans-activates their expression in endothelial cells in response to fluid shear stress. Here we show that egr-1 mRNA is increased after 30 min of flow in human aortic endothelial cell and HeLa cell cultures. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with reporter gene constructs driven by the murine or human egr-1 5' flanking sequence revealed a five- and ninefold induction, respectively, in transcriptional activity after exposure to a shear stress of 5 dynes/cm2 for 3 h. Deletion of sequences in the murine promoter containing two AP1 sites and an inhibitory Egr-1 binding sequence, did not reduce shear stress inducibility. However, progressive deletion of five serum response elements, reduced both the basal promoter activity and its capacity to be activated by shear stress. Further examination indicated that the three upstream serum response elements are predominantly responsible for shear stress activation of the egr-1 promoter. Treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 inhibited shear stress activation of egr-1. We suggest that egr-1 activation by shear stress involves activation of Elk-1 but not c-jun activity. These data, which are consistent with previous findings for shear mediated signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, now implicate shear modulation of the Egr-1 transcription factor in this pathway.

TI  - Dose uniformity of ophthalmic suspensions.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify the rate of redispersion of three commercially available ophthalmic preparations as well as the drug content of single drops during the course of emptying a full container of suspension eyedrops. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Koln, and Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Bonn, Germany. METHODS: In a computer-controlled test apparatus used to simulate the shaking and dropping behavior of humans under strictly reproducible conditions, we studied the rate of redispersion of three ophthalmic suspensions: 50 mg indomethacin, 50 mg prednisolone-21-acetate, and 50 mg dexamethasone in 5 mL of aqueous fluid. The degree of shaking intensity essential for the redispersion of the ophthalmic suspensions was quantified in healthy persons and patients by an acceleration sensor. RESULTS: The mean dose delivered and the coefficient of variation of prednisolone were satisfactory. However, only 25% of the dexamethasone was available for administration; the rest remained in the bottle as a cake of sediment. Also, the variability of the drug content between drops was unacceptably high. The mean dose of indomethacin was adequate, but the between-drop variability was excessive. CONCLUSION: The dose uniformity of suspension eyedrops depends on their homogeneity immediately before administration. Among the formulation factors studied, particle size appears to be the most important. The various redispersion rates of the three drugs underline their clinical profile.

TI  - Determination of the hydrocarbon core structure of fluid dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC) bilayers by x-ray diffraction using specific bromination of the double-bonds: effect of hydration.  
AB  - Changes in the structure of the hydrocarbon core (HC) of fluid lipid bilayers can reveal how bilayers respond to the partitioning of peptides and other solutes (Jacobs, R. E., and S. H. White. 1989. Biochemistry. 28:3421-3437). The structure of the HC of dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC) bilayers can be determined from the transbilayer distribution of the double-bonds (Wiener, M. C., and S. H. White. 1992. Biophys. J. 61:434-447). This distribution, representing the time-averaged projection of the double-bond positions onto the bilayer normal (z), can be obtained by means of neutron diffraction and double-bond specific deuteration (Wiener, M. C., G. I. King, and S. H. White. 1991. Biophys. J. 60:568-576). For fully resolved bilayer profiles, a close approximation of the distribution could be obtained by x-ray diffraction and isomorphous bromine labeling at the double-bonds of the DOPC sn-2 acyl chain (Wiener, M. C., and S. H. White. 1991. Biochemistry. 30:6997-7008). We have modified the bromine-labeling approach in a manner that permits determination of the distribution in under-resolved bilayer profiles observed at high water contents. We used this new method to determine the transbilayer distribution of the double-bond bromine labels of DOPC over a hydration range of 5.4 to 16 waters per lipid, which reveals how the HC structure changes with hydration. We found that the transbilayer distributions of the bromines can be described by a pair of Gaussians of 1/e half-width A(Br) located at z = +Z(Br) relative to the bilayer center. For hydrations from 5.4 waters up to 9.4 waters per lipid, Z(Br) decreases from 7.97 +/- 0.27 A to 6.59 +/- 0.15 A, while A(Br) increased from 4.62 +/- 0.62 A to 5.92 +/- 0.37 A, consistent with the expected hydration-induced decrease in HC thickness and increase in area per lipid. After the phosphocholine hydration shell was filled at approximately 12 waters per lipid, we observed a shift in Z(Br) to approximately 7.3 A, indicative of a distinct structural change upon completion of the hydration shell. For hydrations of 12-16 waters per lipid, the bromine distribution remains constant at Z(Br) = 7.33 +/- 0.25 A and A(Br) = 5.35 +/- 0.5 A. The absolute-scale structure factors obtained in the experiments provided an opportunity to test the so-called fluid-minus method of structure-factor scaling. We found that the method is quite satisfactory for determining the phases of structure factors, but not their absolute values.

TI  - Biofluid mechanics.  
AB  - The flow behavior of biological fluids in living organisms plays a crucial role in determining the state of the tissue through which they flow. Biofluid mechanics, the study of the fundamentals of biological fluid flow, has been recognized to be extremely important for the understanding of how changes in the flow behavior within living tissue maybe affect both the fluid and the tissue. Fluids in living tissue include blood, water, air and bodily fluids of animals, as well as the fluids in plants. The movement and balance of forces in resting fluids and fluids in motion are among the basic subjects for research. Biofluid mechanics is a field whose importance to the field of bioengineering has increased over the last two decades as pharmaceuticals, biomaterials and non-invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures create changes in the fluid mechanics of biofluids. Biofluid mechanics is a complex field including one of the most important areas of study--blood flow and cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Effect of green tea on p53 mutation distribution in ultraviolet B radiation-induced mouse skin tumors.  
AB  - In the present study, administration of green tea to SKH-1 mice, via the drinking fluid, was found to significantly reduce the incidence and volume of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation-induced skin tumors. Thirty-six skin tumors induced by UVB and 32 skin tumors induced by UVB, in mice treated with green tea in their drinking water, were collected and examined for the presence of mutations in the p53 gene. Polymerase chain reaction products from p53 exons 5-8 were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequence analyses. Eight of 36 UVB-induced tumors contained nine p53 mutations, with four in exon 5 and five in exon 8. In contrast, nine of 32 UVB-induced tumors in mice treated with green tea contained 11 p53 mutations, with two in exon 5, five in exon 6 and four in exon 8. All of the p53 mutations occurred at dipyrimidine sequences. These results were further corroborated by p53 immunohistochemistry. The most frequent mutations were C-->T or T-->C transitions, which are consistent with the genetic alterations caused by UVB exposure. Interestingly, mutations found in exon 6 of the p53 gene occurred only in tumors from the UVB/green tea group. Thus, the tumors observed in UVB/green-tea-treated mice have a different exon distribution of p53 mutations than tumors obtained from mice treated with UVB alone.

TI  - Dilated fallopian tubes: MR imaging characteristics.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of hydrosalpinx and the accuracy of MR imaging for distinguishing hydrosalpinx from other adnexal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-referencing of pathologic records and MR studies from two institutions disclosed 41 study patients with surgically proved dilated fallopian tubes. A set of 38 patients with surgically evaluated adnexal masses, but no hydrosalpinx, were randomly chosen as control subjects. All MR examinations included T1-weighted spin-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo imaging in multiple planes with a phased-array multicoil. Two blinded readers scored each adnexa for the presence of a dilated fallopian tube or thickened tubal wall and mucosal folds and the signal intensity of the intratubal fluid. Blinded readings were compared with surgical findings of dilated fallopian tube, endometriosis, and salpingitis. Radiologic-pathologic correlation was performed with adnexal specimens imaged in vitro in three study patients. RESULTS: On a per patient basis, the blinded readers correctly identified dilated fallopian tubes in 31 of 41 study patients and correctly excluded dilated tubes in a mean 34 of 38 control subjects. On T1-weighted images, hyperintense tubal fluid was significantly correlated with the presence of endometriosis in the pelvis at surgery (P < .002, chi 2). CONCLUSION: MR imaging can depict most dilated fallopian tubes and differentiate them from other adnexal masses on the basis of morphologic features. On T1-weighted images, high signal intensity is correlated with the presence of endometriosis affecting the tube.

TI  - Sequence-related behaviour of transmembrane domains from class I receptor tyrosine kinases.  
AB  - 2H NMR spectroscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy were used to compare the transmembrane domains of two Class I protein receptor tyrosine kinases (the EGF receptor and Neu/erbB-2) regarding overall behaviour in fluid lipid bilayer membranes. The 34-residue peptide, EGFRtm, was synthesised to contain the 23 amino acid hydrophobic stretch (Ile622 to Met644) thought to span the membrane of the human EGF receptor, plus the first 10 amino acids (Arg645 to Thr654) of the cytoplasmic domain. Deuterium probes replaced selected 1H nuclei at sites corresponding to Ala623, Met644, and Val650. The 38-residue peptide, Neutm, was synthesised having the 21 residue hydrophobic stretch (Ile660 to Ile680) calculated to span the membrane in rat Neu/erbB-2, plus residues Lys681 to Thr691 of the contiguous cytoplasmic domain. Deuterium probes replaced selected 1H nuclei at Ala661, Leu667, and Val676. A third peptide, Neutm*, was also prepared, corresponding to the transmembrane domain of a constitutively-activating Neu/erbB-2 transformant in which Val664 is replaced by Glu: it was deuterated in a manner identical to Neutm. Peptides were studied by 2H NMR spectroscopy at 1 mol% and 6 mol% in unsonicated fluid bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and in POPC containing 33 mol% cholesterol, over the range 12 degrees to 65 degreesC. Overall motion was found to be different for each of the three peptides under a given set of conditions. EGFRtm spectra were characteristic of axially symmetric motion in membranes of POPC alone, and in POPC/cholesterol at 35 degreesC and above. In contrast, spectra of the transmembrane peptides, Neutm and Neutm*, were characteristic of significantly axially asymmetric motion under all conditions studied (and regardless of sample preparation method). Addition of 33% cholesterol to membranes was accompanied by spectral changes consistent with increased formation of peptide dimers/oligomers in all cases. The transformant peptide, Neutm*, showed greater spectral evidence of immobilisation than did the wild type - probably reflecting a greater tendency to form large oligomers. Sequence-related details within the transmembrane domains of Class I receptor tyrosine kinases appear to exert important control over their associations within membranes. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the NMR samples demonstrated their liposomal nature. Peptide-related intramembranous particles (IMPs) were present which likely represent oligomers of the transmembrane peptide. IMP size and distribution were similar under a given set of conditions for all three peptides, suggesting that the differences seen by NMR spectroscopy reflect structures smaller than the 2 nm resolution limit of freeze-fracture EM and peptide relationships within its 20 nm accuracy of identifying lateral position.

TI  - [Airway hypersecretion and mucociliary dysfunction in asthma]  
AB  - Mucociliary transport function can be determined by ciliary motility of airway epithelial cells, the amount and physicochemical properties of airway surface fluid, and the airway integrity. Mucus glycoprotein is released from submucosal glands and goblet cells in response to a variety of stimuli and, on other hand, water is secreted by airway epithelial cells through the movement of electrolytes. Marked airway goblet cell hyperplasia has been found in patients who died of severe asthma, indicating that goblet cell hypersecretion may play a significant role in the formation of mucus plugs in the respiratory tract. Goblet cell secretion is regulated by autonomic nerves and various chemical mediators associated with asthma. Antigen challenge causes an increase in mucus discharge from goblet cells in ovalbumin-sensitized animals, and this effect can be greatly inhibited by an histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Similarly, histamine released by antigen challenge stimulates airway epithelial Cl secretion and, hence, water secretion toward the airway lumen. There is ample evidence that mucociliary clearance is impaired in patients with asthma, which results in deterioration of airflow limitation. The precise mechanism for this impairment remains uncertain, but bronchospasm and the increased mucus secretion induced by peptide leukotrienes may be involved.

AB  - PURPOSE: We studied which irrigating fluid, glycine 1.5% or mannitol 3%, is associated with the most favorable adverse effects profile when absorbed by the patient during transurethral resection of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Irrigating fluid bags containing mannitol 3% or glycine 1.5%, both with added ethanol 1% as an indicator of fluid absorption, were used in a randomized double-blind fashion during 394 transurethral prostatic resections. The incidence of 13 symptoms was studied in 52 patients (13%) who absorbed more than 500 ml. fluid. RESULTS: The incidence of circulatory symptoms did not differ between the fluids but the risk of neurological symptoms, such as nausea, after transurethral prostatic resection was 4.8 times higher when glycine 1.5% was absorbed (p <0.04). An increase of 1,000 ml. in the volume of irrigant absorbed increased the overall risk for circulatory symptoms by a factor of 3.4 (p <0.03) and the risk of neurological symptoms by a factor of 4.4 (p <0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Absorption of mannitol 3% during transurethral prostatic resection is associated with fewer neurological symptoms than glycine 1.5%.

TI  -  Crevicular fluid analysis around two failing dental implants: a clinical report.  
AB  - The criteria for monitoring tissue health around endosseous implants remain subjective. Disagreement about which clinical measures of peri-implant health are of diagnostic value continues because of the complexity of the disease process and lack of validated measures of peri-implant health. Crevicular fluid analysis of various inflammatory mediators has been investigated as a means of providing objective criteria of tissue health. In this clinical report, the crevicular fluid levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), an inflammatory cytokine, were used to provide an objective measure of the peri-implant health and the effectiveness of treatment for a patient with two failing implants. The measurement of IL-1 beta may be an important supplement to clinical findings in establishing a diagnosis of peri-implantitis.

TI  - Characterization of a 14 kDa plant-related serine protease inhibitor and regulation of cytotoxic activity in earthworm coelomic fluid.  
AB  - We have purified and characterized the serine protease inhibitor activity contained in the coelomic fluid of the earthworms, Eisenia. Serine protease inhibitor activity was stable between pH3 and 9.5, not flocculable by pH 3.0 and resistant to 100 degrees C for 15 min. or to 4 degrees C for 24 h. Ten microL of coelomic fluid was sufficient to inhibit in vitro the protease activity of 0.12 microgram of trypsin. Injection of living bacteria into earthworms resulted in increased serine protease activity 1-2 days post-injection, and increased serine protease inhibitor activity on day 4, suggesting that serine protease inhibitor is responsible for serine protease neutralization. Purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on trypsin, the serine protease inhibitor of Eisenia is a monomer of 14 kDa. Its partial NH2 amino acid sequence revealed a basic hydrophobic fragment which shared 68-75% homologies and 47-60% identities with several plant serine protease inhibitors. Eisenia cytotoxic activity due to the two fetidins of 40 and 45 kDa was stimulable in vitro by several serine proteases. Incubation with soybean trypsin inhibitor variant a (STIa) resulted in less cytotoxicity. The inhibitory effect occurred only when STIa was added before cell disruption. Interpretative cytotoxic scheme involving the release of intracellular cytotoxic proteins, intracellular trypsin-like activator and extracellular serine protease inhibitor suggests regulatory mechanisms for cellular/humoral immune system of earthworms.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha response and herpesvirus infection in Bell's palsy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To attempt early diagnosis of patients with Bell's palsy by detection of herpesviral DNA in body fluids, and to investigate whether tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine associated with demyelination, is involved in the inflammatory response in this disease. STUDY DESIGN: Eleven patients with acute facial palsy admitted within 1 week after onset of the disease were followed in a consecutive prospective study. METHODS: Antibodies reactive to herpesviruses were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples from acute and convalescent (> 2-week interval) cases. Intrathecal antibody response was investigated by immunoblotting. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of herpesviral DNA was attempted from samples of serum, cerebrospinal fluid, tear fluid, and saliva TNF-alpha and its soluble receptors (types I and II) were assessed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 patients demonstrated serologic evidence of herpesviral primary infection or reactivation, supporting the evidence that herpesviruses are the most prevalent etiologic agents in Bell's palsy. Despite this, DNA amplifications by polymerase chain reaction were negative for herpesviruses in the body fluids tested. TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly elevated in serum, as compared with controls. Only one patient had a remaining facial nerve dysfunction at follow-up after 3 months. CONCLUSION: The absence of herpes DNA in body fluids in the acute stage of serologically confirmed Bell's palsy suggests that viral replication is transient in cases with an early restoration of the facial nerve function. The elevated serum levels of TNF-alpha indicate that this cytokine might be a pathogenetic factor related to the demyelination in this disease.

TI  - Treatment of reopened macular hole after vitrectomy by laser and outpatient fluid-gas exchange.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess a new nonsurgical treatment for patients who have previously undergone vitrectomy for macular hole with either persistent or reopened holes. DESIGN: A prospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients (15 eyes) were studied. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated by an outpatient method consisting of laser photocoagulation to the foveal pigment epithelium followed by fluid-gas exchange with 20% perfluoropropane gas and prone positioning. Patients without known allergy were treated with two doses of oral Diamox (250 mg) and ciprofloxacin (500 mg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anatomic status of the macular hole, and cataract were the principal outcome measures studied. RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 macular holes were closed successfully with 1 or more procedures. All patients with macular hole closure achieved two lines or greater of vision improvement on Snellen testing. Three patients (20%) achieved 20/40 and nine (60%) achieved 20/80 or better. Three patients required more than one procedure. Four patients developed mild transient ocular hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of office-based outpatient fluid-gas exchange and laser appears to be a safe and cost-effective alternative to repeat surgery in selected patients with persistent or reopened macular holes after vitrectomy, in whom there are no visible epiretinal membranes, or in whom return to the operating room is undesirable for medical or personal reasons.

TI  - Mortality studies of metalworking fluid exposure in the automobile industry: VI. A case-control study of esophageal cancer.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results are reported from a nested case-control study of 60 esophageal cancer deaths among 46,384 automobile manufacturing workers potentially exposed to metalworking fluids (MWF) in machining and grinding operations. METHODS: By using incidence-density sampling, controls were selected with a sampling ratio of 20:1 from among co-workers who remained at risk by the age of death of the case, matched on race, gender, plant, and year of birth. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk associated with cumulative exposure (mg/m3-years) to each of three types of metalworking fluid (straight, soluble, and synthetic MWF), as well as with years of exposure to selected components of MWF, including nitrosamines, sulfur, biocides, and several metals. RESULTS: Esophageal cancer was found to be significantly associated with exposure to both soluble and synthetic MWF in grinding operations. The odds ratios (ORs) for grinding with soluble MWF were elevated at 2.5 or greater in all categories of cumulative exposure, although the exposure-response trend was statistically significant only when exposure was measured as duration. Those with 12 or more years exposure to soluble MWF in grinding operations experienced a 9.3-fold relative risk of esophageal cancer mortality (95% CI = 2.1-42.1). The OR for ever grinding with synthetic MWF was 4.1 (95% CI = 1.1-15.0). Elevated risk was also associated with two agents found in both synthetic and soluble fluids, nitrosamines, and biocides. For exposure to nitrosamines, the OR was 5.4 (95% CI = 1.5-19.9); for biocides the OR was 3.8 (95% CI = 0.8-18.9). However, because the same workers were exposed to grinding with synthetics, nitrosamines and biocides, it was not possible to separate the specific risks associated with these components.

TI  - Does labetalol predispose to pulmonary edema in severe pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease?  
AB  - We investigated whether use of labetalol, a beta adrenoreceptor blocking antihypertensive agent commonly employed as an alternative to hydralazine, is independently associated with pulmonary edema in women with severe preeclampsia. We retrospectively evaluated women with severe preeclampsia who were given labetalol by intravenous bolus for MAP > 120 mm Hg. Outcome variables included: achieving MAP < 120 mm Hg with < 300 mg of labetalol, incidence of adverse effects of the drug, including pulmonary edema, hypotension, and maternal bradycardia. Total intravenous fluid intake exceeding output (+ delta I/O) and presence or absence of preeclamptic liver involvement were noted. Statistical analysis included unpaired t-tests and Fisher's exact test. Fifty-one women were studied, 7 (13.7%) of whom developed pulmonary edema. Demographic and pregnancy characteristics were not different between patients who did or did not develop pulmonary edema. No patient had detectable underlying heart disease. Patients with or without pulmonary edema did not differ as regards entry MAP (130 +/- 14 vs. 129 +/- 18 mm Hg), total dose of labetalol (209 +/- 83 vs. 193 +/- 39 mg/24 hours), incidence of bradycardia or hypotension (0/7 vs. 8/44), or presence of hepatic involvement (1/7 vs. 9/44). However, there was a significant difference in degree of positive fluid balance. Patients developing pulmonary edema had a net gain of 1,466 +/- 429 mL of fluid in the 24 hours in which they received labetalol than those who did not (659 +/- 1152 mL, P = .003). Initial central hemodynamic monitoring data revealed no impairment of cardiac performance (mean cardiac output 7.7 +/- 1.8 L/min, cardiac index 4.0 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2, left ventricular stroke work index 73 +/- 9 g.m.m-2) despite high pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (22 +/- 4 mm Hg). We conclude that the incidence of pulmonary edema in patients with severe preeclampsia who are treated with labetalol appears to be a result of an increase in third space fluid accumulation as a manifestation of the severity of their disease, not a direct effect of the drug on cardiac performance.

TI  - Effect of concentration on albumin diffusion in lung interstitium.  
AB  - The transport of macromolecules through the lung interstitium depends on both bulk transport of fluid and diffusion. In the present study, we studied the diffusion of albumin. Isolated rabbit lungs were inflated with silicon rubber via airways and blood vessels, and two chambers were bonded to the sides of a 0.5-cm-thick slab that enclosed a vessel with an intersititial cuff. One chamber was filled with either albumin solution (2 or 5 g/dl) containing tracer 125I-albumin or with tracer 125I-albumin alone; the other was filled with Ringer solution. Unbound 125I was removed from the tracer by dialysis before use. The chamber with Ringer solution was placed in the well of a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. Diffusion of tracer through the interstitium was measured continuously for 60 h. Tracer mass (M) showed a time (t) delay followed by an increase to a steady-state flow (dM/dt constant). Albumin diffusion coefficient (D) was given by L2/(6T), where T was the time intercept of the steady-state M-t line at zero M, and L was interstitial length. Interstitial cuff thickness-to-vessel radius ratio (Th0/R) was estimated by using Fick's law for steady-state diffusion. Both D and Th0/R were independent of albumin concentration. D averaged 6.6 x 10(-7) cm2/s, similar to the free D for albumin. Values of Th0/R averaged 0.047 +/- 0.024 (SD), near the values measured histologically. Thus pulmonary interstitial constituents offered no restriction to the diffusion of albumin.

TI  - Free echogenic pelvic fluid: correlation with hemoperitoneum.  
AB  - Echogenic fluid is an important extrauterine finding of ectopic pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurately echogenic fluid correlates with hemoperitoneum at surgery. Transvaginal sonography was performed in 831 consecutive patients referred to rule out ectopic pregnancy over a 36 month period. Scans were retrospectively evaluated for the presence or absence and echogenicity of free pelvic fluid. Subsequently, 185 patients had a laparotomy or laparoscopy and had documentation of the presence or absence of hemoperitoneum. On transvaginal sonography 125 patients had echogenic fluid, 30 patients had anechoic fluid, and 30 patients had no fluid. Of the 125 patients with echogenic fluid, 122 (98%) patients had hemoperitoneum; none of the patients with anechoic fluid or no detected fluid had hemoperitoneum (0%). Echogenic fluid had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 98%, and an accuracy of 98% for detecting hemoperitoneum. This study demonstrates that echogenic fluid detected by transvaginal ultrasonography accurately correlates with hemoperitoneum detected at surgery in patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy.

TI  - A possible role for saliva as a diagnostic fluid in patients with chronic pain.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The focus of this review was on proteins and peptides found in saliva. Of greatest interest were those neuropeptides relevant to nociception and to the pathogenesis of chronic pain syndromes. An additional goal was to develop a standardized protocol to collect saliva for laboratory assessment. METHODS: Data were obtained through discussion with experts at the medical schools in San Antonio and Heidelberg and a Medline literature search involving all relevant studies from 1966 to 1997. The literature search was based on the following key terms: saliva, serotonin, neuropeptide, substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and nerve growth factor (NGF). RESULTS: The mean concentration of SP in the saliva of healthy normal controls ranged from 9.6 to 220 pg/mL. Generally, the concentration of SP was approximately three times higher in saliva than in plasma. In a number of painful conditions, particularly tension headache, substantial elevations of salivary SP were found. Mean values for salivary CGRP in healthy controls were approximately 22 pmol/L and were significantly elevated in patients with migraine attacks or cluster headache. There were no data to indicate prior quantitative determination of NGF in human saliva. CONCLUSIONS: After sampling and processing techniques have been standardized, measurement of neuropeptides in human saliva could provide a valuable tool for study of patients with chronic painful disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and even fibromyalgia syndrome.

TI  - Nitric oxide as a modulator of intestinal water and electrolyte transport.  
AB  - The role of nitric oxide in intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion depends upon whether the conditions under study are physiological or pathophysiological. In physiological conditions, endogenous nitric oxide seems to be a proabsorptive molecule, based on the findings that nitric oxide synthase inhibitors reverse net fluid absorption to net secretion in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. This proabsorptive mode involves the enteric nervous system, the suppression of prostaglandin formation, and the opening of basolateral K+ channels. However, in some pathophysiological states nitric oxide synthase may be produced at higher concentrations that are capable of evoking net secretion. Thus nitric oxide synthase contributes to the diarrheal response in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced ileitis in guinea pigs and is the mediator of the laxative action of several intestinal secretagogues including castor oil, phenolphthalein, bisacodyl, magnesium sulfate, bile salts, senna, and cascara in the rat. Corresponding with the in vivo results, nitric oxide-donating compounds or nitric oxide itself stimulate chloride secretion in the guinea pig and rat intestine in vitro. Exceptions are the diarrhea produced by bacterial enterotoxins in the rat, in which nitric oxide seems to have a proabsorptive role, and the mouse ileum in vitro, in which nitric oxide-donating compounds produce a net proabsorptive effect on basal ion transport. Several endogenous secretagogues (substance P, 5-hydroxytryptamine, interleukin-1beta), which are important mediators of the inflammatory bowel diseases, act, at least in part, through the liberation of nitric oxide. Clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide is elevated in several inflammatory bowel diseases and other secretory conditions including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, toxic megacolon, diverticulitis, infectious gastroenteritis, and infantile methemoglobinemia. However, the determination of nitric oxide in secretory diarrhea per se does not give conclusive information on the nitric oxide contribution to clinical secretory diarrhea.

TI  - Pelvic extension of retroperitoneal fluid: analysis in vivo.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to describe the pathway of fluid flow from the retroperitoneal space into the pelvic extraperitoneal space on CT in vivo, to clarify the relation between its occurrence and the site or amount of retroperitoneal fluid, and to delineate the anatomic relation between the retroperitoneal spaces and the pelvic extraperitoneal space. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the CT scans of 37 patients with retroperitoneal fluid collections. Patients who had undergone pelvic laparotomy and patients who had either fascial thickening alone or fluid within muscle (such as the psoas muscle or iliac muscle) alone were excluded. RESULTS: Fluid extension into the pelvic extraperitoneal space was seen in six patients (16%). Extension by the infrarenal extraperitoneal space was seen in all six of these patients, but extension by properitoneal fat was seen in only one of the six patients. In patients with large amounts of fluid in the infrarenal extraperitoneal space, we frequently saw extension into the pelvic extraperitoneal space. Extension of pancreatic fluid into the infrarenal extraperitoneal space occurred in only 15% of the 37 patients. However, it occurred in both patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three pathways from the infrarenal extraperitoneal space into the pelvic extraperitoneal space were seen: extension dorsally medial to the iliac vessels (n = 6), extension dorsally lateral to the iliac vessels (n = 1), and extension medially into the prevesical space (n = 2). Coexistence of two of these three pathways was seen in three patients. CONCLUSION: In vivo, extension of retroperitoneal fluid into the pelvic extraperitoneal space is not rare and occurs more often by the infrarenal extraperitoneal space than by properitoneal fat. Extension of retroperitoneal fluid to the infrarenal extraperitoneal space can be attributed less frequently to sources distant to the pelvic cavity such as pancreatic fluid. Such extension often derives from sources that can produce large amounts of retroperitoneal fluid such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Of the three pathways from the infrarenal extraperitoneal space to the pelvic extraperitoneal space, dorsal extension medial to the iliac vessels is the most common, and multiple pathways often coexist.

TI  - Lipid uptake in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The mechanisms of vascular prosthesis failure are reported to be associated, in part, with an atherosclerotic degenerative process that is related to an abnormal lipid infiltration. The lipid uptake in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts was reproduced in vitro, and the effect of time on the permeability of these prostheses was studied. METHODS: Water permeability tests were carried out under dynamic flow conditions at various hydrostatic pressures. Lipid uptake was simulated by circulating a phosphatidylcholine suspension inside an expanded Teflon prosthesis under pulsatile or continuous transmural pressure ranging between 80 mm Hg and 180 mm Hg, at a flow rate of 500 mL/min and 2000 mL/min, for a duration ranging from 2 hours to 1 month. RESULTS: Water permeability tests indicated that under hydrostatic pressures of 180 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg, water percolated through the prosthesis wall after an exposure of 720 minutes and 75 minutes, respectively. After exposing the prostheses to the lipid dispersion under the various flow conditions, the fluid convection through the wall occurred. Preferential convection pathways with a constant periodicity were observed across the length of each prosthesis and were, therefore, associated with regularly spaced perforations depicted in the structure of the devices. Phospholipids gradually agglomerated within the prosthesis wall, allowing a restrictive molecular mobility. Infrared spectroscopy results indicated that the lipid uptake depended on the transmural pressure and time of exposure. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of the membrane permeability may be associated with the dilatation and plastic deformation of the prosthesis. Lipid uptake occurs in ePTFE grafts after an aggressive kinetic process.

TI  - PAF levels in saliva are regulated by inflammatory cells.  
AB  - Platelet activating factor (PAF), a powerful inflammatory phospholipid mediator, has been detected in normal human saliva and found to be increased in periodontitis. The cellular source of PAF in saliva is controversial although several data suggest an origin related to the presence of inflammatory cells. PAF levels in biological fluids are regulated by PAF-producing cells and by the PAF-degrading acetylhydrolase. Although in normal human saliva acetylhydrolase activity is very low, no information is available on the levels of this enzyme in inflammatory conditions of the mouth. The aim of our study was to assess the contribution of inflammatory cells to the levels of PAF in saliva in normal subjects and in patients with periodontitis. PAF was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in mixed uncentrifuged saliva and in cell-free saliva from healthy subjects, before and after tooth brushing, and in patients with periodontitis. In healthy subjects PAF levels were significantly higher in whole saliva than in centifuged saliva (1.51 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.04 ng/ml, p < 0.0039). A significant increase in the amount of PAF was detected in whole saliva, but not in centifuged saliva, 2 h after tooth brushing. In patients with periodontitis PAF levels were not different from those of healthy individuals when using centrifuged saliva but were significantly higher when using whole, uncentrifuged saliva. Exogenous radiolabelled PAF was degraded much more rapidly by the saliva of periodontitis patients than by that of normal subjects. In conclusion, our study shows that inflammatory cells regulate the levels of PAF in saliva contributing to its production and degradation. The differential degradation of PAF in normal and inflammatory saliva highlights the absolute need of a series of methodological precautions when performing studies on salivary PAF.

TI  - Angiotensin AT1 receptor-mediated excitation of rat carotid body chemoreceptor afferent activity.  
AB  - 1. A high density of angiotensin II receptors was observed in the rat carotid body by in vitro autoradiography employing 125I-[Sar1, Ile8]-angiotensin II as radioligand. Displacement studies demonstrated that the receptors were of the AT1 subtype. 2. The binding pattern indicated that the AT1 receptors occurred over clumps of glomus cells, the principal chemoreceptor cell of the carotid body. Selective lesions of the sympathetic or afferent innervation of the carotid body had little effect on the density of receptor binding, demonstrating that the majority of AT1 receptors were intrinsic to the glomus cells. 3. To determine the direct effect of angiotensin II on chemoreceptor function, without the confounding effects of the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II, carotid sinus nerve activity was recorded from the isolated carotid body in vitro. The carotid body was superfused with Tyrode solution saturated with carbogen (95 % O2, 5 % CO2), maintained at 36 C, and multi-unit nerve activity recorded with a suction electrode. 4. Angiotensin II elicited a dose-dependent excitation of carotid sinus nerve activity (maximum increase of 36 +/- 11 % with 10 nM angiotensin II) with a threshold concentration of 1 nM. The response was blocked by the addition of an AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (1 microM), but not by the addition of an AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123319 (1 microM). 5. In approximately 50 % of experiments the excitation was preceded by an inhibition of activity (maximum decrease of 24 +/- 8 % with 10 nM angiotensin II). This inhibitory response was markedly attenuated by losartan but not affected by PD123319. 6. These observations demonstrate that angiotensin II, acting through AT1 receptors located on glomus cells in the carotid body, can directly alter carotid chemoreceptor afferent activity. This provides a means whereby humoral information about fluid and electrolyte homeostasis might influence control of cardiorespiratory function.

TI  - Detection of drugs of abuse in nails.  
AB  - Postmortem toenail samples were used for the detection of cocaine (COC), benzoylecgonine (BZE), norcocaine (NCOC), cocaethylene (CE), morphine (MOR), 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), codeine (COD), and hydrocodone (HDC). After the toenail clippings were washed with methanol, they were solubilized in 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 5.0). The drugs of interest, along with internal standards, were isolated by solid-phase extraction followed by derivatization with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide. The derivatized products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry operated in the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The limit of quantitation for all analytes was 0.3 ng on column. The quantities of drugs found in toenails of each of 46 decedents were compared with those of their corresponding postmortem fluids. The toenails of the 46 decedents were tested for COC, BZE, NCOC, and CE, and 34 of the collected samples were also tested for opiates. COC and BZE concentrations ranged from 0.20 to 140.17 (n = 20) and 0.30 to 315.44 ng/mg (n = 21), respectively. NCOC concentrations of 6.78 and 0.66 ng/mg and CE concentrations of 2.60 and 0.73 ng/mg were detected in two of the decedents' toenails. MOR and 6-MAM were detected in three sets of toenails at average concentrations of 0.37 and 0.89 ng/mg, respectively. COD was detected in two sets of specimens at concentrations of 3.07 and 1.02 ng/mg. HDC (0.62 ng/mg) was found in only one set of specimens.

TI  - Effects of colloidal resuscitation fluids on reticuloendothelial function and resistance to infection after hemorrhage.  
AB  - The effects of three resuscitation fluids, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), Haemaccel, and fresh autologous blood, on reticuloendothelial system phagocytic and catabolic functions and resistance to infection after 40% hemorrhages in BALB/c mice were studied. The mice, anesthetized with isoflurane, were bled over a 10-min period, left hypovolemic for 30 min, and then resuscitated with their shed blood or the same volume of asanguineous fluid. Normothermia was maintained throughout the experiments. The uptake and catabolism of intravenously injected double-labelled sheep erythrocytes (51Cr-125I-SRBC) in liver and spleen were determined at 1 and 48 h after hemorrhage. No significant changes in the uptake or catabolism of SRBC in liver or spleen were found at 1 h after hemorrhage and resuscitation with any of the fluids. However, at 48 h a significant increase in liver uptake of SRBC was seen in animals resuscitated with either Haemaccel or HES compared to that in animals resuscitated with shed blood or in animals subjected to a sham operation. The increase in liver uptake was accompanied by a small decrease in spleen uptake in animals resuscitated with Haemaccel but not with HES. No great changes in catabolic activity were seen at 48 h, although activity levels tended to be higher in animals resuscitated with Haemaccel. Separate groups of animals were challenged by an intraperitoneal injection with live Escherichia coli at 1 or 48 h after hemorrhage and resuscitation. Sixty-four percent of the animals resuscitated with shed blood survived the challenge with E. coli at 1 h after hemorrhage, whereas only 10 and 0% survival was seen for animals resuscitated with Haemaccel and HES, respectively. At 48 h survival was 80% for shed-blood-resuscitated animals and 60 and 70% for Haemaccel- and HES-resuscitated animals, respectively.

TI  - Changes in intramucosal pH and gut blood flow during whole body heating in a porcine model.  
AB  - Heat stroke is a syndrome which reduces systemic vascular resistance and cardiac collapse. The gut plays an important role in shock. In hyperthermia, many of the same symptoms as heat stroke may be present, including inhibition of splanchnic vasoconstriction and endotoxemia. Furthermore, both conditions result in shock, in which the gut plays an important role. Detection of insufficient oxygenation of gut tissue, which sustains an earlier and more severe hypoxia, can warn of impending shock and can be performed by monitoring intramucosal pH (pHim). This index is very sensitive to tissue hypoxia and ischemia. In the present study both pHim, using tonometry, and gut blood flow during whole body heating (WBH) in pigs were measured. WBH was achieved by circulating warm water through a vinyl sheet covering the animal. Central venous pressure was maintained by fluid infusion. Body temperature was measured using a thermometer probe inserted into the right jugular vein. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and gut blood flow were also measured. pHim was evaluated using a tonometer placed into the midileum lumen. During WBH, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure increased, however systemic vascular resistance decreased. Gut blood flow was either maintained at the normal rate or increased. Intraarterial pH did not change significantly, however pHim significantly decreased from 7.30 at the beginning of WBH to approximately 7.05 after the body temperature reached 42.5 degrees C. These findings suggest that there was reduced oxygen delivery to the tips of the small intestinal villi during regional ischemia following WBH. In conclusion, insufficient tissue oxygen delivery as detected by a reduction in inramucosal pH is an important index in whole body heating.

TI  - A psychophysical study of discomfort produced by repeated filling of the urinary bladder.  
AB  - Psychophysical studies were performed in 10 healthy, female volunteers using urinary bladder distension (UBD) as a visceral stimulus. Stimulus methodology was similar to that used clinically for obtaining cystometrograms with a fixed-rate (100 cc/min normal saline) filling of the urinary bladder, occasional pauses and simultaneous measure of bladder pressure using a catheter-transducer assembly. During bladder filling, subjects were asked to report sensations by verbal report and by using an electronic, hand-held, visual-analog-scale device. Sensations evoked by UBD were generally localized to the suprapubic region. UBD produced cardiovascular responses which increased with repeated trials. Sensation intensity increased with repeated UBDs as indicated by global pain ratings. Intravesical pressure and volume correlated with sensation intensity. The volume of distending fluid needed to produce a report of discomfort was highly variable from trial to trial and did not change significantly with repeated UBDs. The intravesical pressure which produced a report of discomfort was less variable and significantly decreased with repeated UBDs. The change in intravesical pressure and volume needed to produce discomfort was inversely correlated with initial intravesical pressure measures. Similar to findings in other organ systems, these findings demonstrate that repeated presentations of a visceral stimulus may lead to an increase in physiological and perceptual responses to pain.

TI  - Correction of pressure waveforms recorded by fluid-filled catheter recording systems: a new method using a transfer equation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pressure measuring systems using fluid-filled catheters can result in the recording of distorted pressure waveforms. It results in phase delay, overestimation of systolic and, to a lesser extent, of diastolic pressure. We designed and evaluated a method to correct this pressure waveform distortion using an appropriate transfer equation obtained from the dynamic response of the fluid-filled catheter. This transfer equation is based on the principle that a fluid-filled catheter recording system is considered as an underdamped dynamic system fully characterized by its natural frequency (omega n) and damping ratio (zeta). METHODS: Pressure waveforms, simultaneously recorded in vitro or in vivo by a fluid-filled catheter (Pc) and a micromanometer-tipped catheter (Pref), were used to validate the method. Dynamic response of the catheter used was obtained from a fastflush test. The corrected signal (Ppred) was obtained using omega n, zeta and the following transfer equation: d2Pc/dt2 + 2 omega n zeta dPc/dt + omega n 2Pc = C Ppred (t) After correction of Pc, Ppred was compared, using a linear regression, with Pref taken as reference. RESULTS: Our results showed that Ppred was fitted to Pref with excellent coefficient correlation (0.99). The mean error and the standard error of estimate were respectively -1.16 mmHg and 1.4 mmHg. CONCLUSION: This new method can convert the distorted pressure waveforms transmitted by any fluid-filled catheters into high-fidelity signals. It suppresses the phase delay and the over-estimation of systolic pressure induced by fluid-filled catheters.

TI  - Blister fluid for the diagnosis of subepidermal immunobullous diseases: a comparative study of basement membrane zone autoantibodies detected in blister fluid and serum.  
AB  - The subepidermal immunobullous diseases bullous pemphigoid (BP), cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), pemphigoid gestationis (PG) and linear IgA disease (LAD) are characterized by circulating and in vivo deposition of antibodies to antigens in the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect immunofluorescence (IMF) of serum is a routine diagnostic test to detect circulating BMZ antibodies in these diseases. We have compared the titres of IgG and IgA and their subclasses, also of IgM and IgE BMZ antibodies in serum and aspirated blister fluid in 35 adult patients with subepidermal immunobullous diseases: BP (n = 30), PG (n = 2), CP (n = 1), and LAD (n = 2), by indirect IMF on intact and salt-split skin. The antibody titre in blister fluid was the same or one dilution less than serum in most cases and there was no significant difference between these results (P > 0.05). IgG1 and IgG4 were the predominant subclasses in both blister fluid and serum in BP. Indirect IMF of serum and blister fluid was also carried out on trypsinized epidermal cells in a subgroup of patients with BP (n = 19). Typical polar fluorescence was obtained in all 14 cases which had positive indirect IMF on intact and split skin. Our findings demonstrate that blister fluid can be used as an alternative to serum for indirect IMF in subepidermal immunobullous diseases. This avoids the need for venesection and has a practical application in children and those with poor venous access.

TI  - Transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections without electrocautery using the Seldinger technique [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complications of endoscopic transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections arise from entry through the gastrointestinal wall. We describe transmural drainage of these collections using the Seldinger technique without electrocautery. METHODS: From January 1995 to September 1997, we attempted endoscopic transmural drainage of 94 consecutive pancreatic fluid collections without EUS guidance (needle-knife entry in 51, Seldinger entry technique in 43). Success of entry and complications were compared. RESULTS: Successful entry was achieved in 95.3% using the Seldinger technique and 92.1% using the needle-knife entry technique (p = NS). Complications of bleeding and perforation were seen in 4.6% of patients in the Seldinger group and 15.7% in the needle-knife entry group. CONCLUSIONS: The Seldinger technique of endoscopic transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections appears effective and safer than entry using the needle-knife. Collections as small as 3 cm in diameter can be entered using the Seldinger technique without EUS guidance.

TI  - A longitudinal brain MRI study comparing the sensitivities of the conventional and a newer approach for detecting active lesions in multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - Monthly dual-echo spin-echo (SE) and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the injection of a standard dose (SD) of gadolinium (Gd) is the conventional approach to monitor short-term disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, the sensitivity of this approach in detecting active lesions in MS was compared with that of monthly fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans associated with enhanced MRI after the injection of a triple dose (TD) of Gd. Thirteen patients with relapsing-remitting MS entered the study. Monthly MRI scans were obtained on four occasions in two separate sessions (interval between 12 and 24 h). In one session, dual-echo conventional SE and SD Tl-weighted scans were obtained; in the other, fast-FLAIR and TD Tl-weighted scans. The order of the two sessions was randomized. Three observers counted the number of active lesions detected by each of the two approaches. One hundred and four active lesions were detected by the conventional approach and 199 by the newer approach (average increase per patient = 75%, range = 0-325%). The mean number of active lesions per month per patient was 2.0 for the conventional approach and 3.8 for the new approach (P = 0.004). Scans with active lesions were 34/52 (65%) with the conventional approach and 37/52 (71%) with the new approach. Our data indicate that the combined use of monthly fast-FLAIR and TD enhanced Tl-weighted scans increases the number of active lesions detected on serial MRI scans from patients with MS.

TI  - Accumulation of salicylic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in phloem fluids of cucumber during systemic acquired resistance is preceded by a transient increase in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity in petioles and stems.  
AB  - Cucumber (Cucumis sativa) leaves infiltrated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae cells produced a mobile signal for systemic acquired resistance between 3 and 6 h after inoculation. The production of a mobile signal by inoculated leaves was followed by a transient increase in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in the petioles of inoculated leaves and in stems above inoculated leaves; with peaks in activity at 9 and 12 h, respectively, after inoculation. In contrast, PAL activity in inoculated leaves continued to rise slowly for at least 18 h. No increases in PAL activity were detected in healthy leaves of inoculated plants. Two benzoic acid derivatives, salicylic acid (SA) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA), began to accumulate in phloem fluids at about the time PAL activity began to increase, reaching maximum concentrations 15 h after inoculation. The accumulation of SA and 4HBA in phloem fluids was unaffected by the removal of all leaves 6 h after inoculation, and seedlings excised from roots prior to inoculation still accumulated high levels of SA and 4HBA. These results suggest that SA and 4HBA are synthesized de novo in stems and petioles in response to a mobile signal from the inoculated leaf.
