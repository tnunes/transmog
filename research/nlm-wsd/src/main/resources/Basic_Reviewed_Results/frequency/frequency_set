TI  - Fronto-occipital EEG power gradients in human sleep.  
AB  - The brain topography of power spectra along the antero-posterior (A-P) axis was studied in the all-night human sleep EEG. Spectra (0.25 - 25.0 Hz) were computed for an anterior (A; F3-C3), a middle (M; C3-P3) and a posterior (P; P3-O1) bipolar derivation, and the spectral gradients between two adjacent derivations were expressed by power ratios (A/M and M/P). At NREM-REM sleep transitions a power shift from A to M was present over almost the entire frequency range, while the direction of shifts between M and P differed between frequency bands. Within NREM sleep, frequency specific power gradients were present: In the low delta band power in both A (0.25 Hz bin) and P (0.25-1.0 Hz bins) was higher than in M. In the 4-9 Hz range the relation was A > M > P, and in the 15 - 25 Hz range power was largest in M. Power in the spindle frequency range was highest at 11.75 Hz in M, and at 13.5 - 13.75 Hz in A. Topographical differences were seen also in the temporal changes of power across and within NREM sleep episodes. Whereas NREM sleep power in the 2-Hz bin was higher in A than in M in the first episode, this difference vanished in the course of the night. This result points to a specific involvement of frontal parts of the cortex in sleep homeostasis. The regional differences in sleep EEG spectra indicate that sleep is not only a global phenomenon but also a local brain process with a different regional involvement of neuronal populations.

TI  - Association of HLA-DR, DQ genotype with different beta-cell functions at IDDM diagnosis in Japanese children.  
AB  - Japanese IDDM patients have been demonstrated to have unique and different HLA associations from white patients. To elucidate the effect of HLA-associated genetic factors on the clinical heterogeneity of IDDM in Japanese people, HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 genotypes in 88 childhood-onset Japanese IDDM patients were examined by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) or sequence-specific primers (SSP). Of the 88 IDDM patients, 26 (29.5%) had DRB1*0405-DQA1*0302-DQB1*0401/X (DR4-DQ4/X), 38 (43.2%) had DRB1*0901-DQA1*0302-DQB1*0303/X (DR9-DQ9/X), and 9 (10.2%) were DR4/9-DQ4/9 heterozygous in the present study (X does not contain protective alleles). Clinical heterogeneity such as age distribution at onset, prevalence and serum level of anti-GAD antibodies (GADAb), and residual pancreatic beta-cell function after diagnosis were compared between patients with HLA-DR4-DQ4 and DR9-DQ9.  The frequency of DR9-DQ9 genotype was significantly higher in the younger (0-10 years) than in the older (11-16 years) age-group of onset, but the frequency of DR4-DQ4 was higher in the older (11-16 years) age-group. Although no association of DR-DQ genotypes with the prevalence and serum level of GADAb was found among newly diagnosed patients, long-standing DR9-DQ9 patients had significantly higher levels of GADAb than those with DR4-DQ4. While no difference in time course of serum C-peptide (CPR) levels was detected between GADAb+ and GADAb- patients, a remarkable difference was demonstrated between DR9-DQ9 and DR4-DQ4 patients. The residual pancreatic beta-cell function was retained more in patients with DR4-DQ4 than in those with DR9-DQ9 at diagnosis through 12-18 months after diagnosis. These results suggest that the DR9-DQ9 genotype may induce stronger autoimmune destructive response (T-helper 1 function) against target beta-cells than the DR4-DQ4 genotype does. Our findings may warrant further studies on the association of diabetogenic autoimmune response with HLA class II molecules and contribute to a clarification of interracial differences in HLA-encoded susceptibility to IDDM.

TI  - Gender effects on submaximal energy expenditure in children.  
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that submaximal energy expenditure relative to body mass during weight-bearing exercise may be greater in boys compared to girls. This two-part study examined a) gender-related five-year longitudinal changes in submaximal walking economy and b) gross, net, and delta muscle work efficiency during submaximal cycle exercise in a cross-sectional analysis of boys and girls. In the longitudinal study, the influence of pre-exercise metabolic expenditure, stride frequency, and substrate utilization (by RER) on changes in economy were examined. During the five years, mean VO2 per kg during submaximal treadmill walking (measured at 8% slope, 3.25 mph) decreased 16% in girls and 13% in boys (p > 0.05 for gender). Likewise, no significant gender differences were observed in decline of stride frequency over time. RER values were similar between sexes except in the final two years when girls had significantly greater values than the boys. No gender-related differences were observed in any measure of muscle work efficiency. This study failed to reveal significant gender differences in utilization of energy during submaximal exercise in children.

TI  - Clinical significance of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in young individuals during orthodontic treatment. A 3-year longitudinal study.  
AB  - The aim of the present study was: (1) to assess longitudinally the occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) in young subjects wearing fixed orthodontic appliances compared to matched appliance-free controls; (2) to determine whether the presence of the micro-organism at baseline could influence the periodontal status assessed 3 years later. 70 subjects, 27 male and 43 female, aged between 12 and 20 years participated in the study: 35 subjects under orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances for at least 6 months, and 35 appliance-free individuals matched for age and gender. All subjects were free of clinically demonstrable loss of attachment. They all received oral hygiene instructions 2x during the 2 months preceding the first clinical and microbiological examination. No subgingival instrumentation was performed between baseline and the 3-year examination. Clinical parameters included gingival bleeding index (GBI), pocket probing depth (PPD) and measurements of attachment level (AL). Statistically significant differences were reported regarding frequency of detection of Aa between both groups at each examination. The %s of orthodontic subjects infected with Aa at the baseline and at the 3-year examination were 86% and 80%, respectively, while the corresponding figures for control subjects were 16.6% and 26.6%. The frequency distribution of %s of Aa in the total anaerobic subgingival flora among control subjects remained fairly stable, whereas the proportion of orthodontic subjects yielding Aa at a concentration > or = 1.0% dropped significantly from 32% at baseline to 19% at the 3-year visit. Calculations of the relative risk for increasing GBI and PPD in both groups when Aa was present at baseline, revealed that the orthodontic subjects positive for Aa had a negligible relative risk of experiencing worse periodontal conditions compared to orthodontic patients where Aa was not detected at baseline. In contrast, control subjects initially infected with Aa presented with a risk for increased GBI 6.6x higher than that for subjects without Aa. In conclusion, the present study confirmed previous cross-sectional findings reporting that young individual with an integer periodontium wearing fixed orthodontic appliances harbor Aa with a statistically significant greater frequency than appliance-free matched controls. However, although orthodontic patients exhibited more inflammation, their deteriorated clinical conditions could not be accounted for by the sole presence of Aa in their sulci. In contrast, appliance-free young subjects initially infected with Aa had a higher risk of experiencing more gingival inflammation than subjects without the bacterium during a 3-year observation period.

TI  - Inhibition of bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation produced by noxious cutaneous and visceral stimuli and its modulation by vagal activity [published errata appear in J Neurophysiol 1998 Mar;79(3):preceding 1135 and 1998 Jun;79(6):3301]  
AB  - Intrathecally applied nicotine reduces bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation (BK-induced PE) in the rat knee joint. This depression is mediated by the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and is enhanced by interruption of impulse traffic in afferents of the abdominal vagus nerve. Like intrathecal nicotine, electrical stimulation of unmyelinated cutaneous fibers also depresses BK-induced PE, which is also dependent on an intact HPA axis. In this study, we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of intrathecal nicotine can be mimicked by noxious stimulation of skin and of viscera. Furthermore we determined whether this depression is potentiated after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Stimulation of visceral afferents in the peritoneum, by intraperitoneal capsaicin injection, dose-dependently decreased BK-induced PE. The capsaicin dose-response function was shifted by 1.5-2 orders of magnitude to the left after vagotomy. Stimulation of visceral afferents in the urinary bladder by capsaicin also dose-dependently reduced BK-induced PE, which similarly was potentiated after vagotomy. Transcutaneous stimulation of unmyelinated nociceptive afferents from the plantar skin of the paw depressed BK-induced PE. This depression had a threshold of approximately 0.25 Hz and was maximal at a stimulation frequency of approximately 1 Hz. After subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, the stimulus response function shifted to the left and the inhibition was significantly larger than in control, in the range of 0.125-1 Hz stimulation. These results show that noxious stimulation of skin and viscera depressed BK-induced PE and that such depression was potentiated after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in a manner similar to that of intrathecally applied nicotine. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that intrathecal nicotine depresses BK-induced PE by exciting spinal nociceptive neurons or the central projections of nociceptive primary afferent neurons.

TI  - Recreation and risk: potential exposure.  
AB  - The Department of Energy and other federal facilities are reclaiming land through the process of remediation and restoration, and this land will eventually be turned over for future land uses that may involve recreation. Understanding the amount of recreation that is likely (and thus individual exposure) is an essential element in decisions about cleanup standards. In this article the number of days people engage in different recreational activities as a measure of potential exposure is examined. People attending a Mayfest celebration (n = 399) and the Palmetto Sportsmen's Classic (n = 285) in Columbia, SC, were interviewed regarding their recreational activities. In most cases reported in the literature, recreational activities are examined as the mean number of days people engage in each activity per year, but to determine risk it is essential to know the distribution of these activities. In descending order of frequency, people attending the Mayfest reported their activities as birdwatching, photographing, fishing, hiking, camping, and hunting. There were significant gender differences in the frequency of activities, with men spending more days in every activity except birdwatching and photography. There were ethnic differences in recreation, with whites engaging in higher levels of most recreational activities than blacks, but the percentage of black men who reported fishing more than 100 d per year was greater than for white men. Most people reported their participation in most activities less than 30 d per year; however, a higher percentage of people reported participating in photography, birdwatching, and fishing more than 30 d per year compared to the other activities. Further, individuals at the Sportsman's Classic reported far higher rates of hunting and fishing per year than the general public. These data can be used to examine potential exposure of recreationists on remediated and restored land. The data clearly indicate that over 25% of the people engage in at least one recreational activity over 20 d per year, and thus exceed the Department of Energy's 14-d recreation assumption in its future land use document.

TI  - Trans gene regulation in adaptive evolution: a genetic algorithm model.  
AB  - This is a continuation of earlier studies on the evolution of infinite populations of haploid genotypes within a genetic algorithm framework. We had previously explored the evolutionary consequences of the existence of indeterminate-"plastic"-loci, where a plastic locus had a finite probability in each generation of functioning (being switched "on") or not functioning (being switched "off"). The relative probabilities of the two outcomes were assigned on a stochastic basis. The present paper examines what happens when the transition probabilities are biased by the presence of regulatory genes. We find that under certain conditions regulatory genes can improve the adaptation of the population and speed up the rate of evolution (on occasion at the cost of lowering the degree of adaptation). Also, the existence of regulatory loci potentiates selection in favour of plasticity. There is a synergistic effect of regulatory genes on plastic alleles: the frequency of such alleles increases when regulatory loci are present. Thus, phenotypic selection alone can be a potentiating factor in a favour of better adaptation. Copyright 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Spontaneous mutation frequencies and spectra in p53 (+/+) and p53 (-/-) mice: a test of the 'guardian of the genome' hypothesis in the Big Blue transgenic mouse mutation detection system.  
AB  - TSG-p53/Big Blue double transgenic mice offer a powerful tool for examining the effect of a p53 germline mutation on spontaneous somatic mutation in vivo. After sequencing the DNA-binding domain of the lacI gene, we previously reported no differences in mutant frequency between p53 nullizygous (-/-) and p53 wild-type (+/+) mice in liver, spleen and brain. However, jackpot mutations elsewhere in the gene may have obscured a real difference in mutation frequency and the small sample size of mutations not at CpG dinucleotides (n = 23) may have been insufficient to reveal differences in mutation spectra. Herein we have sequenced the entire lacI gene, including the promoter and lacZ operator regions. 123 additional independent mutations have been found including 70 mutations not at CpG sites. The mutation frequency was determined by correcting for jackpot mutations. There were no statistically significant differences in mutation frequency or spectrum between the p53 (+/+) and p53 (-/-) genotypes in any of the three tissues.

TI  - Antibody alone does not prevent experimental cytomegalovirus retinitis in mice with retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency (MAIDS).  
AB  - Passive-transfer studies were performed to assess the ability of antibody alone to reduce the frequency and/or severity of necrotizing retinitis caused by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in C57BL/6 mice with retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS). Initial experiments showed a gradual decline in the ability of mice to initiate humoral immunity during the evolution of MAIDS so that neither MCMV-specific IgM nor IgG could be detected during late-stage MAIDS. Passively administered hyperimmune MCMV immunoglobulin, however, could be detected within the serum of mice with MAIDS for at least 9 days after intraperitoneal injection and protected these animals in preliminary experiments from systemic MCMV disease and death when administered 24 h prior to intraperitoneal challenge with a lethal dose of virus. Nonetheless, passive transfer of hyperimmune MCMV serum to mice with MAIDS failed to reduce intraocular MCMV titers, frequency of retinitis, or severity of retinitis when administered 24 h prior to subretinal MCMV inoculation. Whereas whole eyes of MAIDS animals that received normal mouse serum and were injected subretinally with MCMV had an ocular MCMV titer of 4.3 log10 and a frequency of retinitis of 89% (severity score = 55%), whole eyes of antibody-treated mice with MAIDS had an ocular MCMV titer of 4.3 log10 and a frequency of retinitis of 87% (severity score = 57 %). Passive transfer of a neutralizing MCMV-specific monoclonal antibody also failed to reduce the frequency or severity of MCMV retinitis when administered to mice with MAIDS prior to subretinal MCMV inoculation. Our findings suggest that antibody immunotherapy alone will not be effective therapeutically for cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS.

AB  - AIM: To determine the frequency, time of occurrence and factors associated with the failure of the permanent peritoneal catheter during dialysis in cases of chronic renal failure (CRF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort under a nested case control design was studied at a second level health care unit of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. A total of 149 catheters, double cushion straight Tenckhoff type, were evaluated in 74 patients with CRF due to diabetic nephropathy in 36/74 patients (49%). Information concerning functionality time and causes of catheter failure as well as the clinical and technical factors concerning insertion were obtained from the clinical chart. RESULTS: The cumulated time of dialysis was 814 months. Catheter failure occurred in 101 cases (68%): 67 due to obstruction, 24 due to infection, to leakage in 6 and to other causes in 4. Those of non-infectious origin were more frequent (p < 0.01). In the first month post-insertion there was a higher number of failures than after one month, (p < 0.0005). The global functionality of the catheter at one month, one and two years was 55%, 31% and 16%, respectively. There was a greater permanence of the catheters in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis than in intermittent peritoneal dialysis (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the frequency of the peritoneal catheter failure was high; that the most frequent cause was due to non-infectious complications during the first month of insertion; and the factor associated to catheter failure was intermittent peritoneal dialysis as compared to continuous ambulatory dialysis.

TI  - High-frequency ultrasonic detection of thrombi with a targeted contrast system.  
AB  - Site-targeted acoustic contrast agents used in conjunction with high-frequency intravascular ultrasound have the potential to localize and characterize intravascular pathology. The present study quantifies the utility of a novel, site-targeted ultrasonic contrast agent with high-frequency ultrasound (30 to 50 MHz) and demonstrates the feasibility of the new agent for augmenting detection of targeted pathology with intravascular ultrasonic catheters. High-frequency acoustic microscopy was used to image avidinconjugated nitrocellulose membranes after exposure to a control or biotinylated contrast agent. Increases (p < 0.05) in backscattered power of approximately 66 dB (4-fold) were found for the biotinylated, but not the control contrast agent. Intravascular ultrasonic images (30 MHz nominal center frequency) of plasma clots after exposure to the targeted contrast agent were brighter (p < 0.05) than in controls. These results demonstrate high-frequency acoustic enhancement with a novel targeted contrast agent and may extend the potential diagnostic spectrum of intravascular ultrasound.

TI  - Conformation of the trypanocidal pharmaceutical suramin in its free and bound forms: transferred nuclear overhauser studies.  
AB  - Suramin is a lead compound for treatment of cancer, HIV, and trypanosomiasis. The conformations of suramin in its free form and bound to phosphoglycerate kinases from T. brucei and S. cerevisae, have been studied in aqueous solutions using nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and transferred NOE NMR spectroscopies. The NOE data of the free drug can be accommodated by a model in which many of the single bonds of suramin are unrestricted at room temperature, consistent with molecular mechanics calculations. The angle between the naphthalene ring and the adjoining amide is essentially locked by a strong amide-sulfonate hydrogen bond into one preferred conformation. Another degree of freedom near the termini of the molecule has a rather pronounced preference, and a third exhibits a nearly perpendicular arrangement between the amide and adjacent aromatic ring. The other two degrees of freedom have weaker preferences. Molecular mechanics calculations using AMBER force field and charges on amides and sulfonates obtained from semiempirical or ab initio calculations reproduced the extent of nonplanarity but not the detailed preferences. 13C spin-lattice relaxation, proton NOE, and light-scattering measurements for free suramin indicate that the correlation time of the molecule is approximately 3 ns at 5 mM concentration, suggesting that suramin is multimeric. Lowering the temperature to 5 degrees C causes a dramatic broadening of all of the resonances in the NMR spectra of 5 mM suramin. This broadening probably is associated with further aggregation into micelles. Suramin is monomeric at 0.5 mM and room temperature, and the NOE cross-relaxation rate constants are close to the cancellation condition for a 500 MHz proton frequency; this concentration is typical of blood serum concentrations when the drug is utilized in humans. Changes in the conformational preferences for terminal degrees of freedom are observed in the bound states of suramin based upon the transferred NOE data. The data for the bound state cannot be accommodated by a symmetric conformer. Analysis of the transferred NOESY buildup curves indicates complex kinetics of binding, probably involving an electrostatically bound encounter complex. Despite the weak binding constant, the buildup curves cannot be treated as population-weighted averages of the free and bound cross-relaxation rates, and therefore complete relaxation-exchange matrix analysis has been performed to simulate the data sets.

TI  - [Modulated extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation of low intensity activates or inhibits respiratory burst in neutrophils depending on modulation frequency]  
AB  - The influence of low-intensity modulated electromagnetic radiation of extremely high frequencies (EHF EMR) on synergistic reaction of calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol ester PMA in activation of the respiratory burst of the peritoneal neutrophils of mice line NMRI was investigated. The production of reactive oxygen species by the neutrophils was estimated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence technique. The cells were irradiated in the far field zone of the channel radiator for 20 min in the presence of A23187 and then were activated by PMA after switching off the irradiation. It was shown, that continuous EHF EMR (50 microW/cm2) inhibited quasi-resonantly the synergistic reaction. The maximum effect was about 25% at carrier frequency of 41.95 GHz. Modulated radiation with carrier frequency of 41.95 GHz and modulation frequency of 1 Hz activated the synergistic reaction, but at modulation frequencies of 0.1, 16 and 50 Hz inhibited one. At fixed modulation frequency of 1 Hz the nonlinear dependence of the effect on the carrier frequency was found. The synergistic reaction was activated in the frequency range of 41.95-42.05 GHz and was inhibited at the frequencies of 41.8-41.9 GHz. The effect was observed only at raised intracellular free calcium concentration and at calcium fluxes through plasma membrane. The obtained results prove the possibility of control over cell functioning by low-intensity modulated EHF EMR, presumably, manipulating by connected systems of enzyme reactions.

TI  - [Anatomical and clinical effects of neoadjuvant hormonal treatment before radical prostatectomy]  
AB  - Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment before radical prostatectomy is designed to reduce the positive margin rate and therefore the risk of recurrence. It usually consists of complete androgen blockade for 3 months, but no consensus has been reached concerning the type of blockade and the optimal duration. The main histological changes consist of glandular atrophy with pycnosis and vacuolization of tumour cells. These changes could reflect increased apoptosis. The residual tumour is usually small. PIN become rare, raising the problem of possible chemoprevention. The overall result is a markedly increased frequency of intracapsular tumours and a reduction of at least 50% of positive margins. However, some authors consider that this is simply due to a more detailed histological examination. The frequency of seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement does not appear to be modified. Endocrine therapy could act on the apoptosis-proliferation balance and also decrease the number of circulating cells. However, the intermediate results of randomized studies are contradictory. As improvement in overall survival remains the main objective, only a longer follow-up will be able to clearly determine the value or uselessness of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment before radical prostatectomy.

TI  - Phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ oscillations in canine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.  
AB  - Modulation of [Ca2+]i in response to receptor activation is a critical determinant of vascular smooth muscle tone. In this study, we examined the effect of continuous stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors with phenylephrine (PE) on [Ca2+]i in single pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) cultured from explants of canine intrapulmonary artery. Fura 2-loaded PASMCs pretreated with propranolol (5 mumol/L) were continuously superfused with PE at 37 degrees C on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope, and [Ca2+]i was measured using a dual-wavelength spectrofluorometer. Resting values of [Ca2+]i were 96 +/- 4 nmol/L. PE (10 mumol/L) stimulated oscillations in [Ca2+]i at a frequency of 1.35 +/- 0.07/min, which reached a peak [Ca2+]i of 650 +/- 26 nmol/L (n = 69 cells). The oscillations lasted for > 30 minutes and were constant in amplitude and frequency. Both the amplitude and frequency of PE-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations increased in a dose-dependent (3 x 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L) manner. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (50 nmol/L) or removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the repetitive [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by PE. The voltage-operated Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1 mumol/L) and verapamil (1 mumol/L) had no effect on the [Ca2+]i oscillations. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 (10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L) attenuated the oscillations in a dose-dependent fashion. The nonselective protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) had a minimal inhibitory effect on the oscillations. Caffeine (30 mmol/L) and thapsigargin (1 mumol/L) abolished the oscillations, whereas pretreatment with ryanodine (1 to 100 mumol/L) had no effect. In freshly dispersed PASMCs, PE (10 mumol/L) induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i similar to those observed in cultured cells, and patch-clamp experiments revealed oscillations in membrane potential. These results indicate that PE induces [Ca2+]i oscillations in PASMCs via stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors coupled to phospholipase C activation. Voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and protein kinases are not required for the oscillations. The requirement for extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular Ca2+ stores indicates that both Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release play a role in the maintenance of the oscillations.

TI  - Standard and multifrequency tympanometry in normal and otosclerotic ears.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this study was to evaluate alternative tympanometric parameters for distinguishing normal middle ears from ears with otosclerosis. A secondary goal was to provide guidelines and normative data for interpreting multifrequency tympanometry obtained using the Virtual 310 immittance system. DESIGN: Nine tympanometric measures were examined in 68 normal ears and 14 ears with surgically confirmed otosclerosis. No subjects in either group had a history of head trauma or otoscopic evidence of eardrum abnormalities. Two parameters, static admittance and tympanometric width, were derived from standard low-frequency tympanometry and two parameters, resonant frequency and frequency corresponding to admittance phase angle of 45 degrees (F45 degrees), were derived from multifrequency tympanometry. RESULTS: Differences between normal and otosclerotic ears were statistically significant only for resonant frequency and F45 degrees. Group differences in resonant frequency were larger when estimated using positive tail, rather than negative tail, compensation. Group differences in both resonant frequency and F45 degrees were larger when estimated from sweep frequency (SF), rather than sweep pressure, tympanograms. Test performance analysis and patterns of individual test performance point to two independent signs of otosclerosis in the patient group; 1) an increase in the stiffness of the middle ear, best indexed by F45 degrees derived from SF recordings, and 2) a change in the dynamic response of the tympanic membrane/middle ear system to changes in ear canal pressure, best indexed by tympanometric width. Most patients were correctly identified by only one of these two signs. Thus, optimal test performance was achieved by combining F45 degrees derived from SF recordings and tympanometric width. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the advantage of multifrequency tympanometry over standard low-frequency tympanometry in differentiating otosclerotic and normal ears. Recommendations for interpreting resonant frequency and F45 degrees measures obtained using the Virtual Immittance system are also provided. In addition, the relationship among different tympanometric measures suggests a general strategy for combining tympanometric measures to improve the identification of otosclerosis.

There is considerable evidence that achieved control is relatively independent of the means or frequency of insulin delivery provided at least two injections per day are used, probably due to a combination of the unphysiological nature of insulin absorption profiles, the poor reproducibility of insulin absorption in any individual, and the erratic nature of normal human behavior.

TI  - Intensive insulin therapy in clinical practice.  
AB  - Achieving optimal blood glucose control, without an unacceptable rate of hypoglycaemia or unacceptable restrictions on lifestyle, is not simple with presently available insulin preparations and monitoring tools. There is considerable evidence that achieved control is relatively independent of the means or frequency of insulin delivery provided at least two injections per day are used, probably due to a combination of the unphysiological nature of insulin absorption profiles, the poor reproducibility of insulin absorption in any individual, and the erratic nature of normal human behavior. Accordingly the appropriate use of insulin to obtain good metabolic control requires the continued and informed expertise of both patient and advising professional, but also attention from both to self-motivation in order to make the desired lifestyle changes possible. Newer approaches to insulin delivery will continue to demand a high level of understanding and expertise to make them effective, until such time as automatic minute-to-minute control of insulin delivery can be restored.

TI  - The effects of frequency region and bandwidth on the temporal modulation transfer function.  
AB  - Temporal resolution was examined as a function of frequency region and listening region. The first experiment demonstrated that amplitude- and frequency-modulated tones are not appropriate stimuli to study temporal resolution as a functional of frequency region, due to the availability of other cues in addition to temporal ones. In the other experiments, thresholds for detection of sinusoidal amplitude modulation of a noise band were measured as a function of frequency region, bandwidth, and level of surrounding notched noise masker. Temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) measured in low- and high-frequency regions did not differ in sensitivity or in cutoff frequency, suggesting that initial "critical band" filtering did not affect temporal resolution. When the upper cutoff frequency of the noise was held constant, TMTF sensitivity increased with noise bandwidth, while the cutoff frequency of the TMTF did not show measurable change. These results are consistent with the predictions of an envelope detector model if peripheral filtering in the lower-frequency range is assumed to be approximately twice as wide as that estimated by measuring thresholds for a tone in notched noise. Restricting the listening region with notched noise increased thresholds for low modulation frequencies but not for high. This is consistent with other data showing that upward spread of excitation may increase the effective modulation depth, but only for low modulation frequencies.

TI  - Mechanisms of infarction in the superficial posterior cerebral artery territory.  
AB  - Numerous reports have described a variety of clinical syndromes resulting from posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarction, whereas only a few pathoanatomical and retrospective clinical studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms. Therefore we attempted to determine the causes of infarction in the superficial posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory by means of a more comprehensive, modern vascular and cardiac study. During a 4-year period 74 consecutive patients (49 men, 25 women) with acute PCA infarction documented on CT (n = 74) and MRI (n = 41) were included in the study. Patients had a neurological examination, vascular studies [extra- and transcranial Doppler (n = 74), magnetic resonance (n = 31) or intra-arterial (n = 22) angiography], cardiac evaluation [ECG (n = 74), transthoracic (n = 74) and transoesophageal echocardiography (n = 30)], and coagulation tests. A cardiac source of embolism was established in 31%, significant vertebrobasilar artery disease in 22%, and PCA stenosis or occlusion in 8% of the patients. Rare causes, such as hypercoagulopathy or paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale, were present in 15%. However, in spite of the comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, the cause of the stroke remained undetermined in 24% of the cases. Apart from complete infarcts of the posterior branches of the PCA, which occurred more frequently in cardioembolic strokes (18%, P < 0.05), the topographical patterns of infarct extension and the coincidence of infarction in the deep territories of the PCA, the cerebellum and brainstem were not significantly different among the causal subgroups.  The frequency of haemorrhagic transformation (18%) was highest among cardioembolic strokes (44%, P < 0.001). This prospective study of PCA infarction demonstrated embolism from cardiac and vascular sources as the predominant cause. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence of migraine as a cause of PCA infarction, whereas paradoxical embolism was the presumed cause in a considerable number of cases. Whereas the cause of stroke could not reliably be derived from infarct topography, haemorrhagic transformation indicated there had been cardioembolism in most cases.

TI  - Noise suppression digital filter for functional magnetic resonance imaging based on image reference data.  
AB  - The central decision in every functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment is whether pixels in brain tissues are showing activation in response to neural stimulus or as a result of noise. Images are degraded not only by random (e.g., thermal) noise, but also by structured noise due to MR system characteristics, cardiac and respiratory pulsations, and patient motion. A novel digital filter has been developed to suppress cardiac and respiratory structured noise in fMRI images, using estimates of structured and random noise power spectra obtained directly from the images. It is an adaptive filter based on stationary noise statistics, and is equivalent in form to a Wiener filter. A mathematical model of the filtering process was developed to understand how the strength and distribution of structured and random noise power influenced filter performance. The filter was tested using images from an auditory activation study in ten subjects. In subjects whose structured noise power was localized to a relatively narrow frequency range, a strong relationship was found, both experimentally (R = 0.975, P < 0.0004 for H0: R = 0) and using the model, between filter performance and the level of structured noise power contaminating the experiment frequency. The filter significantly reduced the rate of false-positive activations in the subset of subjects whose experiment frequency was relatively heavily contaminated by structured noise. Notch filters, that simply eliminate unwanted frequencies, performed poorly in all subjects. Unlike the proposed Wiener filter, these filters did not suppress structured noise power at the experiment frequency that contributes to false-positive activations.

TI  - Invasive hemodynamics and force-frequency relationships in open- versus closed-chest mice.  
AB  - We compared hemodynamics, ventricular function, and force-frequency relationships in six open-chest and six closed-chest anesthetized mice (FVB/N strain). Left ventricular (LV) pressure was measured with a 1.8- or 1.4-Fr Millar catheter placed via the right carotid artery and the LV apex in the closed- and open-chest state, respectively. Pacing was performed with electrodes placed either directly on atrial appendages (open chest) or with a 1-Fr bipolar catheter via the jugular vein (closed chest). Closed-chest animals had greater spontaneous heart rate (267 +/- 106 vs. 147 +/- 27 beats/min), LV systolic (81 +/- 14 vs. 48 +/- 9 mmHg) and diastolic pressures (11.2 +/- 4.8 vs. 5.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg), and maximal rise (+ dP/dtmax: 6,208 +/- 2,519 vs. 3,682 +/- 671 mmHg/s) and fall in pressure development (-dP/dtmax: -6,094 +/- 2,386 vs. -3,001 +/- 399 mmHg/s). LV systolic pressure (98 +/- 18 vs. 52 +/- 11 mmHg), + dP/dtmax (9,240 +/- 2,459 vs. 5,777 +/- 2,473 mmHg/s), and -dP/dtmax (-8,375 +/- 2,551 vs. -3,753 +/- 1,170 mmHg/s) were significantly higher when animals were matched at a heart rate of 420 beats/min in closed-chest vs. open-chest animals. Biphasic force-frequency relationships were seen in all animals, but the critical heart rate was greater in the closed- than open-chest animals (432 +/- 42 vs. 318 +/- 42 beats/min). We conclude that 1) there are significant differences between invasive indexes of systolic and diastolic function between the closed- and open-chest preparations, 2) there is a biphasic force-frequency relationship in the anesthetized mouse, and 3) dP/dtmax can be used to assess the cardiovascular phenotype.

TI  - Initial drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Taiwan.  
AB  - The prevalence and mortality rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults are high in Taiwan. Because the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is one of the major causes of this sustained high tuberculosis mortality, surveillance of initial drug resistance is important. We tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 1,935 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients from January 1990 through December 1995 at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau. The overall initial drug resistance rate was 12.3%; 8.7% of isolates were resistant to only one drug, 2.6% to two drugs, 0.7% to three drugs, and 0.3% to four drugs. The resistance rates to individual drugs were: streptomycin, 5.7%; isoniazid, 9.2%; ethambutol, 0.7%; and rifampin, 1.5%.  The frequency of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin) was 1.2%. In view of the high initial isoniazid resistance rate and low initial ethambutol resistance rate, ethambutol should be added to the regimen for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in Taiwan. The emergence of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis is ominous and should be considered when treating patients in Taiwan.

In particular, childhood thyroid cancer has increased in both frequency and severity. Other malignant tumors may have also increased, as may have childhood diseases that result from impaired immune function. It is unknown whether these increases in human disease (other than thyroid cancer) are due to improved methods of reporting or to exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition to the medical consequences of radiation damage, there are also significant psychological problems endured by the population living in contaminated areas. The Republic of Belarus has participated in several international programs for the study and management of widespread radiation exposure, and will continue to do so. Programs to address issues of radiation protection and population safety are being implemented wherever possible.

TI  - Multidimensional scaling of complex sounds by school-aged children and adults.  
AB  - A paired-comparisons procedure was used to evaluate the processing of complex, nonspeech sounds by 7- and 10-year-old children and adults. Stimuli were brief duration and included pure tones, harmonic complexes, and bands of noise. From their similarity ratings, a three-dimensional multidimensional scaling solution was derived. Results suggested that listeners classified the stimuli into clusters based upon periodicity and the number of spectral peaks. Within each cluster, the stimuli were ordered according to frequency. Because individual differences in the overall weightings of features were large, separate solutions were derived for two subgroups of listeners, formed based upon similarities in the pattern of dimension weights obtained in the group analysis. One subgroup, for whom the full group analysis captured a large proportion of the variance in the ratings, included the adults, many of the 10-year-olds, and a few of the 7-year-olds. The solution derived for this subgroup suggested that spectral and temporal information were weighted equally and integrated into all dimension weights.  Frequency information was coded but given less weight and was not used for stimulus classification. A second subgroup of listeners included most of the 7-year-old and some of the 10-year-old children. Examination of their data suggested that they relied heavily on an analysis of the signals according to periodicity as was reflected in their temporal fine structure. Also encoded but of lesser importance were aspects of spectral shape and absolute frequency.

AB  - The study objectives were to determine comorbidity rates for various subtypes of specific phobia (SP) in a sample of patients with the principal diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) and to examine the possible etiologic relatedness of these SP subtypes to PDA. Ninety consecutive day clinic patients with PDA were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) modified for DSM-IV. The overall comorbidity rate for SP was 65.6%. The most frequent subtypes of SP were situational phobia and dental phobia, followed by natural environment phobia, phobia of funerals, cemeteries, dead bodies, and other death-related phenomena and objects (referred to as death-related phobia), and blood-injection-injury phobia. Except for death-related phobia, other subtypes of SP clearly tended to precede the onset of PDA, often by many years. The smallest difference between the age of onset for PDA and particular subtypes of SP (temporal distance) was found for death-related phobia, whereas the temporal difference was longer for situational phobia, hospital phobia, and blood-injection-injury phobia.  The frequency and temporal distance data suggest that death-related phobia may constitute a risk factor for developing PDA or that it is a prodrome of PDA, whereas situational phobia, hospital phobia, and blood-injection-injury phobia appear to predispose to PDA to a lesser degree. Of the three broadly conceived groups of SP, mutilation phobias (which include death-related phobia, hospital phobia, blood-injection-injury phobia, and dental phobia) appear most etiologically relevant for PDA, with the group of situational phobias (which also includes the natural environment subtype of SP) being less relevant, and animal phobias showing a negligible etiologic relatedness to PDA.

TI  - Deficits in D-fenfluramine-sensitive pool of brain 5-HT following withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure.  
AB  - Recent head-twitch response (HTR) studies in mice have indicated that withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure produces deficits in CNS conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-HT. In the present study, the ability of 5-HT releaser, d-fenfluramine, was utilized to induce the HTR in mice following abstinence from chronic cocaine exposure. d-Fenfluramine-induced HTR, is a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated phenomenon and its induction frequency can be regarded as an indirect but in vivo measure of basal brain 5-HT concentration. Thus, different groups of mice were injected with cocaine twice daily (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) for either 7 or 13 days. At 24 h after last cocaine injection, the treated mice received d-fenfluramine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the induced HTR (mean+/-SEM) was recorded for the next 30 min. Cocaine attenuated the d-fenfluramine-induced HTR frequency by 30-37% in the 13-day regimen and significant effects were observed from 0.5 mg/kg dose. At 24 h withdrawal in the 7-day cocaine exposure group, the mean HTR frequencies were attenuated, however, they did not achieve statistical significance. Extended abstinence studies (i.e. 24, 48, 72 and 96 h postwithdrawal) from chronic cocaine exposure (0, 0.5 and 5 mg/kg/day for either 7 or 13 days) indicated that in the 7-day exposure group, significant reductions (26, 39 and 22%) in HTR frequency occurred at 48, 72 and 96 h following withdrawal from 0.5 mg/kg cocaine, whereas its 5 mg/kg dose failed to induce a significant effect. In the 13-day exposure group significant reductions in HTR frequency were observed at 24 h abstinence (27%) for the 0.5 mg/kg cocaine dose and at 24 and 48 h for the 5 mg/kg. Overall, these results indicate that abstinence from chronic exposure to cocaine produces enduring deficits in basal 5-HT concentration. Lastly, serotonergic function appears to be uniquely sensitive to chronic administration of low doses of cocaine.

Data were analyzed from a total of 841 females, 623 normal (NN) and 218 carriers (Nn) having 2,231 and 869 records, respectively. Three susceptible (nn) females from two herds were dropped from the analysis because of their small contribution to the total number of records.  Frequency of the recessive PSS allele ranged from .07 to .28 in the nine herds involved in this study. Data were adjusted using Landrace breed-specific adjustments and analyzed with mixed-model derivative-free REML procedures fitting the dams' PSS genotype as a fixed effect in the model. Only females having two or more successive parities were used in the analysis of farrowing interval, resulting in a reduction of total records analyzed to 2,201 (1,564 NN and 637 Nn records) from 632 females (445 NN and 187 Nn females). No differences between NN and Nn dams were observed for adjusted number of pigs born alive, adjusted number of pigs at 21 d, adjusted 21-d litter weight, proportion of pigs surviving to 21 d, and farrowing interval. The results of this investigation indicate no significant maternal performance differences between PSS NN or Nn Landrace dams.

TI  - Detection of increments and decrements in sinusoids as a function of frequency, increment, and decrement duration and pedestal duration.  
AB  - Thresholds for the detection of increments and decrements in level of 70 dB SPL sinusoidal signals were measured as a function signal duration (10, 20, or 200 ms), pedestal duration before the signal (10 ms, 200 ms, or pedestal on continuously) and frequency (250, 1000, or 4000 Hz). The sinusoids were presented in a low-pass filtered background noise with an overall level of 68-69 dB SPL which had two purposes: (1) to mask spectral splatter; (2) to induce an adaptation effect, which caused the continuous 4000-Hz pedestal (but not the other two pedestals) to decay to inaudibility (adaptation). We were particularly interested in determining whether the difference in noise-induced adaptation across frequency would influence the pattern of results. Seven normal-hearing subjects were used. Thresholds improved with increasing frequency and with increasing duration for both increments and decrements. However, the effect of increment/decrement duration decreased with increasing frequency; at 4000 Hz thresholds were almost the same for increment durations of 10 and 20 ms. The energy of the increments at threshold increased markedly with increasing increment duration (especially from 20 to 200 ms), suggesting a dominant role for the onsets of the increments as opposed to ongoing differences in level. Increasing the pedestal duration before the increment from 10 to 200 ms slightly improved thresholds for increment and decrement durations of 10 and 20 ms. Increment thresholds were similar for the gated and continuous pedestals at all frequencies, even though the 4000-Hz continuous pedestal decayed to inaudibility. However, thresholds for 200-ms increments were somewhat lower for continuous than for gated pedestals, and supplementary experiments found a larger gated-continuous difference for pedestals presented in quiet. Making the pedestal continuous adversely affected performance for the 10- and 20-ms decrements, but not for the 200-ms decrement. We suggest that the results for decrement detection may be affected by neural long-term adaptation, although they are not clearly related to loudness adaptation.

TI  - Training as an influential factor on the locomotor pattern in Andalusian horses.  
AB  - The physiological and metabolic adaptations to exercise of the Andalusian horse seem to differ slightly from those found in other breeds. The authors studied the locomotor adaptation of 18 Andalusian horses to a training programme in relation to anaerobic energy metabolism, efficacy of the training programme, and changes associated with the onset of fatigue. They also tried to find out if these changes had become diminished by training. Several locomotor variables during trotting and galloping were determined and plasma lactate concentrations were measured before training and after two training periods of different lengths. While trotting after training, an increase in the duration of the restraint phase, a reduction in the propulsion phase and a decrease in the duration and length of step were observed. During galloping, training caused a reduction in stride length but an increase in stride frequency. Significant correlations were obtained between stride duration, frequency and length of step and lactate concentrations. The training might have caused a shift in metabolism from anaerobic to aerobic predominance. This reduction was coupled with a decrease in stride duration, in response to a shorter stance phase duration and an increase in stride frequency. A reduction in the fatigue level was not observed. The study concludes that this training programme was not sufficient for improving the physical capacity of Andalusian horses.

AB  - In order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. In 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. The frequency of Escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). The frequency of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). In the hospital, the frequency of Enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), Acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. The frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4% to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). A significant rise in the resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. In the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. The changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.

TI  - A frequency survey of sugary foods and drinks consumption in school children and adolescents in a West Indian island--Antigua.  
AB  - In 1991, the pattern of sugar consumption in samples of 172 12-year-old children and 231 15-19-year-old adolescents was studied. Twenty-four hour dietary records of five consecutive days were obtained from each subject.  The frequency of total sugary food and drink episodes for children was 3.16 and 3.71 for adolescents. This was mainly accounted for by the consumption of sugary items at meals for both age groups. Students mostly consumed sweetened drinks at meals, especially at breakfast and ate sugary foods between meal times, particularly between lunch and dinner. Sweetened tea and juice were the most popular drinks and confectionery was the most popular snack food.

TI  - Auscultation revisited: the waveform and spectral characteristics of breath sounds during general anesthesia.  
AB  - Although auscultation is commonly used as a continuous monitoring tool during anesthesia, the breath sounds of anesthetized patients have never been systematically studied. In this investigation we used digital audio technology to record and analyze the breath sounds of 14 healthy adult patients receiving general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation. Sounds recorded from inside the esophagus were compared to those recorded from the surface of the chest, and corresponding airflow was measured with a pneumotachograph. The sound samples associated with inspiratory and expiratory phases were analyzed in the time domain (RMS amplitude) and frequency domain (peak frequency, spectral edge, and power ratios). There was a positive linear correlation (R2 > 0.9) between inspiratory flow and sound amplitude in the precordial and esophageal samples of all patients. The RMS amplitude of the inspiratory and expiratory sounds was approximately 13 times greater when recorded from inside the esophagus than from the surface of the chest in all patients at all flows (p < 0.001). The peak frequency (Hz) was significantly higher in the esophageal recordings than the precordial samples (298 +/- 9 vs 181 +/- 10, P < 0.0001), as was the 97% spectral edge (Hz) (740 +/- 7 vs 348 +/- 16, P < 0.0001). In the adult population esophageal stethoscopes yield higher frequencies and greater amplitude than precordial stethoscopes. Quantification of lung sounds may provide for improved monitoring and diagnostic capability during anesthesia and surgery.

TI  - [Difficulties encountered in gathering information on illegal abortion in the population of women]  
AB  - Any attempt to study the practice of illegal abortion faces the problem of asking women about a delicate, sensitive issue that has many implications. This may make it difficult to obtain truthful information on the subject. Results related to methodological aspects are emphasized and their possible association with variables included in a cross-sectional study carried out among 1,955 women, of 15 to 49 years of age is analysed.  The frequency and conditions under which induced abortion was performed in a region of S. Paulo State are investigated. The women were interviewed at home using a pre-tested, structured questionnaire. Most of the women interviewed declared they had never had an abortion nor had they thought of having one, and four percent referred to having had an induced abortion. However, another 16.7 percent said that they had taken tea or medicine at least once to bring on their menses. In this group, most of the women who thought they were pregnant at that time said they had had never an abortion, in spite of having bled after drinking tea or medicine. The results lead to the conclusion that women tend no omit information on the practice of abortion when questioned directly. This is especially true of those who use oral means to bring on their menses and who seemed not to consider this a way of inducing an abortion.

TI  - Characteristics of cervico-ocular responses in the chameleon.  
AB  - The cervico-ocular reflex (COR) was investigated in the chameleon. Two kinds of responses were observed by oscillating the body (sine-wave stimuli) in the fixed-head animal: a "smooth response" of very low gain (around 0.08) and a saccadic response composed of 1-12 saccades per cycle of stimulation (depending on the stimulation frequency). Both responses were elicited in the compensatory direction (same direction as the stimulation) and exhibited a frequency dependence with low-pass properties. The saccadic response was especially developed and displayed a higher gain (up to 0.4) than the smooth response. In darkness, the saccades were triggered near the zero point (head-body alignment), whereas in the presence of a fixed visual surround they were elicited more regularly throughout the stimulation cycle. The amplitude of saccades was increased in the light. Consequently, the gain and the phase lag of the saccadic response were enhanced by the visual input. No visuo-cervical interaction was observed for the smooth response. Oscillating the body at a constant velocity (seesaw or ramp stimuli) revealed a frequency effect on the number of saccades (during a cycle of stimulation), but not on the gain of the response. Increasing the amplitude of oscillations augmented only very slightly the amplitude of saccades and consequently decreased the gain. Hence, the best working range of the saccadic response corresponds to body or head movements of low amplitude (up to +/- 20 deg) and low frequency (up to 0.25 Hz), and is improved by a visual input. These properties are discussed on a comparative point of view. It is proposed that, in chameleons, the saccadic response could contribute to gaze stabilization and add to the vestibulo-ocular and the optokinetic responses.

TI  - Persisting corneal oedema following intracapsular cataract extraction.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to reveal the frequency of persisting corneal oedema following intracapsular cataract extraction and at the same time to examine whether the survival rate after penetrating keratoplasty due to this diagnosis differs from the survival rate following penetrating keratoplasty due to primary Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A series of 2455 eyes underwent intracapsular cataract extraction between January 1, 1986 and December 31, 1988, at the Department of Ophthalmology, Arhus University Hospital. The medical files were examined to study the frequency of persisting corneal oedema. Patients with persisting corneal oedema were offered penetrating keratoplasty and the survival rate following this procedure was calculated. RESULTS: The frequency of pseudophakic persisting corneal oedema was 5.3% in the group of patients who underwent intracapsular cataract extraction. The survival of the following corneal transplantation was 54% after 2 years of follow-up. This is a low survival rate compared to the survival rate in primary Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, but there is a similarity to this disease in a development of a slowly progressive oedema in 17% compared to 13% in primary Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. CONCLUSION: 5.3% of a group of patients who underwent intracapsular cataract extraction developed persisting corneal oedema within a 5 to 7-year follow-up period. When these patients underwent penetrating keratoplasty the survival rate of the graft was 54% after 2 years of follow-up.

TI  - Recent trends in the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism in Japan: opinion survey results, especially on the combination therapy of antithyroid drug and thyroid hormone.  
AB  - An opinion survey concerning the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism was conducted among the council members of the Japan Thyroid Association. The selection of 3 major treatments by 90 respondents for their patients was 98.6 +/- 4.2% for antithyroid drug (ATD), 7.8 +/- 12.6% for partial thyroidectomy and 5.2 +/- 8.1% for radioiodide. They expressed a movement away from the past trend of surgery because of postoperative complications and unsatisfactory therapeutic results, and they assumed a further reduction in the future. On the other hand, the frequency of radioiodide treatment was not considered to have decreased greatly, and they expected a slight increase in the future. Of the respondents, 65% suggested that hyperthyroidism should be completely cured even if the patient would fall into hypothyroidism. The major reasons for choosing surgery or radioiodide after ATD were the adverse effects of ATD and the age and social backgrounds of the patients. Large goiter size was the 3rd reason for surgery but was a minimal indicator for radioiodide. As for ATD treatment, none of the respondents reported the routine application of any uniform fixed-time therapy protocol. Japanese Graves' patients were shown to be less responsive to ATD than Caucasian patients. This was assumed to result at least from high iodide intake, and half of them had ordered their patients to restrict iodide intake. Furthermore, 78% of them had treated with a combined therapy of ATD and thyroid hormone. Most of them apply this for selected patients mainly to lower TSH receptor antibody activity, to better control their patients and to reduce the goiter size. All but 8 (9%) did not give T4 (or T3) after the cessation of ATD, and they felt this to be unnecessary, doubtful about the effect, unsuitable or even possible to induce recurrence. The excellent findings reported by Hashizume et al. (N Engl J Med 324: 947-953, 1991) are well known among them. However, most of them did not agree with the efficacy of the protocol to reduce TRAb or to improve the remission rate, and 90% of the respondents did not intend to apply the protocol immediately. In conclusion, the Japanese thyroidologists were shown to highly prefer ATD, and they intended to treat their patients for longer periods of time only by ATD until clinical remission is achieved. The combination therapy is widely used, but most of them do not consider it effective. The therapeutic protocol reported by Hashizume et al. was not accepted widely in Japan.

TI  - Two-stage exposure of Syrian-hamster-embryo cells to environmental carcinogens: superinduction of ornithine decarboxylase correlates with increase of morphological-transformation frequency.  
AB  - As part of environmental toxicology, it is important to assess both the carcinogenic potential of xenobiotics and their mode of action on target cells. Since dysregulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, is considered as an early and essential component in the process of multistage carcinogenesis, we have studied the mode of ODC induction in Syrian-hamster-embryo(SHE) cells stage-exposed to carcinogens and to non-carcinogens. One-stage (5 hr) treatment of SHE cells with 50 microM clofibrate (CLF), a non-genotoxic carcinogen, or with 0.4 microM benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a genotoxic carcinogen, slightly decreased basal ODC activity. Using the 2-stage exposure, 1 hr to carcinogen, then replacement by TPA for 5 hr, the ODC activity was higher than that obtained with TPA alone. This ODC superinduction was not observed when SHE cells were similarly pre-treated with non-carcinogenic compounds. Several environmental chemicals, pesticides, solvents, oxidizers and drugs were investigated with this SHE cell model. With one-stage exposure, some xenobiotics decreased basal ODC activity, while for others ODC changes were not noticeable. With 2-stage exposure (chemical followed by TPA), all carcinogens amplified the TPA-inducing effect, resulting in ODC superinduction. Comparative studies of the action of carcinogens and of non-carcinogens, using 2-stage exposure protocols, clearly show a close relationship between ODC induction rate and morphological transformation frequency.

TI  - Subthreshold membrane resonance in neocortical neurons.  
AB  - 1. Using whole cell recording techniques, we studied subthreshold and suprathreshold voltage responses to oscillatory current inputs in neurons from the sensorimotor cortex of juvenile rats. 2. Based on firing patterns, neurons were classified as regular spiking (RS), intrinsic bursting (IB), and fast spiking (FS). The subthreshold voltage-current relationships of RS and IB neurons were rectifying whereas FS neurons were almost ohmic near rest. 3. Frequency response curves (FRCs) for neurons were determined by analyzing the frequency content of inputs and outputs. The FRCs of most neurons were voltage dependent at frequencies below, but not above, 20 Hz. Approximately 60% of RS and IB neurons had a membrane resonance at their resting potential. Resonant frequencies were between 0.7 and 2.5 Hz (24-26 degrees C) near -70 mV and usually increased with hyperpolarization and decreased with depolarization. The remaining RS and IB neurons and all FS neurons were nonresonant. 4. Resonant neurons near rest had a selective coupling between oscillatory inputs and firing. These neurons selectively fired action potentials when the frequency of the swept-sine-wave (ZAP) current input was near the resonant frequency. However, when these neurons were depolarized to -60 mV, spike firing was associated with many input frequencies rather than selectively near the resonant frequency. 5. We examined three subthreshold currents that could cause low-frequency resonance: IH, a slow, hyperpolarization-activated cation current that was blocked by external Cs+ but not Ba2+; IIR, an instantaneously activating, inwardly rectifying K+ current that was blocked by both Cs+ and Ba2+; and INaP, an quickly activating, inwardly rectifying persistent Na+ current that was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Voltage-clamp experiments defined the relative steady state activation ranges of these currents. IIR (activates below -80 mV) and INaP (activates above -65 mV) are unlikely to interact with each other because their activation ranges never overlap. However, both currents may interact with IH, which activated variably at potentials between -50 and -90 mV in different neurons. 6. We found that IH produces subthreshold response. Consistent with this, subthreshold resonance was blocked by external Cs+ but not Ba2+ or TTX. Application of Ba2+ enlarged FRCs and resonance at potentials below -80 mV, indicating that IK,ir normally attenuates resonance. Application of TTX greatly diminished resonance at potentials more depolarized than -65 mV, indicating that INaP normally amplifies resonance at these potentials. 7. The ZAP current input may be viewed as a model of oscillatory currents that arise in neocortical neurons during synchronized activity in the brain. We propose that the frequency selectivity endowed on neurons by IH may contribute to their participation in synchronized firing. The voltage dependence of the frequency-selective coupling between oscillatory inputs and spikes may indicate a novel mechanism for controlling the extent of low-frequency synchronized activity in the neocortex.

TI  - Spectral envelope and context effects in the tritone paradox.  
AB  - In previous studies of the 'tritone paradox' Deutsch has suggested that, when listeners are presented with pairs of octave-complex tones that are equal in average log frequency but differ in chroma by 6 semitones (a tritone), they perceive the direction of the chroma difference according to an individual pitch-class template. However, it has also been found that the perceived direction changes for many listeners when the spectral envelope of the tones is shifted along the frequency axis. Reanalysis of these data indicates a strong tendency to perceive the pitch class corresponding to the frequency on which the spectral envelope is centered as subjectively lowest. In experiment 1 this spectral-envelope effect was replicated with tone pairs presented in isolation, at the rate of one a day, which rules out artifacts of test format. In experiment 2, involving another context-free format, envelope center frequency was varied over a wide range and it was shown that some individuals are totally envelope dependent, whereas others rely more on pitch class, and yet others show mixed patterns. Experiment 3 demonstrated that listeners' judgments of tritone pairs can be swayed easily by preceding context. Finally, experiment 4 showed that strong envelope effects are also obtained with Deutsch's own tritone test (issued on CD). The subjective relative pitch height of octave-complex tones thus depends on several competing factors, only one of which is pitch class.

The effect of incubation with the nitric oxide (NO) donor nitroglycerin and of long-term electrical stimulation on relaxations induced by non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve stimulation, exogenous NO, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and lemakalim was investigated in the pig gastric fundus. 2. In physiological salt solution containing 10(-6) M atropine and 4 x 10(-6) M guanethidine, electrical field stimulation (40 V, 0.1 ms, 0.5-8 Hz) for periods of 10 s at 5 min intervals (train stimulation) and administration of NO (2 x 10(-6)-10(-4) M) at 5 min intervals (NO boli) induced frequency- and concentration-dependent transient relaxations, respectively. Continuous electrical field stimulation with stepwise increase of the frequency (0.5-8 Hz, cumulative stimulation) induced frequency-dependent sustained relaxations. VIP (10(-7) M), lemakalim (10(-5) M) and an infusion of NO induced a sustained relaxation. 3. Pretreatment for 30 min with 5 x 10(-4) M nitroglycerin reduced the relaxations induced by train and cumulative stimulation, but also the relaxant responses to NO, both when given in boli or as an infusion. The relaxations to VIP and lemakalim were not influenced by pretreatment with nitroglycerin. 4. Long-term electrical stimulation at 4 Hz for 40 min induced a sustained relaxation of the tissues. Administration of 3 x 10(-4) M N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester after 10, 20 or 30 min reversed the relaxation to a similar extent (approximately 70%). Previous long-term electrical stimulation at 4 Hz for 30 min did not affect the responses to stimulation, NO and VIP. 5. These results illustrate that nitroglycerin can induce a postjunctional tolerance to nitrergic stimuli in the pig gastric fundus but evidence for a prejunctional inhibition of neuronal NO synthase by NO was not obtained.

TI  - Genetic variability and linkage disequilibrium within the DP region in the CEPH families.  
AB  - A PCR-based SSO-assay has been developed to characterize the allelic polymorphism at the HLA-DPA1 locus. To validate the performance of this assay, 77 samples were typed side by side in a blinded fashion by the SSO assay and sequencing-based typing (SBT); 100% concordance was seen between the two methods. To address questions of genetic variability and linkage disequilibrium within the class II region, 478 members of the 37 original Caucasian Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families were typed for DPA1 using the SSO assay providing information on 247 independent chromosomes. Six of the eight known DPA1 alleles were detected in this population; DPA1*0103 was the most frequent allele. Analysis of the distribution of allele and haplotype frequencies using the homozygosity statistic suggests that balancing selection does not appear to be acting on the DPA1 locus nor on the functional DP heterodimer in this population. Family data permits the unambiguous assignment of haplotypes. Of the 247 independent chromosomes analyzed, 24 distinct DPA1-DPB1 haplotypes were identified with DPA1*0103-DPB1*0401 being the most common. Twelve of the 18 DPB1 alleles identified in this population have an exclusive association with one DPA1 allele. Of the remaining six DPB1 alleles, four are present at a frequency of >3% and show preferential association with just one DPA1 allele. Calculation of the normalized disequilibrium parameter (D') shows 13 DP haplotypes to be in significant positive disequilibrium. These data suggest there is strong linkage disequilibrium between the DPA1 and DPB1 loci in this Caucasoid population and provide a basis with which to study linkage disequilibrium in other ethnic groups as well as analyze the evolutionary forces which govern allelic and haplotypic variation.

TI  - Molecular modeling of immunoglobulin light chains implicates hydrophobic residues in non-amyloid light chain deposition disease.  
AB  - Light chain deposition disease is a severe complication of certain immunoproliferative disorders, due to the secretion of a monoclonal light chain which precipitates close to basement membranes of several tissues. A kappa isotype restriction and an unusual frequency of a variable region subgroup (VkappaIV) suggest that precise structural features govern the propensity of pathogenic light chains to precipitate in extracellular spaces. We studied primary structures of light chains from six patients with light chain deposition disease in comparison with light chains from other pathological conditions. Sequence alignment revealed the presence of certain amino acids only in light chain deposition disease, in particular non-polar replacing hydrophilic residues. To determine the role of these residues, structures of the variable domain from four kappa chains belonging to VkappaI and VkappaIV subgroups responsible for deposition disease were modeled using known immunoglobulins as templates. The most evident structural features shared by all pathogenic light chains were hydrophobic residues exposed to the solvent in complementarity determining regions 1 or 3. In contrast to immunoglobulin light chain-related amyloidosis, where deposition of organized material might be due to electrostatic interactions between light chain dimers, hydrophobic interactions could enhance amorphous precipitation in non-amyloid light chain deposition disease.

We studied glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) and islet cell antibodies (ICA) in patients with FCPD and compared the results with Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus, Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic subjects in Southern India. The prevalence of GAD-Ab was 7.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.9-17.2) in FCPD, 47.5% (CI 31.4-64.0) in Type 1 (p < 0.001 compared to FCPD), 5.6% (CI 1.5-13.9) in Type 2 (non-significant (NS) compared to FCPD) and 0% in controls. The prevalence of ICA was 6.3% (CI 1.2-17.4) in FCPD, 53.8% (CI 37.1-70.0) in Type 1 (p < 0.001 compared to FCPD), 9.9% (CI 4.0-19.4) in Type 2 (NS compared to FCPD) and 4.7% (CI 0.4-16.1) in controls. The data suggest that in FCPD, the frequency of auto-antibodies is low and its aetiology is probably not linked to autoimmunity in the majority of the patients.

TI  - Impact of marital quality and parent-infant interaction on preschool behavior problems.  
AB  - This study examined the relationships between parent interactions with healthy term and preterm infants at 12 months of age, marital quality, family socioeconomic status, and preschool behavior problems. Eighty mothers and 74 fathers were observed in the home during an interaction with their child (Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale), and this group of parents completed the Dyadic Adjustment Scale questionnaire (marital quality) 12 months after the child was discharged from the hospital. Each parent completed the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory when their child was four years of age. The parent and infant interaction scores were not predictive of later child behavior problems. Maternal perceptions of marital quality at 12 months predicted the frequency (Eyberg Intensity score) and impact (Eyberg Problem score) of the child's problematic behaviors reported by mothers. Marital quality and family socioeconomic status predicted the impact of behavior problems for fathers. There were no significant differences between preterm and term children or between boys and girls in the frequency or impact of problematic behaviors. Mothers reported a significantly greater frequency of behavior problems than fathers of the same children. The implications of these findings for nurses who work with families and young children are discussed.

TI  - Assessment of distributed arterial network models.  
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of elastic non-linearities, viscoelasticity and resistance vessel modelling on arterial pressure and flow wave contours computed with distributed arterial network models. The computational results of a non-linear (time-domain) and a linear (frequency-domain) mode were compared using the same geometrical configuration and identical upstream and downstream boundary conditions and mechanical properties. pressures were computed at the ascending aorta, brachial and femoral artery. In spite of the identical problem definition, computational differences were found in input impedance modulus (max. 15-20%), systolic pressure (max. 5%) and pulse pressure (max. 10%). For the brachial artery, the ratio of pulse pressure to aortic pulse pressure was practically identical for both models (3%), whereas for the femoral artery higher values are found for the linear model (+10%). The aortic/brachial pressure transfer function indicates that pressure harmonic amplification is somewhat higher in the linear model for frequencies lower than 6 Hz while the opposite is true for higher frequencies. These computational disparities were attributed to conceptual model differences, such as the treatment of geometric tapering, rather than to elastic or convective non-linearities. Compared to the effect of viscoelasticity, the discrepancy between the linear and non-linear model is of the same importance. At peripheral locations, the correct representation of terminal impedance outweight the computational differences between the linear and non-linear models.

TI  - Association of coffee, green tea, and caffeine intakes with serum concentrations of estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin in premenopausal Japanese women.  
AB  - Caffeine intake has been proposed to influence breast cancer risk. Its effect may be mediated by hormonal changes. The relationships between caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, green tea, black tea, oolong tea, and cola) and serum concentrations of estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin were evaluated in 50 premenopausal Japanese women. Intakes of caffeine and caffeine-containing beverages were assessed by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained from each woman on Days 11 and 22 of her menstrual cycle. High intakes of caffeinated coffee, green tea, and total caffeine were commonly correlated with increasing sex hormone-binding globulin on Days 11 and 22 of the cycle after controlling for potential confounders [Spearman correlation coefficients (r) ranged from 0.23 to 0.31]. Green tea but not caffeinated coffee intake was inversely correlated with estradiol on Day 11 of the cycle (r = -0.32, p = 0.04). Although the effect of caffeine cannot be distinguished from effects of coffee and green tea, consumption of caffeine-containing beverages appeared to favorably alter hormone levels associated with the risk of developing breast cancer.

TI  - Schizophrenia among patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis and appendicitis.  
AB  - The widely accepted negative association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is based on the results of investigations which sought RA in large samples of schizophrenic patients. Using a discharge register, we examined the frequency of schizophrenia in a sample of 5626 RA patients. Appendicitis patients (n = 5330) were used as a comparison group. The cumulative incidence of hospital care with the diagnosis of schizophrenia during 8 years was higher in the RA group (0.64%) than in the appendicitis group (0.47%). Schizophrenia was significantly more common in the RA group than in the appendicitis group among the young. The age-adjusted prevalence of schizophrenia was 0.96% in the RA group and 0.51% in the appendicitis group. Because of this unexpected finding, we examined the incidence of RA and appendicitis among a birth cohort born in 1966. The frequencies of RA and appendicitis among schizophrenic cohort members (n = 76), cohort members with psychiatric diagnosis other than schizophrenia (n = 438), and members without psychiatric diagnosis (n = 10503) were similar. These findings do not support the negative association between schizophrenia and RA. Prolonged institutionalization per se may have been the protective factor against RA in the previous studies. The findings also raise the hypothesis that genes that predispose to schizophrenia provide protection from appendicitis, historically a common cause of mortality.

This hydrogen bond, apparently between the N1-H of the inhibitor and the Odelta1 of Glu217 in ADA, causes a substantial N1-H bending frequency increase of about 50-100 cm-1 compared to its solution value, and this results in an estimated enthalpy of the hydrogen bond of 4-10 kcal/mol.

TI  - Characterization of hydrogen bonding in the complex of adenosine deaminase with a transition state analogue: a Raman spectroscopic study.  
AB  - The Raman spectra of purine ribonucleoside as well as a stable model compound (1-methoxyl-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside), free in solution and bound into its complex with adenosine deaminase (ADA), have been studied by Raman difference spectroscopy. Using purine riboside analogues labeled with 15N1 or 13C6 and the theoretical frequency normal-mode analyses of these molecules using ab initio quantum mechanic methods, we have positively identified many of the Raman bands in the enzyme-bound inhibitor. The spectrum of the enzyme-bound inhibitor is consistent with the enzyme-catalyzed hydration of the purine base to yield 1-hydroxyl-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside, as suggested earlier by X-ray crystallographic studies. In addition, the Raman data and subsequent vibrational analyses show that the binding-induced Raman spectral changes of the inhibitor can be modeled by the formation of a strong hydrogen bond to its N1-H bond. This hydrogen bond, apparently between the N1-H of the inhibitor and the Odelta1 of Glu217 in ADA, causes a substantial N1-H bending frequency increase of about 50-100 cm-1 compared to its solution value, and this results in an estimated enthalpy of the hydrogen bond of 4-10 kcal/mol. The relationship of transition state stabilization in the catalytic strategy of this efficient enzyme to such a bonding pattern is discussed.

TI  - Effect of prophylactic administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) on the frequency of nosocomial infections in patients with acute traumatic brain injury or cerebral hemorrhage. The Filgrastim Study Group [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of prophylactic recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) reduces the frequency of nosocomial infections in patients with either acute traumatic brain injury or cerebral hemorrhage. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase II study. SETTING: Intensive care units of seven medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients with either acute traumatic brain injury or cerebral hemorrhage who were intubated within 6 hrs of admission and who were expected to be ventilated for >72 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (n = 21) or one of two doses of filgrastim (75 microg [n = 20] or 300 microg [n = 20]) for 10 days or until the absolute neutrophil count was >75,000 cells/mm3 or until extubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: End points included increase in absolute neutrophil count, safety of filgrastim, and frequency of nosocomial infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection). Filgrastim caused a dose-dependent increase in absolute neutrophil count. There were no differences in the frequency of pneumonia or urinary tract infection; however, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of bacteremias (p < .05). Adverse events were similar among the three groups. There was one case of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: In this patient population, use of filgrastim was safe and the agent appeared to reduce the risk of primary bacteremias but had no beneficial effects on mortality, length of stay, or other nosocomial infections.

TI  -  Frequency of motor neuron diseases in a Mexico City referral center.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence and clinical characteristics of MND (Motor Neuron Diseases) in a Mexican institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was a retrospective study, of 274 definitive MND patients seen in a neurological reference hospital of Mexico City during the period of 1965-1995 (248 as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 15 as Progressive Bulbar Palsy, 8 as Primary Lateral Sclerosis and 3 as Progressive Spinal Atrophy). RESULTS: The frequency of MND increased gradually in our institution in the 31 years revised. The mean age of onset in our series was approximately 48 years in contrast to a higher age found in other series. The clinical features are similar to those found elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the frequency of MND is increasing in Mexico in a similar fashion to that observed in the rest of the world. This makes conceivable that the incidence of MND in Mexico may also resemble the figures reported worldwide. Prospective population studies are required to establish the incidence of MND in Mexico.

TI  - Risk factors associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: limited frequency of an unidentified source of transmission [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Risk factors have been studied in patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis, and approximately 40-50% have no known risk factor for viral acquisition. A significant undefined source of viral transmission has been suggested. We sought to clearly delineate the risk factors in a population of patients with documented chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to assess the magnitude of HCV transmission without known risk factors. METHODS: Risk factor profiles were carefully assessed in 301 consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection. Patients were classified by gender and age. Overall risk factor distributions were calculated and comparisons were made between groups to detect differences in mode of HCV acquisition. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-six men and 105 women were studied; 223 were age < or = 45 yr and 78 were > 45 yr. Overall, 25% of patients had a history of transfusion and 49% had a history of intravenous drug use (i.v.DU). Only 12% had no history of risk factor exposure. Men were more likely to have a history of i.v.DU and less likely to have a history of blood transfusion or sexual exposure/household contact. Younger patients were more likely to have a history of i.v.DU and older patients were more likely to have a history of blood transfusion and to deny all risk factor exposure. CONCLUSIONS: A careful history delineated a potential risk factor for HCV acquisition in 88% of patients with chronic HCV infection. Men and younger patients had different risk factor profiles than women and older patients, respectively. It is likely that an important unknown mode of HCV transmission occurs in a significant minority of patients.

On discontinuing levodopa a concomitant reduction in off period time was also seen (35% of waking day "off" reduced to 10%) CONCLUSION: Continuous waking day dopaminergic stimulation with apomorphine reset the threshold for dyskinesias and led to a pronounced reduction in their frequency. Apomorphine should be considered as a less invasive alternative to pallidotomy or deep cerebral stimulation in controlling levodopa induced interdose dose dyskinesias.

TI  - Clonal overexpression of metallothionein is induced by somatic mutation in morphologically normal colonic mucosa.  
AB  - Metallothionein (MT) overexpression occurs frequently in human tumours but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Morphologically normal-appearing mucosa from human colorectal carcinoma resection specimens and of the colons of ageing laboratory mice contains scattered single crypts whose cells show uniformly increased MT immunostaining, suggesting that MT overexpression arises directly from random crypt stem cell somatic mutation, followed by colonization of the clonal unit by the mutated progeny. This hypothesis has now been tested by quantifying the frequency of immunocytochemically detectable monocryptal colorectal MT overexpression, 5 and 30 days after injection of 8-week-old mice with a single dose of the mutagen dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 30 mg/kg subcutaneous). Otherwise normal-appearing MT-positive crypts were recorded as either wholly or partially involved by the overexpressing phenotype. Five days after DMH injection, the median frequency of partially involved MT-positive crypts was 11.7 x 10(-4), declining significantly to 1.8 x 10(-4) at 30 days (Mann-Whitney U, P < 0.01). In contrast, the median frequency of wholly involved crypts was 0.2 x 10(-4) at 5 days, increasing significantly (P < 0.005) to 12.9 x 10(-4) at 30 days.  The frequency of MT-positive crypts and the time course of evolution of partially involved to wholly involved forms were similar to those described for mutation-induced crypt-restricted loss of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in mice treated with an identical DMH regimen. The findings indicate that cellular MT overexpression can occur as a direct consequence of somatic mutation, either cis-activating mutation(s) of the MT gene itself, or trans-activating mutation(s) of other genes involved in controlling MT expression. This is likely to be an important mechanism underlying MT overexpression in neoplasia. Such mutation-induced aberrant MT expression may be involved in the acquisition of selective cellular growth of survival advantage during tumour progression.

TI  - A comparative study using two dose regimens (200 microg or 400 microg) of vaginal misoprostol for pre-operative cervical dilatation in first trimester nulliparae.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal dosage and dosing interval for the use of misoprostol administered vaginally for pre-operative cervical dilatation. DESIGN: Prospective double-blind randomised study. SETTING: Fertility Control Centre, National University Hospital, Singapore. METHODS: Women were randomly allocated to either the 200 microg or the 400 microg misoprostol group. Vacuum aspiration was performed at either three or four hours after the insertion of misoprostol tablets. Using Hegar's dilatator, degree of cervical dilatation before operation was measured. Other parameters assessed included the amount of additional dilatation required (if it was < Hegar 8), pre-operative and intra-operative blood loss, and associated side effects. RESULTS: For the 200 microg misoprostol group, only seven (23.3%) achieved a dilatation of > or = 8 mm compared with 29 women (96.7%) in the 400 microg misoprostol group. The odds ratio was 95.3 (95% CI 10.9-830.9) for 400 microg misoprostol for successful pre-operative cervical dilatation of > or = 8 mm. The mean cervical dilatation for 400 microg and 200 microg misoprostol was 8.2 mm and 6.4 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). The use of 400 microg misoprostol with an evacuation interval of three hours appears to be the optimal dosage and evacuation time interval. Increasing the time interval beyond three hours did not confer any additional advantage on the rate of successful cervical dilatation but was instead associated with an increase in side effects such as vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain and the appearance of products of conception at the cervical os. However, besides vaginal bleeding, no significant differences in the frequency of these side effects were demonstrated. CONCLUSION: This first report on the comparison of differing dosages and time intervals to determine the optimal dosage treatment schedule shows that the vaginal application of 400 microg misoprostol for at least three hours is optimal for pre-operative cervical dilatation before vacuum aspiration in first trimester nulliparae.

TI  - Esophageal stethoscope placement depth: its effect on heart and lung sound monitoring during general anesthesia.  
AB  - Although the esophageal stethoscope has been used for many years, the effect of the depth of placement on the quality of the sounds obtained has never been investigated. The amplitude and frequency characteristics of the first and second heart sound and of inspiratory and expiratory breath sounds were determined at various stethoscope depths (from the distal tip) in 17 healthy anesthetized adults. The amplitude for each type of sound varied markedly with depth. Maximal amplitude for S1 was at 34 +/- 3 cm, for S2 at 27 +/- 2 cm, for inspiratory breath sound at 28 +/- 2 cm, and for expiratory breath sound at 26 +/- 2 cm. There was a positive linear correlation between the depth of maximal amplitude of these sounds and patient height. Peak frequency, in general, did not change with depth. We conclude that investigators should measure and document depth when performing studies involving the esophageal stethoscope. Implications: Analysis of sound from the esophageal stethoscope at various depths reveals that placement depth greatly affects the sounds. A depth of 28-32 cm is recommended for clinical use; S1, S2, and inspiratory and expiratory sounds have a high amplitude in that range.

TI  - Modeling interaural-delay sensitivity to frequency modulation at high frequencies.  
AB  - Interaural-delay sensitivity to high-frequency (> or = 3 kHz) sinusoidal-frequency-modulated (SFM) tones is examined for rates from 25 to 800 Hz and depths of -12 to 18 dB. Comparison is made to thresholds obtained for sinusoidal-amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones for the same observers and modulation rates. Both SAM and SFM threshold-by-rate functions are U-shaped with optimum sensitivity to SFM tones occurring at higher rates (fm = 200-400 Hz) compared to those for SAM tones (fm = 100-200 Hz). Effects of modulation depth were examined for rates from 50 to 300 Hz. In all cases thresholds improved considerably with increasing modulation depth. It is also shown that a hybrid dichotic signal composed of an SFM tone presented to one ear and an SAM tone to the other, can perceptually fuse and be lateralized, with the contingency that both stimuli have equal modulation rates but not necessarily equal carrier frequencies. Using bandpass noise to restrict off-frequency listening, it was shown that for this stimulus, observers can use information from filters either below or above the carrier frequency. Consistent with FM-to-AM conversion from cochlear bandpass filtering, several important differences between the SAM- and SFM-tone data can be predicted from a nonstationary stochastic model of binaural interaction whose parameters are uniquely determined from the SAM-tone data.

TI  - In vitro investigation of toxaphene genotoxicity in S. typhimurium and Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts.  
AB  - The polychlorinated pesticide toxaphene has been identified as a persistent environmental contaminant and is of particular concern in the Great Lakes and Arctic regions of Canada. Inconsistencies in published in vitro genotoxicology studies have hindered risk assessments of toxaphene exposure. When toxaphene mutagenicity was re-evaluated in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 10-10,000 &mgr;g/plate, a dose-dependent increase in His revertants occurred in all five strains of S. typhimurium tested (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104) with higher mutation frequencies observed in the absence of S9 metabolic activation. However, the mutagenic potential of toxaphene was relatively low with concentrations greater than 500 microg/plate required to induce mutation. Toxaphene genotoxicity was also examined in a mammalian system using Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts with metabolic activation provided by human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Genotoxicity of 1-10 microg/ml toxaphene was examined by measuring the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and mutation induction at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) gene locus. Although small increases in SCE were observed at toxic concentrations of toxaphene approaching the LD50 (10 microg/ml), they were not found to be statistically significant relative to control. Toxaphene was also unable to induce HGPRT mutagenesis at the concentrations tested. These results show that while toxaphene is a weak, direct-acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella Test, convincing evidence of dose-dependent SCE induction and mutagenicity at the HGPRT gene locus could not be demonstrated in V79 cells.

In the current study, 78 male and 100 female undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 25 years (M = 21.2, SD = 1.9) from various majors completed a demographics/frequency of exercise survey, two body-assessment inventories, and the Reasons for Exercise Inventory of Silberstein, Striegel-Moore, Timko, and Rodin. Contrary to Cash, et al.'s findings, only health and fitness reasons were predictive of women's frequency of exercise, and women's dissatisfaction with specific bodily attributes was not significantly related to any reasons for exercising; however, like women in their sample, the current students who experienced more situational body dissatisfaction exercised for appearance and weight control. Sex comparisons indicated similar dissatisfaction with specific bodily attributes among men and women, but values were not significantly associated with any reasons for exercising. Women reported higher situational body dissatisfaction and exercising for appearance-related reasons more than men. Current participants may represent a more diverse group than previously tested, and the inventory's factor structure may not be generalizable to men and women.

TI  - Beneficial effect of a bile acid resin binder on enteral feeding induced diarrhea.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diarrhea is a complication of enteral feeding, occurring in up to 68% of critically ill patients. We hypothesized that prolonged fasting results in abnormal bile acid homeostasis. Subsequent enteral feeding then causes a relative luminal excess of bile acids, which leads to choleretic diarrhea. Hence, diarrhea induced by enteral feeding should improve with the use of a bile acid binding agent, such as Colestid Granules. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of Colestid on enteral feeding-induced diarrhea in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Nineteen patients who were nil per os (NPO) for 5 days before initiation of enteral feeding were enrolled in the study and treatment continued for 7 days. The severity and frequency of diarrhea were quantified. Fecal bile acids were measured enzymatically. Stool nutrient loss was measured by fat extraction, microkjeldahl determination of nitrogen, and bomb calorimetry of dried fecal specimens. RESULTS: Enteral feeding resulted in a high frequency of diarrhea (95%) at some time during the observation period. The majority of episodes of diarrhea in both groups were of low volume. Colestid significantly decreased the prevalence and severity of diarrhea. Colestid had no significant effect on fecal calorie or nutrient losses. The average bile acid concentration in the stool increased significantly after enteral feeding. CONCLUSION: Enteral feeding-induced diarrhea is, at least in part, due to malabsorption of bile acids. The bile acid resin binding agent Colestid improves diarrhea induced by enteral feeding.

TI  - Sequence context profoundly influences the mutagenic potency of trans-opened benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide-purine nucleoside adducts in site-specific mutation studies.  
AB  - The postoligomerization method was used to prepare oligonucleotide 16-mers that contained dAdo or dGuo adducts, derived from trans opening of each enantiomer of the two diastereomeric benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxides, in two sequence contexts. These 16 oligonucleotides, along with the four corresponding oligonucleotides containing unsubstituted purines, were ligated into single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp7L2 and transfected into Escherichia coli SMH77. The mutagenic effects of replication past these adducts were then evaluated. The various adduct isomers induced point mutations at different frequencies and with different distributions of mutation types, as was anticipated. However, sequence context had the most substantial effects on mutation frequency. A high frequency of deletions of a single guanine was found in a context where the dGuo adduct was at the 3'-end of a run of five guanines, whereas no single base deletion was found in the other context studied, 5'-CGA-3'. Mutation frequencies in constructs containing dAdo adducts were much higher in a 5'-TAG-3' context (37-58%, depending on the individual isomer) than in a 5'-GAT-3' context (5-20%), and for a given adduct, mutation frequency was up to 10-fold higher in the former sequence than in the latter. These findings indicate that sequence context effects need more thorough evaluation if the goal of understanding the mechanism through which DNA adducts lead to mutation is to be achieved.

AB  - Fas (APO-1/CD95)-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in liver cell destruction in viral hepatitis. Using sandwich ELISA, we measured serum levels of soluble Fas (sFas) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody. sFas levels were significantly higher in HCC patients (median 4.07 ng/ml; range 0.14-29.18 ng/ml) than levels in age-matched healthy donors (0.29 ng/ml; 0-4.90 ng/ ml) (P < 0.0001) and HBsAg or anti-HCV antibody-positive patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) (2.16 ng/ ml; 0.24-8.39 ng/ml) (P = 0.0015). An arbitrary cut-off level of 3.03 ng/ml (mean + 3 s.d. of controls) revealed the positive frequency of sFas in each group: 1.7% in healthy subjects, 25.9% in LC, and 59.0% in HCC (sensitivity 59.0% and specificity 74.1%). All HCC sera tested contained transmembrane-deleted sFas and some contained another sFas lacking the Fas C-terminal. The positive frequency of either sFas (59.0%) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (57.4%) in HCC patients reached 77.0%. HCC patients with multiple tumour foci (7.53 ng/ml; 1.40-29.18 ng/ml) had significantly higher sFas levels than did patients with a solitary tumour (2.70 ng/ml; 0.14-19.0 ng/ml) (P = 0.003). In all of the sFas-positive patients with a solitary tumour, surgical removal of the tumour reduced sFas levels to the negative in the first post-op week. These findings suggest that sFas may be closely linked with HCC and may be a candidate for a clinical parameter for HCC.

TI  - Functional specialization in auditory cortex: responses to frequency-modulated stimuli in the cat's posterior auditory field.  
AB  - The mammalian auditory cortex contains multiple fields but their functional role is poorly understood. Here we examine the responses of single neurons in the posterior auditory field (P) of barbiturate- and ketamine-anesthetized cats to frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. FM sweeps traversed the excitatory response area of the neuron under study, and FM direction and the linear rate of change of frequency (RCF) were varied systematically. In some neurons, sweeps of different sound pressure levels (SPLs) also were tested. The response magnitude (number of spikes corrected for spontaneous activity) of nearly all field P neurons varied with RCF. RCF response functions displayed a variety of shapes, but most functions were of low-pass characteristic or peaked at rather low RCFs (<100 kHz/s). Neurons with strong responses to high RCFs (high-pass or nonselective RCF response function characteristics) all displayed spike count-SPL functions to tone burst onsets that were monotonic or weakly nonmonotonic. RCF response functions and best RCFs often changed with SPL. For most neurons, FM directional sensitivity, quantified by a directional sensitivity (DS) index, also varied with RCF and SPL, but the mean and width of the distribution of DS indices across all neurons was independent of RCF. Analysis of response timing revealed that the phasic response of a neuron is triggered when the instantaneous frequency of the sweep reaches a particular value, the effective Fi. For a given neuron, values of effective Fi were independent of RCF, but depended on FM direction and SPL and were associated closely with the boundaries of the neuron's frequency versus amplitude response area. The standard deviation (SD) of the latency of the first spike of the response decreased with RCF. When SD was expressed relative to the rate of change of stimulus frequency, the resulting index of frequency jitter increased with RCF and did so rather uniformly in all neurons and largely independent of SPL. These properties suggest that many FM parameters are represented by, and may be encoded in, orderly temporal patterns across different neurons in addition to the strength of responses. When compared with neurons in primary and anterior auditory fields, field P neurons respond better to relatively slow FMs. Together with previous studies of responses to modulations of amplitude, such as tone onsets, our findings suggest more generally that field P may be best suited for processing signals that vary relatively slowly over time.

TI  - Sudden changes in spectrum of an echo cause a breakdown of the precedence effect.  
AB  - The effect of changing the frequency components of an echo relative to the sound source was examined in a two-choice discrimination task. Subjects sat in an anechoic chamber and discriminated the direction of the lag noise burst within a lead-lag pair presented over loudspeakers. The leading noise burst was broadband, and the lagging burst was either high- or low-pass filtered. On some conditions, this test burst pair was preceded by a conditioning train of burst pairs, which also had a broadband lead and either a high- or low-frequency lag. When the frequency content of the echo was held constant across the conditioning train and test burst pair, echo suppression that was built up during the repeating train was maintained for the test burst pair, shown by the subjects' poor performance in detecting the location of the lagging burst. By comparison, subjects had little difficulty in localizing the lagging burst when the frequency content of the echo changed between the conditioning train and the test burst, indicating that any buildup of suppression during the train was broken when the lagging burst's spectrum shifted. The data are consistent with an interpretation in which echo suppression is temporarily broken when listeners' built-up expectations about room acoustics are violated.

TI  - Dietary intake of antioxidant (pro)-vitamins, respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function: the MORGEN study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to investigate the relationships between the intake of the antioxidant (pro)-vitamins C, E and beta-carotene and the presence of respiratory symptoms and lung function. METHODS: Complete data were collected in a cross sectional study in a random sample of the Dutch population on 6555 adults during 1994 and 1995. Antioxidant intake was assessed by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, productive cough, wheeze, shortness of breath) were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Prevalence odds ratios for symptoms were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Linear regression analysis was used for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The results are presented as a comparison between the 90th and 10th percentiles of antioxidant intake. RESULTS: Vitamin C intake was not associated with most symptoms but was inversely related with cough. Subjects with a high intake of vitamin C had a 53 ml (95% CI 23 to 83) higher FEV1 and 79 ml (95% CI 42 to 116) higher FVC than those with a low vitamin C intake. Vitamin E intake showed no association with most symptoms and lung function, but had a positive association with productive cough. The intake of beta-carotene was not associated with most symptoms but had a positive association with wheeze. However, subjects with a high intake of beta-carotene had a 60 ml (95% CI 31 to 89) higher FEV1 and 75 ml (95% CI 40 to 110) higher FVC than those with a low intake of beta-carotene. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a high intake of vitamin C or beta-carotene is protective for FEV1 and FVC compared with a low intake, but not for respiratory symptoms.

TI  - The effect of preoperative dexamethasone on the immediate and delayed postoperative morbidity in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.  
AB  - In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effect of preoperative dexamethasone on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and 24-h recovery in children undergoing tonsillectomy. One hundred thirty children, 2-12 yr of age, ASA physical status I or II, completed the study. All children received oral midazolam 0.5-0.6 mg/kg preoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with halothane and nitrous oxide in 60% oxygen and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. Intubation was facilitated by mivacurium 0.2 mg/kg. Each child received fentanyl 1 microgram/kg i.v. before initiation of surgery, as well as dexamethasone 1 mg/kg (maximal dose 25 mg) (steroid group) or an equal volume of saline (control group). Intraoperative fluids were standardized to 25-30 mL/kg lactated Ringer's solution. All tonsillectomies were performed under the supervision of one attending surgeon using an electrodissection technique. Postoperatively, fentanyl and acetaminophen with codeine elixir were administered as needed for pain. Rescue antiemetics were administered when a child experienced two episodes of retching and/or vomiting. Before home discharge, the incidence of PONV, need for rescue antiemetics, quality or oral intake, and analgesic requirements did not differ between groups. However, during the 24 h after discharge, more patients in the control group experienced PONV (62% vs 24% in the steroid group) and complained of poor oral intake. Additionally, more children in the control group (8% vs 0% in the steroid group) returned to the hospital for the management of PONV and/or poor oral intake. The preoperative administration of dexamethasone significantly decreased the incidence of PONV over the 24 h after home discharge in these children. Implications: In this double blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the efficacy of a single large dose (1 mg/kg; maximal dose 25 mg) of preoperative dexamethasone on posttonsillectomy postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in children 2-12 yr of age undergoing tonsillectomy. Compared with placebo, dexamethasone significantly decreased the incidence of PONV in the 24 h after discharge, improved oral intake, decreased the frequency of parental phone calls, and resulted in no hospital returns for the management of PONV and/or poor oral intake.

TI  - A simple and rapid microSepharose assay for GAD65 and ICA512 autoantibodies in diabetes. Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS).  
AB  - GAD65Ab and ICA512Ab are strongly associated with insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus. A novel, simple radio-antigen binding assay with microSepharose conjugated with monoclonal antibodies specific for human immunoglobulin light chains was developed to provide diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of GAD65Ab and ICA512Ab for Type 1 diabetes. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the upper level of Normal in 583 new onset Type 1 diabetic patients and in 829 matched controls. The sensitivity of GAD65Ab and ICA512Ab was 66% (384/583) and 41% (211/520), respectively, and the diagnostic specificity was 96% for both autoantibodies. Levels, but not frequency, of GAD65Ab were higher among female Type 1 diabetes patients, whereas ICA512Ab levels did not differ between males and females. Positivity for GAD65Ab. ICA512Ab or both showed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 92% for Type 1 diabetes. This simple, one-step centrifugation, high-capacity radio-antigen binding assay has a high precision and reproducibility to accurately detect both GAD65Ab and ICA512Ab. This assay should also prove useful in other autoantibody assays against conformation-sensitive autoantigens.

TI  - Inhibition of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa with eptifibatide in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The PURSUIT Trial Investigators. Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregation of platelets is the pathophysiologic basis of the acute coronary syndromes. Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide, is a selective high-affinity inhibitor of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, which is involved in platelet aggregation. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of platelet aggregation with eptifibatide would have an incremental benefit beyond that of heparin and aspirin in reducing the frequency of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes who did not have persistent ST-segment elevation. METHODS: Patients who had presented with ischemic chest pain within the previous 24 hours and who had either electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia (but not persistent ST-segment elevation) or high serum concentrations of creatine kinase MB isoenzymes were enrolled in the study. They were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to receive a bolus and infusion of either eptifibatide or placebo, in addition to standard therapy, for up to 72 hours (or up to 96 hours, if coronary intervention was performed near the end of the 72-hour period). The primary end point was a composite of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction occurring up to 30 days after the index event. RESULTS: A total of 10,948 patients were enrolled between November 1995 and January 1997. As compared with the placebo group, the eptifibatide group had a 1.5 percent absolute reduction in the incidence of the primary end point (14.2 percent, vs. 15.7 percent in the placebo group; P=0.04). The benefit was apparent by 96 hours and persisted through 30 days. The effect was consistent in most major subgroups except for women (odds ratios for death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.8 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 0.9] in men, and 1.1 [0.9 to 1.31 in women). Bleeding was more common in the eptifibatide group, although there was no increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of platelet aggregation with eptifibatide reduced the incidence of the composite end point of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes who did not have persistent ST-segment elevation.

TI  - The effect of enteral fibre-containing feeds on stool parameters in the post-surgical period.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM OF STUDY: Specialised nutritional support includes both enteral and parenteral routes. When oral intake is not an option, but gastro-intestinal function is present, enteral tube feeding should be considered. However, one of the complications of enteral feeding access is diarrhoea. The aim of this study was to test the effect of fibre on a local population, in a prospective, single-blinded trial to determine whether the presence of fibre in enteral feeds reduced the incidence of diarrhoea in Asian patients. METHODS: Sixteen post-surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive a fibre-supplemented (FSF) enteral formula or a fibre-free formula (FFF) for 10 days post-surgery to assess the usefulness of FSF in reducing the incidence of diarrhoea in tube-fed patients. Differences in stool consistency, stool frequency, capillary blood glucose and serum albumin levels between the two groups were determined. Antibiotic usage in both groups was noted. RESULTS: Patients in the FSF group had more bowel movements throughout the 10-day period and firmer stools than the FFF group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.39). There were no significant differences in daily mean glucose levels between both groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is insufficient evidence that fibre-containing enteral formulae reduce the incidence of diarrhoea in tube-fed patients in the short term. However, these products could inherently be included for patients on tube-feeds during extended periods, with the prospect of maintaining gut function integrity and flora.

TI  - Stress during labor and delivery and early lactation performance.  
AB  - The amount of stress experienced by both the mother and fetus during labor and delivery varies considerably and is likely to be different in primiparous and multiparous women. In this study we explored relations between the birth experience and lactation performance of 40 women. Stress hormones were measured in serum or plasma during pregnancy, parturition (cord and maternal blood), and lactation. Milk samples were obtained and breast-feeding frequency was recorded each day during the first 2 wk postpartum. Four outcomes were used as markers of lactogenesis: the time when the subject first felt fullness in the breasts, 24-h milk volume on day 5 postpartum, milk lactose concentration on day 5, and the day of appearance of casein in the milk as determined by gel electrophoresis. There were significant intercorrelations among the outcome variables, except for milk lactose. Compared with multiparous women, primiparous mothers experienced a delay in breast fullness and lower milk volume on day 5. In multiple regression analyses excluding subjects who had cesarean deliveries (n = 5), markers of both fetal and maternal stress during labor and delivery (cord glucose concentration and maternal exhaustion score) were associated with delayed breast fullness and casein appearance; delayed casein appearance was also associated independently with a longer duration of labor. Milk volume on day 5 was lower in women with higher exhaustion scores, and, in multiparous women, those who breast-fed less frequently on day 2. The milk lactose concentration was inversely related to pregnancy weight gain. These results indicate that primiparity, long labor, stress to the mother and fetus during labor and delivery, and elevated cord glucose concentrations are risk factors for delayed lactogenesis.

TI  - Hydrogen bonding of redox-active tyrosine Z of photosystem II probed by FTIR difference spectroscopy.  
AB  - The TyrZ./TyrZ FTIR difference spectrum is reported for the first time in Mn-depleted photosystem II (PS II)-enriched membranes of spinach, in PS II core complexes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 WT, and in the mutant lacking TyrD (D2-Tyr160Phe). In Synechocystis, the v7'a(CO) and delta(COH) infrared modes of TyrZ are proposed to account at 1279 and 1255 cm-1.  The frequency of these modes indicate that TyrZ is protonated at pH 6 and involved in a strong hydrogen bond to the side chain of a histidine, probably D1-His190. A positive signal at 1512 cm-1 is assigned to the v(CO) mode of TyrZ. on the basis of the 27 cm-1 downshift observed upon 13C-Tyr labeling at the Tyr ring C4 carbon. A second IR signal, at 1532 cm-1, is tentatively assigned to the v8a(CC) mode of TyrZ.. The frequency of the v(CO) mode of TyrZ. at 1512 cm-1 is comparable to that observed at 1513 cm-1 for the Tyr. obtained by UV photochemistry of tyrosinate in solution, while it is higher than that of TyrD. in WT PS II at 1503 cm-1 and that of non-hydrogen-bonded TyrD. in the D2-His189Gln mutant at 1497 cm-1 [Hienerwadel, R., Boussac, A., Breton, J., Diner, B. A., and Berthomieu, C. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 14712-14723]. This latter work and the present FTIR study suggest that hydrogen bonding induces an upshift of the v(CO) IR mode of tyrosyl radicals and that TyrZ. forms (a) stronger hydrogen bond(s) than TyrD. in WT PS II. Alternatively, the frequency difference between TyrZ. and TyrD. v(CO) modes could be explained by a more localized positive charge near the tyrosyl radical oxygen of TyrD. than TyrZ.. The TyrZ./TyrZ spectrum obtained in Mn-depleted PS II membranes of spinach shows large similarities with the S3'/S2' spectrum characteristic of radical formation in Mn-containing but Ca(2+)-depleted PS II, in support of the assignment using ESEEM of TyrZ. as being responsible for the split EPR signal observed upon illumination in these conditions [Tang, X.-S., Randall, D. W., Force, D. A., Diner, B. A., and Britt, R. D. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 7638-7639]. The peak at 1514 cm-1 is assigned to the v(CO) mode of TyrZ. in these preparations, which indicates that Mn depletion only very slightly perturbs the immediate environment of TyrZ. phenoxyl.

TI  - [Effects of vertical banded gastroplasty on weight, quality of life and nutrition]  
AB  - We examined the long term results of vertical banded gastroplasty 3-10 years after operation. They were assessed by weight lost, incidence and severity of untoward effects and improvement in diet and in quality of life in 75 of 122 who had had the operation. Average weight lost was 28.5 +/- 14.9 kg (p < 0.001) in 5 years and 58.6 +/- 30.4% of excess weight, which brought patients to within 32 +/- 25.2% of ideal weight. According to these measures, in 63-76% the operation had been successful in causing weight loss. The 2 criteria for successful weight loss were loss of more than 50% of weight in excess of ideal body weight and residual body weight less than 50% greater than ideal body weight. There was a greater risk of failure in unmarried subjects older than 45 (odds ratio for not losing weight was 6; in those weighing more than 120 kg it was 9). We saw evidence of this mostly 4 years after operation (odds ratio 11). The degree of success in weight loss was correlated with texture of food (softness) preferred and length of operation. Of those interviewed, only 65% were satisfied with their results. The greatest improvement in quality of life measurements was in physical activity, perception of health, and frequency of feeling depressed. Side-effects were vomiting, reflux and fatigue. Only 34.7% were able to digest solid foods, so that subjects are at risk for nutritional deficiencies.

TI  - The tension-time index and the frequency/tidal volume ratio are the major pathophysiologic determinants of weaning failure and success.  
AB  - We have previously shown (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995;152:1248-1255) that in patients needing mechanical ventilation, the load imposed on the inspiratory muscles is excessive relative to their neuromuscular capacity. We have therefore hypothesized that weaning failure may occur because at the time of the trial of spontaneous breathing there is insufficient reduction of the inspiratory load. We therefore prospectively studied patients who initially had failed to wean from mechanical ventilation (F) but had successful weaning (S) on a later occasion. Compared with S, during F patients had greater intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (6. 10 +/- 2.45 versus 3.83 +/- 2.69 cm H2O), dynamic hyperinflation (327 +/- 180 versus 213 +/- 175 ml), total resistance (Rmax, 14.14 +/- 4.95 versus 11.19 +/- 4.01 cm H2O/L/s), ratio of mean to maximum inspiratory pressure (0.46 +/- 0.1 versus 0.31 +/- 0.08), tension time index (TTI, 0.162 +/- 0.032 versus 0.102 +/- 0.023) and power (315 +/- 153 versus 215 +/- 75 cm H2O x L/min), less maximum inspiratory pressure (42.3 +/- 12.7 versus 53.8 +/- 15.1 cm H2O), and a breathing pattern that was more rapid and shallow (ratio of frequency to tidal volume, f/VT 98 +/- 38 versus 62 +/- 21 breaths/min/L). To clarify on pathophysiologic grounds what determines inability to wean from mechanical ventilation, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with the weaning outcome as the dependent variable. The TTI and the f/VT ratio were the only significant variables in the model. We conclude that the TTI and the f/VT are the major pathophysiologic determinants underlying the transition from weaning failure to weaning success.

TI  - Coumarin chemoprotection against aflatoxin B1-induced gene mutation in a mammalian cell system: a species difference in mutagen activation and protection with chick embryo and rat liver S9.  
AB  - Coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone), a natural food constituent, prevents polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced neoplasms in rats and mice, but has not been studied with other chemical carcinogens. We examined coumarin chemoprotection against aflatoxin B1 using the 6-thioguanine resistance mutation assay in two different Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (K1BH4 and AS52) with liver S9 from rats and 19-day-old chick embryos for aflatoxin B1 bioactivation. Laboratory rodents metabolize coumarin through 3-hydroxylation, whereas 7-hydroxylation predominates in chick embryos and humans. Chick embryo liver S9 was approximately 25-fold more effective in activating aflatoxin B1 to the mutagenic and cytotoxic metabolite(s) than rat liver S9. Coumarin added at 50 and 500 microM with chick embryo liver S9 reduced the mutant frequency of 1 microM aflatoxin B1 by 40 and 85%, respectively. Coumarin up to 500 microM had no effect on aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity with rat liver S9. When liver S9 from chick embryos pretreated with coumarin was used for aflatoxin B1 bioactivation, mutant frequency and cytotoxicity were decreased compared to liver S9 from vehicle-treated controls. Liver S9 from coumarin-treated rats did not significantly affect mutant frequency or cytotoxicity. HPLC analysis of chick embryo liver S9 incubated with 1 microM aflatoxin B1 showed a dose-dependent decrease by coumarin of aflatoxin B1 activation to the 8,9-epoxide ranging from 70% of controls at 5 microM coumarin to 4% of controls at 500 microM coumarin. In contrast, coumarin produced a dose-dependent increase in 20 microM aflatoxin B1 activation by rat liver S9, reaching twice the control levels at 500 microM coumarin. These findings, using a mammalian cell system as a mutagenic endpoint, demonstrate marked species differences in chemoprotection by coumarin.

TI  - Reference values for glucose tolerance and glucose tolerance status in cats.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the reference range for glucose tolerance, using a simplified glucose tolerance test (GTT), and to evaluate glucose tolerance status in cats. DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 57 clinically normal cats. PROCEDURE: 2 catheters were placed in the cephalic veins of nonsedated cats at least 3 hours before the test. Blood samples were obtained before (0 minutes) and 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after glucose (0.5 g/kg [0.23 g/lb] of body weight) was injected i.v. Blood glucose concentration was measured by a glucose meter. Glucose half-life (t1/2) and disappearance of glucose (Kglucose) were calculated. RESULTS: Glucose tolerance in cats was considered normal when upper limits for glucose concentration were < or = 159 mg/dl at 0 minutes, < or = 322 mg/dl at 60 minutes, < or = 238 mg/dl at 90 minutes, or < or = 171 mg/dl at 120 minutes and glucose t1/2 was < or = 94.7 minutes or Kglucose was > or = 0.41%/min. Impaired glucose tolerance in cats was defined as a glucose concentration > or = 160 mg/dl at 0 minutes, > or = 323 mg/dl at 60 minutes, > or = 239 mg/dl at 90 minutes, or > or = 172 mg/dl at 120 minutes.  The frequency of impaired glucose tolerance was 2%. Five cats had stress-affected GTT. Significant differences in glucose t1/2 or Kglucose between cats < 7 and > or = 7 years old were not found. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The simplified GTT and measurement of glucose concentration by a glucose meter provides a simple and low-cost method of assessing glucose tolerance status in cats that are normoglycemic after food is withheld. Use of absolute glucose concentrations overcomes the need to calculate glucose t1/2 values. The high glucose concentration at 0 minutes found in this study may reflect a more realistic concentration to use in assessing client-owned cats in a hospital environment.

TI  - [The use of the FISH method for the cytogenetic examination of persons with a history of acute radiation sickness in connection with the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station]  
AB  - We have performed conventional cytogenetics with group karyotyping and FISH analysis on metaphase-arrested lymphocyte cultured from 13 adults of 23 to 50 years. Twelve Chernobyl accident liquidators of 1986 year recovered from acute radiation sickness of the first (3 persons), second (7 persons) and third (2 persons) degree of severity; and one unexposed (control) person. A cocktail containing a balanced mix of directly-labeled by Spectrum orange whole-chromosome probes for human chromosomes 1,2 and 4 were used. Under the conventional staining the positive correlation between the frequency of chromosome type aberration (acentrics, dicentrics, centric rings, abnormal monocentrics) and the severity of irradiation was established even 10 years after radiation exposure. Under the FISH analysis the frequency of reciprocal translocation was in the range from 0.061 to 0.729 per cell which corresponded to doses of acute uniform irradiation from 0.8 till 3.48 Gy. The data obtained confirmed the validity of FISH as for quantifying stable chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of irradiated persons as the high sensitivity of FISH for the retrospective dose evaluation in delayed terms after radiation exposure.

TI  - Stressful life events and personality styles: relation to impairment and treatment outcome in patients with social phobia.  
AB  - Forty-five patients with social phobia and 15 individuals with no mental disorder were compared on number and type of life events experienced. Social phobia patients were further examined to evaluate the effect of negative life events and of the interaction between personality style and life events on severity of impairment and reactions to cognitive-behavioral group therapy. Patients with social phobia reported more negative life events than participants with no mental disorder. Among patients with social phobia, more frequent negative life events were associated with higher scores on measures of depression and general anxiety. Patients high on autonomy who reported more negative autonomous (i.e., achievement-oriented) life events also scored higher on measures of social anxiety and general anxiety. There were no significant interactions between sociotropy and the frequency of reported socially oriented negative life events. However, patients high on sociotropy scored higher on measures of social anxiety, depression, and general anxiety. Patients who had experienced more negative life events improved more after treatment on measures of social anxiety than did those who had experienced fewer negative life events. Implications of these findings and recommendations for future research are discussed.

TI  - Right colonic diverticulitis: US and CT findings--new insights about frequency and natural history.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate how the use of ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) has changed insights on the frequency and natural history of right colonic diverticulitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical findings, US and CT images, and clinical and surgical records in 44 patients with a final diagnosis of right colonic diverticulitis seen over 11 years were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients, three underwent diverticulectomy, and 41 were successfully treated conservatively. Follow-up US demonstrated a consistent change in the pattern of the findings of diverticulitis over time, with eventual spontaneous evacuation of the contents of the inflamed diverticulum into the colonic lumen. Five patients had recurrent symptoms; two of them underwent elective surgery.  The frequency of right colonic diverticulitis was one in 34 appendectomies, which is nine times higher than that reported to date. CONCLUSION: Right colonic diverticulitis is more common than has been previously reported. US and CT findings are characteristic and show a consistent pattern of changes over time. The natural history is benign, and surgical intervention can be avoided in the vast majority of patients.

TI  - Applicability of combination with tirapazamine in boron neutron capture therapy.  
AB  - SCC VII tumor-bearing mice were continuously given 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label all proliferating cells. After injection of tirapazamine (TPZ), a bioreductive agent, combined with sodium borocaptate-10B (BSH) or dl-p-boronophenylalanine-10B (BPA) administration, the tumors were irradiated with thermal neutrons, and then isolated and incubated with cytochalasin-B (a cytokinesis blocker). The micronucleus (MN) frequency in cells without BrdU labeling (quiescent (Q) cells) was determined by means of immunofluorescence staining for BrdU, and that for total cells was obtained from tumors not pretreated with BrdU. Even when no 10B-compound was administered, TPZ increased the MN frequency of tumor cells including Q cells, resulting in reduction of the difference in MN frequency between total and Q cells, mainly by increasing the MN frequency of Q cells. TPZ increased the MN frequency of Q cells when combined with BPA administration, but TPZ showed no apparent effect on each cell population when combined with BSH. Namely, TPZ reduced the difference in MN frequency between total and Q cells caused by 10B-compound administration, especially when BPA was administered. From the viewpoint of the overall cell killing effect in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), combination with TPZ appeared to be useful in BPA-BNCT, but not in BSH-BNCT.

TI  - Chromatic and luminance interactions in spatial contrast signals.  
AB  - We report VEP studies which delineate interactions between chromatic and luminance contrast signals. We examined responses to sinusoidal luminance gratings undergoing 4-Hz square-wave contrast reversal, upon which standing gratings with various admixtures of luminance and chromatic contrast were alternately superimposed and withdrawn. The presence of the standing grating induced a VEP component at the fundamental frequency of the contrast-reversal grating. This VEP component appeared without any appreciable lag, and did not vary in amplitude over the 4 s during which the standing grating was present. The observed fundamental response differed from the fundamental component that would be expected from the known interaction between the luminance component of the standing grating with the modulated grating (Bodis-Wollner et al., 1972; Bobak et al., 1988), in three ways: (1) The fundamental response was not nulled for standing gratings that were isoluminant or near-isoluminant. (2) The chromatic dependence of the fundamental response implied an S-cone input to the interaction. (3) No single mechanism (driven by a linear combination of cone signals) could account quantitatively for the size of this response, particularly when the standing grating strongly modulated two cones in phase.

TI  - Normal median near nerve potential.  
AB  - In routine studies of sensory nerve conduction, only fibers > or = 7 microns in diameter are analyzed. The late components which originate from thinner fibers are not detected. This explains why a normal sensory action potential (SAP) may be recorded in patients with peripheral neuropathies and sensory loss. In the present study we investigated the late component of the median SAP with a near nerve needle electrode technique in 14 normal volunteers (7 men and 7 women), aged 34.5 +/- 14.8 years. The stimulus consisted of rectangular pulses of 0.2-ms duration at a frequency of 1 Hz with an intensity at least 6 times greater than the threshold value for the main component. Five hundred to 2000 sweep averagings were performed. The duration of analysis was 40 or 50 ms and the wave analysis frequency was 200 (-6 dB/oct) to 3000 Hz (-12 dB/oct). We used an apparatus with a two-channel amplifier system, 200 M omega or more of entry impedance and a noise level of 0.7 microVrms or less. The main component mean amplitude, conduction velocity and latency and the late component mean amplitude, conduction velocity and latency were respectively (mean +/- SD): 26.5 +/- 5.42 microV, 56.8 +/- 5.42 m/s, 3.01 +/- 0.31 ms, 0.12 +/- 0.04 microV, 16.4 +/- 2.95 m/s and 10.6 +/- 2.48 ms. More sophisticated equipment has an internal noise of 0.6 microVrms. These data demonstrate that the technique can now be employed to study thin fiber neuropathies, like in leprosy, using commercial electromyographs, even in non-academic practices.

TI  - Polymorphism of the IL-1 gene complex in Epstein-Barr virus seronegative and seropositive adult blood donors.  
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegativity is rare in adults. To examine whether genetic differences would explain this, we studied the genetic polymorphisms of the genes of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) complex in seronegative adults. These cytokines (i.e. IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1RA) regulate, in several ways, the inflammatory reactions of the body. In each of these genes there are polymorphic sites and the various alleles differ in their frequency in several diseases of inflammatory nature. In 400 healthy blood donors (from 18 to 60 years of age) there were 20 (5%) seronegative persons.  The frequency of allele 2 of the IL-1beta gene (base exchange polymorphism at position -511 from the transcriptional start site) was decreased in the seronegative patients (0.20 versus 0.42 in the seropositive patients, P < 0.05, chi2-test). Moreover, the frequency of allele 2 of the IL-1RA (polymorphism defined by variable numbers of 86-bp repeats in intron 2) was slightly, but not significantly, decreased in the seronegative patients. Alleles of these two loci are known to be associated, but in the seronegative patients this association was abnormal: 11 out of 20 (55%) were of the IL-1RA-2 negative/IL-1beta-2 negative type, while of the seropositive patients, 25% were of this type (P < 0.01, chi2-test). These data suggest that immunological differences, depending on cytokine gene polymorphisms, regulate the resistance to EBV infection.

TI  - [Twenty-four hour time and frequency domain variability of systolic blood pressure and heart rate in an experimental model of arterial hypertension plus obesity]  
AB  - Modifications of heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) variabilities (V) have been reported in the human syndrome arterial hypertension plus insulin-resistance. The aim of this study was to characterize the 24 h SBPV and HRV in both time and frequency domains during weight increase in dogs fed ad libitum with a high fat diet. Implantable transmitter units for measurement of blood pressure and heart rate were surgically implanted in five beagle male dogs. BP and HR were continuously recorded using telemetric measurements during 24 hours, before and after 6 and 9 weeks of hypercaloric diet in quiet animals submitted to a 12h light-dark cycle. To study nychtemeral cycle of SBP and HR, two periods were chosen: day (from 6.00 h to 19.00 h) and night (from 23.00 h to 6.00 h). Spontaneous baroreflex efficiency was measured using the sequence method. Spectral variability of HR and SBP was analyzed using a fast Fourier transformation on 512 consecutive values and normalized units of low (LF: 50-150 mHz, reflecting sympathetic activity) and high (HF: respiratory rate +/- 50 mHz, reflecting parasympathetic activity) frequency bands were calculated. The energy of total spectrum (from 0.004 to 1 Hz) was also studied. Body weight (12.4 +/- 0.9 vs 14.9 +/- 0.9 kg, p < 0.05). SBP (132 +/- 1 vs 147 +/- 1 mmHg, p < 0.05) significantly increased after 9 weeks of hypercaloric diet. A nycthemeral HR rhythm was present at baseline (day: 79 +/- 1 vs night: 71 +/- 1 bpm) but not after 9 weeks (day: 91 +/- 4 bpm ; night: 86 +/- 2 bpm). Concomitantly, the efficiency of spontaneous baroreflex decreased at 6 weeks (36 +/- 1 vs 42 +/- 2 mmHg/ms, p < 0.05). A significant decrease in HF energy of HRV was found after 6 but not after 9 weeks. LF energy of SBPV was increased at 6 but not at 9 weeks (table). [table: see text] In conclusion, this study shows that an hyperlipidic and hypercaloric diet induces transient variations in autonomic nervous system activity which could be the physiopathological link between obesity, insulin-resistance and arterial hypertension.

TI  - The effect of changing excitation frequency on parallel conductance in different sized hearts.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An important component of the ventricular volume measured using the conductance catheter technique is due to parallel conductance (Vc), which results from the extension of the electric field beyond the ventricular blood pool. Parallel conductance volume is normally estimated using the saline dilution method (Vc(saline dilution)), in which the conductivity of blood in the ventricle is transiently increased by injection of hypertonic saline. A simpler alternative has been reported by Gawne et al. [12]. Vc(dual frequency) is estimated from the difference in total conductance measured at two exciting frequencies and the method is based on the assumption that parallel conductance is mainly capacitive and hence is negligible at low frequency. The objective of this study was to determine whether the dual frequency technique could be used to substitute the saline dilution method to estimate Vc in different sized hearts. METHODS: The accuracy and linearity of a custom-built conductance catheter (CC) system was initially assessed in vitro. Subsequently, a CC and micromanometer were inserted into the left ventricle of seven 5 kg pigs (group 1) and six 50 kg pigs (group 2). Cardiac output was determined using thermodilution (group 1) and an ultrasonic flow probe (group 2) from which the slope coefficient (alpha) was determined. Steady state measurements and Vc estimated using saline dilution were performed at frequencies in the range of 5-40 kHz. All measurements were made at end-expiration. Finally, Vc was estimated from the change in end-systolic conductance between 5 kHz and 40 kHz using the dual frequency technique of Gawne et al. [12]. RESULTS: There was no change in measured volume of a simple insulated cylindrical model when the stimulating frequency was varied from 5-40 kHz. Vc(saline dilution) varied significantly with frequency in group 1 (8.63 +/- 2.74 ml at 5 kHz; 11.51 +/- 2.65 ml at 40 kHz) (p = 0.01). Similar results were obtained in group 2 (69.43 +/- 27.76 ml at 5 kHz; 101.24 +/- 15.21 ml at 40 kHz) (p < 0.001). However, the data indicate that the resistive component of the parallel conductance is substantial (Vc at 0 Hz estimated as 8.01 ml in group 1 and 62.3 ml in group 2). There was an increase in alpha with frequency in both groups but this did not reach significance. The correspondence between Vc(dual frequency) and Vc(saline dilution) methods was poor (group 1 R2 = 0.69; group 2 R2 = 0.22). CONCLUSION: At a lower excitation frequency of 5 kHz a smaller percentage of the electric current extends beyond the blood pool so parallel conductance is reduced. While parallel conductance is frequency dependent, it has a substantial resistive component. The dual frequency method is based on the assumption that parallel conductance is negligible at low frequencies and this is clearly not the case. The results of this study confirm that the dual frequency technique cannot be used to substitute the saline dilution technique.

TI  - A tactile sensor for detection of physical properties of human skin in vivo.  
AB  - A spring loaded tactile sensor with displacement sensing has been evaluated for non-invasive assessment of physical properties, stiffness and elasticity, of human skin in vivo. The tactile sensor consists of a peizoelectric vibrator (61 kHz) with a vibration pickup, electronics and PC with software for measurement of the change in frequency when the sensor is attached to an object. Integrated with the tactile sensor is a displacement sensor that shows the compression of the spring that loads the sensor element against the object during measurement. Under certain conditions (e.g. fixed contact pressure) this change in frequency monitors the acoustic impedance of the object and is related to the stiffness of soft tissue. The experimental results on silicone gum and on healthy Japanese and Swedish women indicated that the instrument was able to detect changes in stiffness and elastic related properties of human skin, related to age, day-to-day variations and application of cosmetics. The instrument was concluded to be easy to handle and suitable for field work.

AB  - Electropalatographic and F2 frequency data in /VlV/ sequences reveal more prominent C-to-V effects for Catalan dark /l/ than for German clear /l/, more so in the /i/ context than in the /a/ context, which is in agreement with the existence of high lingual requirements on the formation of two constriction places for dark /l/. German clear /l/ exerts a similar amount of F2 displacement on both vowels which may be indicative of the tongue dorsum being directed towards a target position; this is also suggested by dorsopalatal contact and formant frequency data showing less vowel-dependent variability than clear /l/ in other languages though more so than Catalan dark /l/. Salient anticipatory requirements for the implementation of /l/ in the two languages block V1-dependent carryover effects to a large extent which results in more prominent vocalic anticipation than vocalic carryover. This directionality trend in vocalic coarticulation is more obvious for Catalan dark /l/ than for German clear /l/ (in agreement with the former consonantal variety requiring more anticipation than the latter) and opposes German /l/ to clear /l/ in other languages (i.e., the less constrained /l/ variety of Spanish may favor vocalic carryover over vocalic anticipation in VCV sequences).

TI  - Temporal evolution of coherence and power in the human sleep electroencephalogram.  
AB  - Coherence analysis of the human sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to investigate relations between brain regions. In all-night EEG recordings from eight young subjects, the temporal evolution of power and coherence spectra within and between cerebral hemispheres was investigated from bipolar derivations along the antero-posterior axis. Distinct peaks in the power and coherence spectra were present in NREM sleep but not in REM sleep. They were situated in the frequency range of sleep spindles (13-14 Hz), alpha band (9-10 Hz) and low delta band (1-2 Hz). Whereas the peaks coincided in the power and coherence spectra, a dissociation of their temporal evolution was observed. In the low delta band, only power but not coherence showed a decline across successive NREM sleep episodes. Moreover, power increased gradually in the first part of a NREM sleep episode, whereas coherence showed a rapid rise. The results indicate that the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherence of EEG activity attains readily a high level in NREM sleep and is largely independent of the signal amplitude.

TI  - Effect of myocardial hypertrophy on systolic and diastolic function in children: insights from the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relationships.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of myocardial hypertrophy on systolic and diastolic properties of the left ventricle in children. BACKGROUND: In children with myocardial hypertrophy, ejection phase indices are invariably increased. However, indices of force-generation, e.g., end-systolic elastance and invasive indices of diastolic properties, have been studied infrequently in children with myocardial hypertrophy. METHODS: We studied 10 children with congenital aortic stenosis or coarctation of aorta and nine control patients. Systolic properties were assessed from shortening fraction, end-systolic fiber elastance (Ef(es)) measured at resting heart rates, and force-frequency relationship measured at heart rates increasing from 110 to 160 beats per minute. Diastolic properties were assessed from time constant of relaxation (tau) at matched heart rates, chamber stiffness constant, myocardial stiffness constant, and relaxation-frequency relationship measured at gradually increasing heart rates. RESULTS: Ef(es) remained unchanged by myocardial hypertrophy, however, tau was prolonged (tauL: 27.3+/-2.3 vs. 21.8+/-2.2 ms, p < 0.001; and tauD: 43.2+/-3.1 vs. 34.3+/-3.3 ms, p < 0.001). Both chamber and myocardial stiffness constants remained unchanged. Incremental increases in heart rate produced incremental improvement in both contraction and relaxation. Slopes of force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relationships remained unchanged in the experimental group. However, the relaxation-frequency relationship manifested a parallel shift upward. CONCLUSIONS: In conscious, sedated children with myocardial hypertrophy, systolic function assessed by an index of force generation remains unchanged. However, relaxation is prolonged but passive diastolic properties remain unaffected. The combined effect of hypertrophy and heart rate does not alter the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relationships.

TI  - Neck and other muscle pains in autonomic failure: their association with orthostatic hypotension.  
AB  - Neck pain in the suboccipital and paracervical region ('coathanger' configuration) is often reported by patients with autonomic failure and orthostatic hypotension. The frequency of this pain, along with pains in the buttock and calf regions, was determined by questionnaire in two major groups with primary chronic autonomic failure--pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Comparisons were made with Parkinson's disease, cerebellar degeneration and other disorders in which neurological symptoms overlap but in which there was neither autonomic failure nor orthostatic hypotension. Neck pain was present in 93% of patients with PAF, 51% of patients with MSA and 38-47% of the non-autonomic groups. Buttock pain was present in smaller but similar proportions (8-19%) of each group, like calf pain (23-37%). Neck pain in PAF and MSA differed from that in the other groups in being relieved by sitting or lying flat and in being associated with factors that lower blood pressure in these patients. Buttock pain was posturally related in PAF and MSA; for calf pain there was no difference between groups. Neck pain was related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; in PAF patients, whose postural blood-pressure fall was greater than that in MSA, there was a greater frequency of neck pain.

TI  - Low dose effects of chemicals as assessed by the flow cytometric in vivo micronucleus assay.  
AB  - Using flow cytometric automation of the mouse in vivo, micronucleus assay increases the sensitivity of the test. This is achieved through a very large increase in the number of cells scored, by a factor of 100x, which in turn greatly reduces the sampling error. With this method, dose-response relationships of in vivo micronucleus induction for four model agents mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB), cyclophosphamide (CPA), and colchicine (COL) were studied at low dose levels. For the three clastogens MMC, DEB and CPA, linear dose-response relationships were found over the dose ranges studied, even in the very low dose region (defined as the dose region where the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes is less than twice the baseline frequency). This is consistent with the view that no threshold should exist for genotoxic agents which target DNA. For COL a dose range was found, in which the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes did not increase with dose, possibly indicating an in vivo threshold. The flow cytometric in vivo micronucleus assay represents one possibility for in vivo low dose-response studies. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Targeted disruption of the bradyzoite-specific gene BAG1 does not prevent tissue cyst formation in Toxoplasma gondii.  
AB  - Expression of the 30 kDa small heat shock protein BAG1 is restricted to the latent bradyzoite 'tissue cyst' form of Toxoplasma gondii, first appearing approximately 2-3 days after the initiation of bradyzoite differentiation. Although developmental expression of small heat shock proteins has been described for many species, their precise function is unclear. In order to examine the function of BAG1 in T. gondii bradyzoites and its role during parasite differentiation, we have used homologous recombination to produce a knock-out mutant in the cyst-forming strain P(LK), a clonal derivative of ME49. Under tissue culture conditions that stimulate bradyzoite differentiation (alkaline pH), the mutant was found to express several bradyzoite-specific markers with the same kinetics and frequency as the parental strain. Neither enhanced nor decreased susceptibility to stress was observed for the BAG1-deficient mutant. In vivo studies revealed that tachyzoites of the bag1 knock-out mutant were fully able to establish a chronic infection in C57BL/6 mice, producing brain cysts of a size, morphology and frequency indistinguishable from cysts formed by the parental control strain. Brain cysts of the bag1 knock-out mutant contained viable parasites capable of establishing an acute infection after oral administration, demonstrating that conversion of bradyzoites to tachyzoites is also unimpaired. We conclude that BAG1 is not essential for normal function of bradyzoite containing tissue cysts, at least in intermediate host species. This clone of P(LK) was found to be unable to produce oocysts and is therefore unsuitable for studies in cats.

Treatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine L-NMMA (300 microM), a competitive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, did not modify isometric developed tension (IDT) and frequency of contractions (FC) on day 5 of psp; on day 8, tissue pretreated with L-NMMA showed an increase in the IDT and FC compared with controls, while on day 9 of psp, both IDT and FC showed a lower stability after treatment with the inhibitor.

TI  - Regulation by nitric oxide of prostaglandin E synthesis and spontaneous motility in rat uterine tissue.  
AB  - We explored the role of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in the spontaneous motility of uterine tissue from pseudopregnant (psp) rats and the correlation between this action and the uterotonic prostaglandin (PG) E production. We worked in the early psp (on day 5 of psp), and in late psp (on day 8 and day 9). Treatment with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine L-NMMA (300 microM), a competitive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, did not modify isometric developed tension (IDT) and frequency of contractions (FC) on day 5 of psp; on day 8, tissue pretreated with L-NMMA showed an increase in the IDT and FC compared with controls, while on day 9 of psp, both IDT and FC showed a lower stability after treatment with the inhibitor. These data suggest that NO modulates uterine motility on day 8 (decreasing it) and on day 9 of psp (enhancing it). We also evaluated the total NOS activity and that of its isoforms at the three times mentioned, demonstrating that total NOS activity was higher on day 5 of psp and decreased with psp development. On day 5 of psp, calcium-dependent and calcium-independent NOS each forms around 50% of total NOS activity. On day 8 of psp, the calcium-dependent was the predominant NOS form, while on day 9 of psp, the uterine tissue showed a higher calcium-independent form of the enzyme. In view of the fact that we found an inhibitor effect of the endogenous NO in uterine contractility on day 8 of psp and an inverse action on day 9 of psp (enhancing uterine contractility), we suggest that the NOS calcium-dependent form could be responsible for uterine contractility in psp rats. Finally, we evaluated the relationship between endogenous NO and PGE production. We observed that on days 5 and 8 of psp, the L-NMMA (300 microM) treatment did not affect PGE production, but on day 9 of psp, the preincubation with the NOS inhibitor diminished PGE synthesis, suggesting that at this time endogenous NO can upregulate uterine PGE production. These results confirm that NO can modulate uterine motility by means of PGE production. In summary, we suggest that in uterine tissue from psp rats, the NO system can alternatively decrease or increase uterine contractions, this last effect by enhancing uterine PGE synthesis.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic effects of two different hypericum extracts in healthy volunteers measured by quantitative EEG.  
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial (phase I) was performed to evaluate the central pharmacodynamic effects of two hypericum extracts with different contents of hyperforin (0.5% and 5.0%) but identical hypericin content. Three groups of 18 volunteers between 18 and 35 years of age participated in the trial. The volunteers receiving verum took 900 mg of the extract once a day for 8 consecutive days. The primary aim of this study was to observe the frequency bands, i.e., delta (1.25-4.5 Hz), theta (4.75-6.75 Hz), alpha-1 (7.0-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (9.75-12.5 Hz), beta-1 (12.75-18.5 Hz), and beta-2 (18.75-35 Hz). This was the first study of its kind testing hypericum controlled on the basis of its hyperforin contents. A quantitative topographic EEG (qEEG) was performed on days 1 and 8 as an indicator of drug-induced pharmacological action. The volunteers' electrophysiological data were obtained prior to application and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours post administration. Plasma samples for evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of hyperforin were also obtained. The qEEG results of the placebo group on days 1 and 8 showed no significant changes with regard to their physiological daily rhythm. In both verum groups (0.5% and 5.0% hyperforin content), reproducible central pharmacodynamic effects were apparent in comparison to placebo, in particular with the extract containing 5.0% of hyperforin. A peak pharmacodynamic efficacy was observed between 4 and 8 hours post administration. These results were confirmed on day 8 of the trial. The extract containing 5.0% hyperforin showed a marked tendency to produce higher increases in qEEG baseline power performances than the one containing 0.5% hyperforin. These higher baseline outputs on day 8 were seen at the delta, theta, and alpha-1 frequency values. Compared to placebo there was a significant increase in qEEG power performance in the delta and beta-1 frequency values exclusively for the extract containing 5.0% hyperforin. The theta and alpha-1 frequency values showed a noticeable tendency more emphasized on day 8 than on day 1. Preclinical trials in rats have been observed with similar changes in the frequency bands mentioned above, especially in the cholinergic (delta), noradrenergic (theta) and serotonergic (alpha) neurotransmitter systems. These experimental findings suggest that hypericum extracts with a high hyperforin content have a shielding effect on the central nervous system.

TI  - Effect of tidal volume and frequency on airway responsiveness in mechanically ventilated rabbits.  
AB  - We evaluated the effects of the rate and volume of tidal ventilation on airway resistance (Raw) during intravenous methacholine (MCh) challenge in mechanically ventilated rabbits. Five rabbits were challenged at tidal volumes of 5, 10, and 20 ml/kg at a frequency of 15 breaths/min and also under static conditions (0 ml/kg tidal volume). Four rabbits were subjected to MCh challenge at frequencies of 6 and 30 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and also under static conditions. In both groups, the increase in Raw with MCh challenge was significantly greater under static conditions than during tidal ventilation at any frequency or volume. Increases in the volume or frequency of tidal ventilation resulted in significant decreases in Raw in response to MCh. We conclude that tidal breathing suppresses airway responsiveness in rabbits in vivo. The suppression of narrowing in response to MCh increases as the magnitude of the volume or the frequency of the tidal oscillations is increased. Our findings suggest that the effect of lung volume changes on airway responsiveness in vivo is primarily related to the stretch of airway smooth muscle.

TI  - Isoflurane and pentobarbital reduce the frequency of transient ischemic depolarizations during focal ischemia in rats.  
AB  - Repetitive transient ischemic depolarizations (IDs) during focal cerebral ischemia are thought to contribute to ischemic damage. Isoflurane and pentobarbital reduce injury (versus the nonanesthetized state) after focal cerebral ischemia. The mechanism by which these drugs reduce injury is not known. This protective effect might be mediated by a reduction in the number of IDs. We measured the frequency of IDs during focal cerebral ischemia in animals anesthetized with isoflurane or pentobarbital and compared it with that in N2O/fentanyl anesthetized animals and in animals in which the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 (dizocilpine) was given. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for a period of 2 h. Cortical infarct volumes were determined after 3 h of reperfusion by image analysis of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium-stained coronal brain sections. The infarct volume was significantly greater in the N2O/fentanyl group than in the other three groups. Infarct volumes in the isoflurane, pentobarbital, and MK801 groups were similar. The frequency of IDs was significantly greater in the N2O/fentanyl group than in the other three groups, and was the least in the MK801 group. There was a direct correlation between the number of IDs and the volume of tissue injury. The data indicate that the protective effect of isoflurane and pentobarbital might, in part, be determined by their ability to reduce IDs during focal ischemia. However, the observation that the infarct volume was similar in the MK801, isoflurane, and pentobarbital groups, despite a greater frequency of IDs in the latter two groups, suggests that mechanisms other than a simple reduction in the number of IDs probably also play a role in anesthetic-mediated cerebral protection. Implications: Transient ischemic depolarizations during focal ischemia contribute to brain injury. Both isoflurane and pentobarbital reduced the frequency of these depolarizations. Isoflurane- and pentobarbital-mediated reduction in the frequency of depolarizations might, in part, mediate the previously documented neuroprotective effect of these drugs.

Forskolin, SNP, nicorandil, dibutyryl-cAMP, and adenosine increased the frequency of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ (KCa) currents ["spontaneous transient outward currents" (STOCs)] by two- to threefold, consistent with Ca2+ sparks activating STOCs.

TI  - Frequency modulation of Ca2+ sparks is involved in regulation of arterial diameter by cyclic nucleotides.  
AB  - Forskolin, which elevates cAMP levels, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nicorandil, which elevate cGMP levels, increased, by two- to threefold, the frequency of subcellular Ca2+ release ("Ca2+ sparks") through ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release (RyR) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of myocytes isolated from cerebral and coronary arteries of rats. Forskolin, SNP, nicorandil, dibutyryl-cAMP, and adenosine increased the frequency of Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ (KCa) currents ["spontaneous transient outward currents" (STOCs)] by two- to threefold, consistent with Ca2+ sparks activating STOCs. These agents also increased the mean amplitude of STOCs by 1.3-fold, an effect that could be explained by activation of KCa channels, independent of effects on Ca2+ sparks. To test the hypothesis that cAMP could act to dilate arteries through activation of the Ca2+ spark-->KCa channel pathway, the effects of blockers of KCa channels (iberiotoxin) and of Ca2+ sparks (ryanodine) on forskolin-induced dilations of pressurized cerebral arteries were examined. Forskolin-induced dilations were partially inhibited by iberiotoxin and ryanodine (with no additive effects) and were entirely prevented by elevating external K+. Forskolin lowered average Ca2+ in pressurized arteries while increasing ryanodine-sensitive, caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients. These experiments suggest a new mechanism for cyclic nucleotide-mediated dilations through an increase in Ca2+ spark frequency, caused by effects on SR Ca2+ load and possibly on the RyR channel, which leads to increased STOC frequency, membrane potential hyperpolarization, closure of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, decrease in arterial wall Ca2+, and, ultimately, vasodilation.
