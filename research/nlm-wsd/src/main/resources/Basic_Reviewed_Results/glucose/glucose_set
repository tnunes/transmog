TI  - Effect of dietary sodium on insulin sensitivity in older, obese, sedentary hypertensives.  
AB  - Increased dietary sodium intake has been associated with an increase in blood pressure as well as a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose disposal in young healthy adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary sodium intake is associated with changes in oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure in older, sedentary, overweight hypertensives. Eight older (70.0 +/- 1.4 years, mean +/- SEM), overweight (40.2 +/- 3.1% body fat), mildly hypertensive (151 +/- 8/82 +/- 2 mm Hg) patients with a fasting plasma glucose < 7.8 mmol/L were studied after 2 weeks on low (3 g/day) and 2 weeks on high (10 g/day) sodium diets. To examine carbohydrate metabolism we performed a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test and a two-dose (240 and 600 pmol/m2/min) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp at the end of each sodium diet. High sodium intake was associated with a significantly greater urinary sodium excretion (364 +/- 45 mmol/day v 112 +/- 21 mmol/day; P < .0001). The increase in dietary sodium from low to high did not result in significant differences in fasting plasma glucose (6.0 +/- 0.2 v 5.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/L, P = .20) or insulin (72.5 +/- 7.8 v 69.9 +/- 12.4 pmol/L, P = 0.71) levels or in the glucose (374.0 +/- 50.8 v 493.2 +/- 45.0 mmol/min/L, P = .12) and insulin (43,783 +/- 10,278 v 44,110 +/- 12,392 pmol/min/L, P = .96) areas determined during the oral glucose tolerance test. Similarly, there was no effect of dietary sodium on insulin-mediated glucose disposal at low (5.87 +/- 1.02 v 5.60 +/- 0.94 mg/kgLBM/min, P = .36) or high (12.15 +/- 1.49 v 11.91 +/- 1.49 mg/kgLBM/min, P = .64) insulin infusion rates. Our findings suggest that, in insulin resistant hypertensives, increased dietary sodium does not affect either glucose or insulin responses during an oral glucose tolerance test or glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.

TI  - Labeling of recombinant protein for NMR spectroscopy: global and specific labeling of the rat liver fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase domain.  
AB  - Methods for the efficient use of the 13C-labeled nutrients, glucose and histidine, in the production of recombinant protein were developed to provide the large amount of sample required for NMR studies. The nutrient requirements were reduced by determining the minimum amount of these metabolites needed during both the growth and the induction phases of the BL21(DE3) and newly constructed BL21(DE3) histidine auxotrophic Escherichia coli cultures. These methods were developed using the separate bisphosphatase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/ fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, which is expressed to high levels in the pET3a/BL21 (DE3) bacterial system. Use of the optimized expression methods reduced the requirements for the labeled nutrients, glucose and histidine, by 90 and 93.8%, respectively. The savings realized by use of the minimized media and modified induction protocols were obtained without significant reduction of the yield of purified protein. Comprehensive study of the bisphosphatase domain by NMR spectroscopy requires large amounts of protein because of its low solubility and the short lifetime (2-3 days) of the NMR samples. The significant reduction in the costs of labeled protein samples realized by the optimized expression methods can meet these sample requirements in a cost-effective way, and thereby, allow NMR studies of the bisphosphatase domain to proceed.

TI  - Cloning and expression of a gene cluster encoding three subunits of membrane-bound gluconate dehydrogenase from Erwinia cypripedii ATCC 29267 in Escherichia coli.  
AB  - We have cloned the gene cluster encoding three subunits of membrane-bound gluconate dehydrogenase (GADH) from Erwinia cypripedii ATCC 29267 in Escherichia coli by performing a direct-expression assay. The positive clone converted D-gluconate to 2-keto-D-gluconate (2KDG) in the culture medium. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the GADH clone revealed that the cloned fragment contained the complete structural genes for a 68-kDa dehydrogenase subunit, a 47-kDa cytochrome c subunit, and a 24-kDa subunit of unknown function and that the genes were clustered with the same transcriptional polarity. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences and the NH2-terminal sequences determined for the purified protein indicated that the dehydrogenase, cytochrome c, and 24-kDa subunits contained typical signal peptides of 22, 19, and 42 amino acids, respectively. The molecular masses of the processed subunits deduced from the nucleotide sequences (65, 45, and 20 kDa) coincided well with the molecular masses of subunits estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In E. cypripedii and recombinant E. coli, the GADH was constitutively formed and the activity of GADH was enhanced more than twofold by addition of D-gluconate to the medium. The holoenzyme glucose dehydrogenase of E. coli was reconstituted by addition of pyrroloquinoline quinone to the culture medium, and the conversion of D-glucose or D-gluconate to 2KDG by recombinant E. coli harboring the cloned GADH gene was attempted in batch culture. The conversion yields for D-glucose were 0.95 mol of 2KDG/mol of D-glucose after 16 h of cultivation, and those for D-gluconate were 0.95 mol of 2KDG/mol of D-gluconate after 12 h of cultivation.

TI  - Retrobiosynthetic NMR studies with 13C-labeled glucose. Formation of gallic acid in plants and fungi.  
AB  - The biosynthesis of gallic acid was studied in cultures of the fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus and in leaves of the tree Rhus typhina. Fungal cultures were grown with [1-13C]glucose or with a mixture of unlabeled glucose and [U-13C6]glucose. Young leaves of R. typhina were kept in an incubation chamber and were supplied with a solution containing a mixture of unlabeled glucose and [U-13C6]glucose via the leaf stem. Isotope distributions in isolated gallic acid and aromatic amino acids were analyzed by one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of the complex isotopomer composition of metabolites was obtained by deconvolution of the 13C13C coupling multiplets using numerical simulation methods. This approach required the accurate analysis of heavy isotope chemical shift effects in a variety of different isotopomers and the analysis of long range 13C13C coupling constants. The resulting isotopomer patterns were interpreted using a retrobiosynthetic approach based on a comparison between the isotopomer patterns of gallic acid and tyrosine. The data show that both in the fungus and in the plant all carbon atoms of gallic acid are biosynthetically equivalent to carbon atoms of shikimate. Notably, the carboxylic group of gallic acid is derived from the carboxylic group of an early intermediate of the shikimate pathway and not from the side chain of phenylalanine or tyrosine. It follows that the committed precursor of gallic acid is an intermediate of the shikimate pathway prior to prephenate or arogenate, most probably 5-dehydroshikimate. A formation of gallic acid via phenylalanine, the lignin precursor, caffeic acid, or 3,4, 5-trihydroxycinnamic acid can be ruled out as major pathways in the fungus and in young leaves of R. typhina. The incorporation of uniformly 13C-labeled glucose followed by quantitative NMR analysis of isotopomer patterns is suggested as a general method for biosynthetic studies. As shown by the plant experiment, this approach is also applicable to systems with low incorporation rates.

TI  - A 13C mass isotopomer study of anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation in perfused rat hearts.  
AB  - Anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation was examined in hearts perfused with physiological concentrations of glucose, [U-13C3]lactate, and [U-13C3]pyruvate. Also, a fatty acid, [1-13C]octanoate, or ketone bodies were added at concentrations providing acetyl-CoA at a rate resulting in either low or substantial pyruvate decarboxylation. Relative contributions of pyruvate and fatty acids to citrate synthesis were determined from the 13C labeling pattern of effluent citrate by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (see companion article, Comte, B., Vincent, G., Bouchard, B., and Des Rosiers, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26117-26124). Precision on flux measurements of anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation depended on the mix of substrates supplied to the heart. Anaplerotic fluxes were precisely determined under conditions where acetyl-CoA was predominantly supplied by beta-oxidation, as it occurred with 0.2 or 1 mM octanoate. Then, anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation provided 3-8% of the OAA moiety of citrate and was modulated by concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in the physiological range. Also, the contribution of pyruvate to citrate formation through carboxylation was equal to or greater than through decarboxylation. Furthermore, 13C labeling data on tissue citric acid cycle intermediates and pyruvate suggest that (i) anaplerosis occurs also at succinate and (ii) cataplerotic malate decarboxylation is low. Rather, the presence of citrate in the effluent perfusate of hearts perfused with physiological concentrations of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate and concentrations of octanoate leading to maximal oxidative rates suggests a cataplerotic citrate efflux from mitochondria to cytosol. Taken altogether, our data raise the possibility of a link between pyruvate carboxylation and mitochondrial citrate efflux. In view of the proposed feedback regulation of glycolysis by cytosolic citrate, such a link would support a role of anaplerosis and cataplerosis in metabolic signal transmission between mitochondria and cytosol in the normoxic heart.

TI  - Cortisol reduces hippocampal glucose metabolism in normal elderly, but not in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - Glucocorticoids are known to play a role in the regulation of peripheral glucose mobilization and metabolism. Although several animal studies have shown that hippocampal glucose metabolism is reduced acutely and chronically by the action of corticosterone and that excess glucocorticoids are harmful to hippocampal neurons, little is known about the central effects of glucocorticoids in the human. In this study we examined the brain glucose utilization (CMRglu) response to hydrocortisone (cortisol) in seven normal elderly and eight Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. On 2 separate days, immediately after the administration of a bolus of either 35 mg hydrocortisone or placebo, we administered 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose. After a 35-min radiotracer uptake period, positron emission tomography (PET) images were collected. PET CMRglu images were analyzed using two methods: an image transformation that allowed analyses across cases on a voxel by voxel basis, and an anatomically based region of interest method that used coregistered magnetic resonance imaging scans. Both image analysis methods yielded similar results, identifying relative to placebo, a specific hippocampal CMRglu reduction in response to the hydrocortisone challenge that was restricted to the normal group. The region of interest technique showed CMRglu reductions of 16% and 12% in the right and left hippocampi, respectively. Blood collected during the PET scans showed, for the normal group, a rise in plasma glucose levels, starting approximately 25 min after hydrocortisone administration. The AD group did not show this effect. Baseline cortisol was elevated in the AD group, but the clearance of hydrocortisone was not different between the groups. In conclusion, these data show that among normal individuals in the presence of a pharmacological dose of cortisol, the glucose utilization of the hippocampus is specifically reduced, and serum glucose levels increase. Based in part on other studies, we offer the interpretation that glucocorticoid-mediated regulation of glucose transport is altered in AD, and this may underlie both the hippocampal insensitivity to cortisol and the failure in these patients to mount a peripheral glucose response. As our findings could reflect an altered state of the AD patients, we interpret our results as preliminary with respect to evidence for metabolic abnormalities in AD. The results suggest the continued study of the hydrocortisone challenge as a test of hippocampal responsivity.

TI  - A temporary local energy pool coupled to neuronal activity: fluctuations of extracellular lactate levels in rat brain monitored with rapid-response enzyme-based sensor.  
AB  - A successfully developed enzyme-based lactate microsensor with rapid response time allows the direct and continuous in vivo measurement of lactic acid concentration with high temporal resolution in brain extracellular fluid. The fluctuations coupled to neuronal activity in extracellular lactate concentration were explored in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the rat brain after electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway.  Extracellular glucose and oxygen levels were also detected simultaneously by coimplantation of a fast-response glucose sensor and an oxygen electrode, to provide novel information of trafficking of energy substances in real time related to local neuronal activity. The results first give a comprehensive picture of complementary energy supply and use of lactate and glucose in the intact brain tissue. In response to acute neuronal activation, the brain tissue shifts immediately to significant energy supply by lactate. A local temporary fuel "reservoir" is established behind the blood-brain barrier, evidenced by increased extracellular lactate concentration. The pool can be depleted rapidly, up to 28% in 10-12 s, by massive, acute neuronal use after stimulation and can be replenished in approximately 20 s. Glutamate-stimulated astrocytic glycolysis and the increase of regional blood flow may regulate the lactate concentration of the pool in different time scales to maintain local energy homeostasis.

TI  - Glucose transporters of the glomerulus and the implications for diabetic nephropathy.  
AB  - Several glucose transporters have recently been identified in glomeruli, and in cultured glomerular cells. These include the facilitative glucose transporter isoforms GLUTs 1, 3 and 4, and sodium-glucose cotransport activity with characteristics of SGLT1. GLUTs 1, 3 and 4 are all high affinity, low capacity, facilitative glucose transporters which typically would be saturated at or near physiologic glucose concentrations. The SGLT transporter of mesangial cells is also a high affinity transporter which similarly could be saturated under normal glucose conditions. This suggests that in order for mesangial cells to take up excessive quantities of glucose in diabetes, changes in glucose transporter expression, translocation or activity may be required. Accordingly, recent investigations discovered positive-feedback regulation of the mesangial cell GLUT1 transporter by glucose, and a regulatory role for GLUT1 in glucose metabolism and extracellular matrix synthesis. Future investigations of glucose transporters in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease will now likely proceed in multiple directions, including but not limited to: (1) examination of their regulation by growth factors implicated in diabetic nephropathy, and the resultant effects on ECM synthesis; (2) determination of the mechanisms by which GLUT1 regulates the expression of aldose reductase, PKC, GLUT1, and other genes in the mesangial cell; and (3) Suppression of glucose transporters in attempts to prevent high glucose-induced diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

TI  - Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol stimulates glucose utilization in C6 glioma cells.  
AB  - The present work was undertaken to study the metabolic response of C6 glioma cells to physiologically relevant doses of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active component of marijuana. At those concentrations (i.e. nanomolar range), THC produced a dose-dependent increase in the rates of glucose oxidation to CO2 and glucose incorporation into phospholipids and glycogen. The THC-induced stimulation of glucose utilization was (i) dose-dependent up to 100 nM THC, (ii) mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210, and (iii) prevented by pertussis toxin and the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. In contrast to THC, forskolin markedly depressed CO2 production, phospholipid synthesis and glycogen synthesis from glucose. The forskolin-induced inhibition of glucose utilization was (i) mimicked by dibutyryl-cAMP, and (ii) prevented by THC, HU-210 and H-7, an inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Likewise, THC was able to antagonize in part the forskolin-induced elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration, and this antagonistic effect was prevented by SR141716A. However, THC per se did not affect basal cAMP concentration. Results thus indicate that physiologically relevant doses of THC stimulate glucose metabolism in C6 glioma cells through a cannabinoid receptor-mediated process. Although cannabinoid receptors may be coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in C6 glioma cells, this does not seem to be the mechanism involved in the THC-induced stimulation of glucose metabolism.

TI  - Assessment of hepatic sensitivity to glucagon in NIDDM: use as a tool to estimate the contribution of the indirect pathway to nocturnal glycogen synthesis.  
AB  - NIDDM is associated with excessive rates of endogenous glucose production in both the postabsorptive and postprandial states. To determine whether this is due to an intrinsic increase in hepatic sensitivity to glucagon, 9 NIDDM and 10 nondiabetic subjects were studied on three occasions. On each occasion, glycogen was labeled the evening before the study with subjects ingesting meals containing [6-3H]galactose. Beginning at 6:00 A.M. on the following morning, somatostatin was infused to inhibit endogenous hormone secretion. Insulin concentrations were maintained constant at basal levels (defined as that necessary to keep glucose at approximately 5 mmol/l) in each individual. On one occasion, glucagon was infused at a rate of 0.65 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) throughout the experiment, resulting in glucagon concentrations of approximately 130 pg/ml and a slow but comparable fall in endogenous glucose production with time in both groups. On the other two occasions, the glucagon infusion was increased at 10:00 A.M. to either 1.5 or 3.0 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1), resulting in an increase in glucagon concentrations to approximately 180 and 310 pg/ml, respectively. The increment in endogenous glucose production (i.e., area above basal) did not differ in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects during either the 1.5 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) (0.75 +/- 0.055 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.048 mmol/kg) or 3.0 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) (1.06 +/- 0.066 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.073 mmol/kg) glucagon infusions. In contrast, the amount of [6-3H]glucose released from glycogen was lower (P < 0.05) in the diabetic than nondiabetic subjects during both glucagon infusions. The specific activity of glycogen, calculated as the integrated release of [6-3H]glucose divided by the integrated release of unlabeled glucose, was lower (P < 0.05) in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects during both the 1.5 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) (19.0 +/- 3.9 vs. 41.4 +/- 5.7 dpm/micromol) and 3.0 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1) (19.1 +/- 3.1 vs. 36.5 +/- 7.2 dpm/micromol) glucagon infusions, implying that a greater portion of the glucose released from glycogen was derived from the indirect pathway. We concluded that although NIDDM is not associated with an intrinsic alteration in hepatic sensitivity to glucagon, it does alter the relative contributions of the direct and indirect pathways to nocturnal glycogen synthesis.

TI  - Heat shock-induced protection and enhancement of Na+-glucose cotransport by LLC-PK1 monolayers.  
AB  - Monolayers of the porcine-derived renal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, were used to characterize the effects of heat stress on Na+-glucose cotransport. Transepithelial current dependent on 5 mM glucose (I(Glc)), phloridzin-sensitive current (I(phz)), and total transepithelial current (I(total)) were measured as indicators of Na+-glucose cotransport. Severe heat shock (SHS; 45 degrees C for 1 h, then 37 degrees C for measurements) decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), I(Glc), I(phz), and I(total) 50-70%. Mild heat shock (MHS; 42 degrees C for 3 h, then 37 degrees C for 12 h) induced accumulation of 72-kDa heat shock protein (HSP-72), decreased damage to TER from SHS, and prevented damage to I(Glc), I(phz), and I(total). Kinetic analysis showed that SHS damaged and MHS protected total Na+-glucose transport capacity (Vmax of I(Glc)). MHS alone increased TER (50%), I(Glc) (20%), I(total) (20%), and Vmax of I(Glc) (25%). On enhancement of the Na+ gradient by depletion of intracellular Na+, MHS increased I(Glc) 50% and had no effect on transepithelial Na+-dependent sulfate reabsorptive flux measured concurrently or in Na+-replete tissues. These effects of MHS were not reflected in effects on cell survival or luminal membrane surface area as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase or alkaline phosphatase release. In conclusion, HSP-72-inducing heat treatment both protected and enhanced Na+-glucose cotransport independently of the luminal membrane Na+ gradient and selectively with respect to effects on TER, reabsorptive sulfate transport, cell survival, and luminal membrane surface area.

TI  - The hot IVGTT two-compartment minimal model: indexes of glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity.  
AB  - A two-compartment minimal model (2CMM) has been proposed [A. Caumo and C. Cobelli. Am. J. Physiol. 264 (Endocrinol. Metab. 27): E829-E841, 1993] to describe intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) labeled (hereafter hot) glucose kinetics. This model, at variance with the one-compartment minimal model (1CMM), allows the estimation of a plausible profile of glucose production. The aim of this study is to show that the 2CMM also allows the assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI2*), glucose effectiveness (SG2*), and plasma clearance rate (PCR). The 2CMM was identified on stable-isotope IVGTTs performed in normal subjects (n = 14). Results were (means +/- SE) SG2* = 0.85 +/- 0.14 ml.kg-1.min-1, PCR = 2.02 +/- 0.14 ml.kg-1.min-1, and SI2* = 13.83 +/- 2.54 x 10(-2) ml.kg-1.min-1.microU-1.ml. The 1CMM was also identified; glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity indexes were SG*V = 1.36 +/- 0.08 ml.kg-1.min-1 and SI*V = 12.98 +/- 2.21 x 10(-2) ml.kg-1.min-1.microU-1.ml, respectively, where V is the 1CMM glucose distribution volume. SG*V was lower than PCR and higher than SG2* and did not correlate with either [r = 0.45 (NS) and r = 0.50 (NS), respectively], whereas SI*V was not different from and was correlated with SI2* (r = 0.95; P < 0.001). SG* compares well (r = 0.78; P < 0.001) with PCR normalized by the 2CMM total glucose distribution volume. In conclusion, the 2CMM is a powerful tool to assess glucose metabolism in vivo.

TI  - Gastric branch vagotomy and gastric emptying during and after intragastric infusion of glucose.  
AB  - The effect of gastric branch vagotomy (GVX) on the gastric emptying of glucose was evaluated during two phases of emptying control: as the stomach fills and in the postload period. GVX and control rats received a series of intragastric glucose infusions (1.0 ml/min) through indwelling gastric fistulas. In experiment 1, gastric samples were withdrawn either immediately after the offset of 9- or 18-min infusions of 12.5% glucose or at various times up to 36 min postinfusion. In experiment 2, samples were withdrawn either immediately or 30 min after termination of 12-min infusions of 12.5 or 25% glucose. After gastric fill, glucose solute emptying rate was stable over time not influenced by concentration doubling, and, surprisingly, not affected by GVX. During gastric fill, solute emptying rate doubled with concentration in both GVX and control rats. For each concentration, however, glucose emptied during fill at almost twice the rate in GVX compared with control rats. This accelerated emptying of glucose during fill in GVX rats is consistent with a gastric vagal contribution to inhibitory mechanisms (e.g., receptive relaxation) that operate as the stomach fills under normal conditions. The absence of a GVX effect on emptying after fill suggests either that gastric branch vagal efferents play little role in feedback inhibitory control of glucose emptying under normal conditions or that other systems compensate for the function previously served by vagal gastric branch efferents. Further work is required to address the possible role of the gastric vagus in feedback control of gastric emptying when nutritive fluids other than glucose are delivered.

TI  -  Glucose modulates hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide in rabbits.  
AB  - Glucose is important for vascular and immunocompetent cell functions. We hypothesized that modifications in glucose metabolism (normal feeding, 24-h fasting, glucose loading) may influence the hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide administration (LPS; 600 micrograms/kg iv) in rabbits. Aortic (ABFV), hepatic artery (HABFV), and portal vein blood flow velocities (PVBFV) (pulsed Doppler), plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitrites were measured. Fasting depleted hepatic glycogen content, and intraportal glucose load (2 g/kg) partially restored it. LPS induced a similar hypotension (-20%, P < 0.05) in three groups of animals. In fed animals, systemic vasoconstriction occurred with low ABFV and PVBFV (-40%, P < 0.05), together with lactacidemia and hyperglycemia. In fasted animals, ABFV and PVBFV were maintained, without metabolic acidosis or hyperglycemia. Glucose loading induced hemodynamic and metabolic patterns comparable to those observed in fed animals, although significantly more severe. TNF release was amplified fourfold by glucose loading, with no impact on nitrite levels. In conclusion, glucose metabolism interferes with hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory responses to LPS.

TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene transcription and hyperglycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids in genetically obese db/db transgenic mice.  
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription and gluconeogenesis in type II diabetes are largely unknown. To examine the involvement of glucocorticoids and the cis-acting insulin response sequence (IRS, -416/-407) in the genetically obese db/db mouse model, we generated crosses between C57BL/KsJ-db/+ mice and transgenic mice that express -460 or -2000 base pairs of the rat PEPCK gene promoter containing an intact or mutated IRS, linked to a reporter gene. Transgenic mice expressing the intact PEPCK(460)-CRP (C-reactive protein) transgene bred to near homozygosity at the db locus were obese, hyperinsulinemic, and developed fasting hyperglycemia (389 +/- 26 mg/100 ml) between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Levels of CRP reporter gene expression were increased 2-fold despite severe hyperinsulinemia compared with non-diabetic non-obese transgenic mice. Reporter gene expression was also increased 2-fold in transgenic obese diabetic db/db mice bearing a mutation in the IRS, -2000(IRS)-hGx, compared with non-obese non-diabetic transgenic 2000(IRS)-hGx mice. Treatment of obese diabetic db/db transgenic mice with the glucocorticoid receptor blocker RU 486 decreased plasma glucose by 50% and reduced PEPCK, GLUT2, glucose-6-phosphatase, tyrosine aminotransferase, CRP, and hGx reporter gene expression to levels similar to those of non-obese normoglycemic transgenic mice. Taken together, these results establish that -460 bp of 5'-flanking sequence is sufficient to mediate the induction of PEPCK gene transcription in genetically obese db/db mice during the development of hyperglycemia. The results further demonstrate that the mechanism underlying increased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the db/db mouse requires the action of glucocorticoids and occurs independently of factors acting through the PEPCK IRS (-416/-407) promoter binding site.

TI  - Deficiency of phosphofructo-1-kinase/muscle subtype in humans impairs insulin secretion and causes insulin resistance.  
AB  - Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is caused by peripheral insulin resistance and impaired beta cell function. Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, and its muscle subtype (PFK1-M) deficiency leads to the autosomal recessively inherited glycogenosis type VII Tarui's disease. It was evaluated whether PFK1-M deficiency leads to alterations in insulin action or secretion in humans. A core family of four members was evaluated for PFK1-M deficiency by DNA and enzyme-activity analyses. All members underwent oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (oGTT and ivGTT) and an insulin-sensitivity test (IST) using octreotide. Enzyme activity determinations in red blood cells showed that the father (46 yr, body mass index [BMI] 22. 4 kg/m2) and older son (19 yr, BMI 17.8 kg/m2) had a homozygous, while the mother (47 yr, BMI 28.4 kg/m2) and younger son (13 yr, BMI 16.5 kg/m2) had a heterozygous PFK1-M deficiency. DNA analyses revealed an exon 5 missense mutation causing missplicing of one allele in all four family members, and an exon 22 frameshift mutation of the other allele of the two homozygously affected individuals. The father showed impaired glucose tolerance, and the mother showed NIDDM. By ivGTT, both parents and the older son had decreased first-phase insulin secretion and a diminished glucose disappearance rate. The IST showed marked insulin resistance in both parents and the older, homozygous son, and moderate resistance in the younger son. PFK1-M deficiency causes impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose, demonstrating its participation in islet glucose metabolism, and peripheral insulin resistance. These combined metabolic sequelae of PFK-1 deficiency identify it as a candidate gene predisposing to NIDDM.

TI  - DNA synthesis of cultured mesothelial cells in a high permeable state.  
AB  - To understand the mechanism of regeneration of the mesothelial cell in a high permeable state, in vitro experiments with cultured mesothelial cells were carried out using a type I collagen-coated multititer plate. Prior to cell seeding, each plate was filled with 100 microL of glucose solution at concentrations of 30 mmol/L, 90 mmol/L, and 150 mmol/L, and minimum essential medium (MEM), respectively. After immersion for one to five weeks at 37 degrees C, mesothelial cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 10(4)/cm2, then glucose was added at varying final concentrations between 0 and 150 mmol/L and/or albumin was added at a final concentration of 2 g/dL. After days 2 and 4, DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). There was no significant difference of DNA synthesis between groups with and without one-week glucose immersion when mesothelial cells were cultured with only 10% FCS/MEM. However, suppression of DNA synthesis at 2 g/dL of albumin was seen no matter what concentration of glucose supplement was used. Without a high concentration of albumin, DNA synthesis was dose-dependent on glucose. The longer the immersion period, the lesser the suppression. It is speculated that process of glycation with collagen may relate to growth of mesothelial cells.

TI  - Cryopreservation of mouse embryos affects later embryonic development possibly through reduced expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1.  
AB  - In order to study the effects of cryopreservation on later embryonic development, two-cell mouse embryos were frozen, thawed, and then allowed to develop into blastocysts. The percentage of cryopreserved embryos which developed into blastocysts was significantly lower than that of fresh two-cell embryos. The amount of glucose incorporation in terms of 3H-2-deoxyglucose uptake in blastocysts developed in vivo, and in vitro from fresh or frozen-thawed two-cell embryos, was 473 +/- 108, 105 +/- 75, and 43.0 +/- 28.3 fmol per embryo per hour, respectively. Quantification of glucose transporter GLUT1 in these embryos by Western blotting was reflective of the degree of glucose incorporation. The implantation rate of blastocysts developed in vitro from frozen-thawed two-cell embryos (22.0%) was significantly lower than that developed in vivo (41.1%). These data suggest that cryopreservation may have later consequences on embryonic development through a mechanism that involves altered GLUT1 expression.

TI  - Dietary fish oil (4 g daily) and cardiovascular risk markers in healthy men.  
AB  - Some epidemiological observations indicate that 1 to 2 weekly servings of fish prevent ischemic heart disease (IHD). This might be explained by an effect of the very-long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 VLCPUFA) of fish oil on lipid metabolism and/or the hemostatic system, both involved in IHD development. We studied the effect of incorporating natural fish oil (4 g daily equivalent to 0.91 g n-3 VLCPUFA and corresponding to one to two weekly servings of fatty fish) into the diet in a 4-week parallel, randomized, and double-blind trial of 47 healthy males aged 29 to 60 years. Sunflower oil was used as placebo. The fish oil had no significant effect on plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), blood coagulation FVII, fibrinogen, endogenous fibrinolysis, beta-thromboglobulin, von Willebrand factor, glucose, or insulin in fasting blood samples. In nonfasting samples (n = 19), fish oil was associated with an approximately 30% decline in plasma triglycerides (P < .02) and a 9% decline in FVII protein (P < .05), whereas FVII coagulant activity and fibrinolysis were unaffected. In conclusion, our findings indicate that lowering of postprandial triglycerides is the only n-3 VLCPUFA effect that could contribute to primary prevention of IHD in healthy middle-aged men as assessed by currently measurable lipid and hemostatic risk markers.

TI  - Production of testosterone from cholesterol using a single-step microbial transformation of Mycobacterium sp.  
AB  - A novel single-step microbial transformation process for the production of testosterone (TS) from cholesterol by Mycobacterium sp was investigated. It was found that the supply of reducing power, NADH, from the metabolism of glucose was necessary for the reduction of androst-4-en-3,17-dione (AD) to TS. The cultivation time for the maximum accumulation of TS and the residual glucose increased in parallel with the amount of glucose supplemented in fermentation cultures. After the glucose in the fermentation culture was completely consumed, most of the TS was oxidized to AD. Adding a larger amount of glucose could prevent oxidation of TS to AD. Under optimal fermentation conditions, the maximum molar conversion rate of TS from cholesterol was 51% in a 5-L surface-aerated fermentor after 120 h cultivation.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta is sequestered into an inactive pool by lipoproteins.  
AB  - Elevated plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) have been correlated with the development of atherosclerosis. These lipoproteins may promote atherogenesis by direct deposition of lipid in the vessel wall. In addition, previous data suggested that there was an inverse correlation between serum LDL-cholesterol concentration and the proportion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in an active form (Grainger et al. 1995. Nature Med. 1:74). Here we have investigated whether lipoproteins can affect the activity of TGF-beta1 in plasma and show that TGF-beta can associate with the lipoprotein fraction. In the plasma of healthy males, 16 +/- 5% (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 57) of the total plasma TGF-beta1 was associated with the lipoprotein fraction, with the major proportion (64 +/- 15%) in the HDL-3 subfraction. However, in ten diabetic subjects with moderately poor glucose control (Hb alc > 8.0), the proportion of total plasma TGF-beta in the lipoprotein fraction was 68 +/- 21%. This large increase in TGF-beta1 associated with the lipoprotein fraction was mainly due to association with VLDL, chylomicrons, and LDL. The lipoprotein fraction inhibits TGF-beta1 binding to the type II TGF-beta receptor extracellular domain in an ELISA and inhibits TGF-beta1 activity in the mink lung cell bioassay. We propose that sequestration of TGF-beta into lipoproteins represents a novel mechanism by which TGF-beta activity in circulation may be regulated. Lipoprotein sequestration of TGF-beta may therefore contribute to the severe depression of TGF-beta activity in advanced atherosclerosis.

TI  - Escherichia coli is unable to produce pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ).  
AB  - Many bacteria can synthesize the cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a cofactor of several dehydrogenases, including glucose dehydrogenase (GCD). Among the enteric bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been shown to contain the genes required for PQQ biosynthesis. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were thought to be unable to synthesize PQQ but it has been reported that strain EF260, a derivative of E. coli FB8, can synthesize PQQ after mutation and can oxidize glucose to gluconate via the GCD/PQQ pathway (F. Biville, E. Turlin & F. Gasser, 1991, J Gen Microbiol 137, 1775-1782). We have re-investigated this claim and conclude that it is most likely erroneous. (i) Strain EF260, isolated originally by Biville and coworkers, was unable to synthesize a holo-enzyme GCD unless PQQ was supplied to the growth medium. No GCD activity could be detected in membrane fractions. (ii) The amount of PQQ detected in the growth medium of EF260 was very low and not very different from that found in a medium with its parent strain or in a medium containing no cells. (iii) EF260 cells were unable to produce gluconate from glucose via the PQQ/GCD pathway. (iv) Introduction of a gcd::Cm deletion in EF260, eliminating GCD, did not affect glucose metabolism. This suggested a pathway for glucose metabolism other than the PQQ/GCD pathway. (v) Glucose uptake and metabolism in EF260 involved a low-affinity transport system of unknown identity, followed most likely by phosphorylation via glucokinase. It is concluded that E. coli cannot synthesize PQQ and that it lacks genes required for PQQ biosynthesis.

TI  - Aspartame ingestion increases urinary calcium, but not oxalate excretion, in healthy subjects [see comments]  
AB  - Aspartame is the artificial sweetener most extensively used as a substitute for glucose or sucrose in the food industry, particularly in soft drinks. As glucose ingestion increases calciuria and oxaluria, the two main determinants of urinary calcium-oxalate saturation, we considered it worthwhile to determine whether aspartame ingestion also affects calcium-oxalate metabolism. Our study compares the effects of the ingestion of similarly sweet doses of aspartame (250 mg) and glucose (75 g) on calcium and oxalate metabolisms of seven healthy subjects. Urinary calcium excretion increased after the intake of both aspartame (+86%; P < 0.01) and glucose (+124%; P < 0.01). This may be due to the rise in calcemia observed after both aspartame (+2.2%; P < 0.05) and glucose ingestion (+1.8%; P < 0.05). The increased calcemia may be linked to the decrease in phosphatemia that occurred after both aspartame (P < 0.01) and glucose (P < 0.01) load. Aspartame did not alter glycemia or insulinemia, whereas glucose intake caused striking increases in both glycemia (+59%; P < 0.001) and insulinemia (+869%; P < 0.01). Although insulin was considered the main calciuria-induced factor after glucose load, it is unlikely that this mechanism played a role with aspartame. Urinary oxalate excretion did not change after aspartame, whereas it increased (+27%; P < 0.05) after glucose load. Thus, as aspartame induced a similar increase in calciuria as did glucose but, conversely, no change in oxaluria, substituting glucose by aspartame in soft drinks may appear to be of some potential benefit.

TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate prevents the decline in hepatic ATP and energy charge after ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a high-energy metabolite in the final step of glycolysis. PEP is converted into pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. One molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is generated from one molecule of PEP. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of PEP on hepatic energy metabolism at an early phase after ischemia and reperfusion were examined in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (250-350 g) were divided into two groups; after two 15-min periods of ischemia with 2 min reperfusion in between, either PEP or glucose solution (400 mmol/liter, pH 7.4) was infused into the portal vein (2.5 ml/300 g body wt/5 min). Before and 0, 5, 10, and 30 min after ischemia, arterial blood and liver tissue were collected for analyses. RESULTS: During the two ischemic periods, ATP and total adenine nucleotide (TAN) of the liver decreased from 9.10 +/- 0.50 and 14.06 +/- 0.29 to 0.99 +/- 0.50 and 10.86 +/- 0.42 mmole/g liver, respectively (P < 0.05), while adenosine monophosphate (AMP) increased from 1.18 +/- 0.15 to 8.47 +/- 0.66 mmole/g liver (P < 0. 05). Hepatic energy charge (EC) significantly decreased from 0.78 +/- 0.02 to 0.16 +/- 0.03 (P < 0.05). Serum concentrations of pyruvate and lactate were elevated from 1.18 +/- 0.15 and 18.4 +/- 0. 52 to 3.29 +/- 0.52 and 72.6 +/- 4.8 mg/dl, respectively (P < 0.05). After a 5-min infusion of PEP or glucose solution, the ATP concentration was significantly higher in the PEP group than in the glucose group (4.08 +/- 0.58 micromole/g liver vs 2.20 +/- 0.45 micromole/g liver, P < 0.01), whereas AMP concentration was significantly lower in the PEP group than in the glucose group (4.26 +/- 0.66 micromole/g liver vs 7.02 +/- 0.71 micromole/g liver, P < 0. 01). EC in the PEP group was significantly higher than that in the glucose group (0.493 +/- 0.051 vs 0.293 +/- 0.042, P < 0.01). Ten minutes after ischemia, the ATP, TAN, and EC levels were still higher in the PEP group than in the glucose group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. At 30 min after ischemia, these values became similar in both groups. At 5, 10, and 30 min after ischemia, serum pyruvate concentrations were higher in the PEP group than in the glucose group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PEP recovers hepatic energy from liver cell damage at an early phase after ischemia and reperfusion by prompt ATP production through the degradation of PEP into pyruvate in the liver.

TI  - The effect of norepinephrine on insulin secretion and glucose effectiveness in non-insulin-dependent diabetes.  
AB  - It has previously been shown that in normal subjects, physiological elevation of norepinephrine (NE) impairs insulin sensitivity (Si) but does not influence insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of short-term physiological elevation of NE on insulin secretion, Si, and glucose-mediated glucose disposal, or the glucose effectiveness index (Sg), in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Two intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed in eight well-controlled NIDDM patients, using a supplemental exogenous insulin infusion to achieve an approximation of normal endogenous insulin secretion. The IVGTTs were performed in random order after 30 minutes of either the saline (SAL) or NE (25 ng/kg/min) infusions, which were continued throughout the 3-hour IVGTT. Sg and Si were estimated by minimal model analysis of the IVGTT data as previously described. Plasma C-peptide was used to estimate insulin secretion rate using the ISEC program. NE infusion produced approximately a threefold increase in plasma NE, associated with (1) a significant reduction in glucose disposal ([KG] SAL v NE, 0.73 +/- 0.06 v 0.61 +/- 0.06 x 10(-2).min-1, P < .05), (2) no reduction in Si (2.33 +/- 0.8 v 2.62 +/- 0.9 x 10(-4).min-1/mU/L, NS), (3) a reduced mean second-phase insulin secretion rate (1.21 +/- 0.19 v 1.01 +/- 0.16 x 10(-3) pmol/kg/min per mmol/L glucose, P < .05), (4) a significant increase in Sg (0.89 +/- 0.08 v 1.63 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2).min-1, P < .05), and (5) a corresponding increase in glucose effectiveness at zero insulin ([GEZI] 0.55 +/- 0.13 v 1.30 +/- 0.33 x 10(-2).min-1, P < .05). These results show that in contrast to normal subjects, physiological elevation of NE in NIDDM does not result in a reduction in Si, but causes a reduction in glucose disposal related to inhibition of insulin secretion that is only partially compensated for by increased Sg.

TI  - [Insulin resistance among relatives of patients with NIDDM. Significance of physical fitness and muscle metabolism]  
AB  - To explore the possible role of a reduced physical fitness for the diminished insulin sensitivity in first-degree relatives of NIDDM patients, 21 relatives and 22 matched control subjects were examined employing a hyperinsulinaemic (insulin infusion rate 0.6 mU/kg/min) euglycaemic clamp combined with the isotope dilution technique (3-3H-glucose), the forearm technique and indirect calorimetry.  During hyperinsulinaemia glucose disposal (Rd) was significantly diminished in the relatives (p < 0.01). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) was 15% lower in the relatives than in the controls (p = 0.03). There was a highly significant correlation between Rd and VO2 max in both groups. In multiple linear regression analyses with Rd as the dependent variable VO2 max significantly determined the level of Rd (p < 0.01), whereas forearm blood flow and anthropometric data did not. We concluded that the insulin resistance in healthyfirst degree relatives of patients with NIDDM is associated with a diminished physical work capacity. Whether this finding is ascribable to environmental or genetic factors remains to be determined.

TI  - Yeast gene YOR137c is involved in the activation of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase by glucose.  
AB  - Glucose triggers transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that increase the level and activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane H+-ATPase. We have studied the post-transcriptional activation of the enzyme by glucose and have found that the YOR137c gene product is implicated in this activation. Deletion of YOR137c does not affect the level of Pma1 at the plasma membrane, but disturbs the glucose-triggered Vmax increase of the enzyme. We propose that at least two independent mechanisms are involved in glucose activation of the H+-ATPase.

TI  - Cardiolipin is not essential for the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources.  
AB  - Cardiolipin is a unique dimeric phospholipid, which is present throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and is specifically localized in mitochondrial membranes. It is widely believed that mitochondria possess an essential requirement for this phospholipid. To determine whether cardiolipin is essential for yeast growth, we generated a cardiolipin synthase null mutant by disrupting the CLS1 gene (open reading frame YDL142c on chromosome IV) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Biochemical analysis of the mutant indicated that it had no cardiolipin synthase activity and no cardiolipin in its membranes. The enzyme phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase, which catalyses the committed step of the cardiolipin pathway, remained unaffected in the null mutant. Haploid cells containing the null allele are viable in media containing glucose, galactose or glycerol/ethanol as the sole carbon source, although growth in galactose or glycerol/ethanol is somewhat reduced in the mutant compared with the wild type. These results indicate that cardiolipin is not essential for the growth of S. cerevisiae in fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources.

TI  - II. Functional consequences of intragastrically administered ethanol in rats as measured by the 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method: the contribution of dopamine.  
AB  - As outlined in the companion paper, many of the changes in functional activity produced by acute intragastric ethanol administration as determined by the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method occur in structures of the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine circuits. In this study, a dopaminergic antagonist, flupenthixol, was used to determine the contribution of dopamine to the ethanol-induced increases in functional activity. To assess the ability of flupenthixol to block dopaminergic-induced increases in glucose utilization, it was first examined in conjunction with the indirect dopaminergic agonist methylphenidate. Pretreatment with flupenthixol significantly reduced methylphenidate-induced increases in glucose utilization in structures of the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine circuits. These findings indicate that this is an effective strategy for the determination of the neurochemical contributions to the changes in CNS functional activity. Flupenthixol pretreatment blocked many of the ethanol-induced increases in glucose utilization at the 0.25 g/kg dose, particularly in mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal structures. At the 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg ethanol doses, however, pretreatment with flupenthixol did not reverse the increases in glucose utilization in several brain regions, suggesting that dopaminergic activity is not responsible for the observed increases in glucose utilization and further, that these increases involve other neurotransmitter systems. In some regions, however, flupenthixol pretreatment resulted in augmented levels of glucose utilization above those rates produced by the administration of higher doses of ethanol alone. These findings suggest that the contribution of dopamine to the increases in functional activity are more complex at higher doses of ethanol.

Together, these findings provide direct evidence, for the first time, that the Rho subfamily of GTPases plays a key regulatory role(s) in insulin secretion, and they suggest that Cdc42 may be required for early steps in glucose stimulation of insulin release, whereas Rap and/or Rac may be required for a later step(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling cascade (i.e. Ca2+-induced exocytosis of insulin).

TI  - Evidence for differential roles of the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins in glucose- and calcium-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.  
AB  - We utilized clostridial toxins (with known specificities for inhibition of GTPases) to ascertain the contribution of candidate GTPases in physiologic insulin secretion from beta cells. Exposure of normal rat islets or isolated beta (HIT-T15) cells to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B catalyzed the glucosylation (and thereby the inactivation) of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho endogenous to beta cells; concomitantly, either toxin reduced glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion from rat islets and HIT cells. Treatment of beta cells with Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (LT; which modified only Ras, Rap, and Rac) also reduced glucose- or potassium-induced secretion. However, clostridial toxin C3-exoenzyme (which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates only Rho) was without any effect on either glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion. These data suggest that Cdc42, Rac, Ras, and/or Rap (but not Rho) may be needed for glucose- or potassium-mediated secretion. The effects of these toxins appear to be specific on stimulus-secretion coupling, since no difference in metabolic viability (assessed colorimetrically by quantitating the conversion of the tetrazolium salt into a formazan in a reduction reaction driven by nutrient metabolism) was demonstrable between control and toxin (A or LT)-treated beta cells. Toxin (A or LT) treatment also did not alter glucose- or potassium-mediated rises in cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), suggesting that these GTPases are involved in steps distal to elevations in [Ca2+]i. Recent findings indicate that the carboxyl methylation of Cdc42 is stimulated by only glucose, whereas that of Rap (Kowluru et al., J Clin Invest 98: 540-555, 1996) and Rac (present study) are regulated by glucose or potassium. Together, these findings provide direct evidence, for the first time, that the Rho subfamily of GTPases plays a key regulatory role(s) in insulin secretion, and they suggest that Cdc42 may be required for early steps in glucose stimulation of insulin release, whereas Rap and/or Rac may be required for a later step(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling cascade (i.e. Ca2+-induced exocytosis of insulin).

TI  - Bitter taste of monosaccharide pentaacetate esters.  
AB  - The pentaacetate esters of several, but not all, monosaccharides were recently found to stimulate insulin release from rat pancreatic islets. We have now compared the taste of solutions of either these esters or the corresponding unesterified monosaccharides. The sweet taste of the latter monosaccharides (0.22 M) ranged as follows: D-glucose approximately or = D-galactose approximately or = D-mannoheptulose > L-glucose. None of the esters (1.7 mM) displayed a sweet taste. However, the alpha- and beta-anomer of D-glucose pentaacetate, the alpha-anomer of D-mannose pentaacetate and the beta-anomer of L-glucose pentaacetate all displayed a bitter taste, whilst both alpha- and beta-D-galactose pentaacetate yielded doubtful results. Since such a situation is comparable to that characterizing the islet B-cell response to these esters, it is proposed that the intracellular interaction between the esters or their hydrolytic products and a protein involved in the recognition of bitter taste in taste buds may participate in their insulinotropic action.

TI  - Hyperinsulinemia, circadian variation of blood pressure and end-organ damage in hypertension.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with essential hypertension display hyperinsulinemia and/or insulin resistance. A relationship between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure has not been conclusively established. Some evidence points to a relationship between hyperinsulinemia and evidence of cardiovascular damage. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined the relationship between insulin secretion in response to an oral glucose load, circadian variation of blood pressure, and evidence of vascular damage, measured by the thickness of the carotid artery and urinary albumin excretion. DESIGN: Seventy patients with essential hypertension and 35 healthy volunteers were included in the study. RESULTS: Twenty patients were hyperinsulinemic. Office blood pressure was not different between hypertensive patients with high and those with normal insulin AUC. However, night-time diastolic blood pressure was greater in hypertensive patients with high insulin AUC (93 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) than in those with normal insulin AUC (83.5 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, P < 0.005). The thickness of the carotid artery and urinary albumin excretion were greater (P < 0.05) in patients with high insulin AUC than in patients with normal insulin AUC and normotensive subjects. Insulin AUC was significantly correlated with ambulatory blood pressure, carotid artery thickness, and urine albumin excretion. Multiple regression analysis using insulin AUC as the dependent variable and UAE, triglycerides, body-mass index and office or ambulatory blood pressure as independent variables showed the strongest correlation with urine albumin excretion (P < 0.0001), triglycerides (P < 0.02) and body-mass index (P < 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in patients with essential hypertension hyperinsulinemia is associated with higher levels of nocturnal blood pressure, and greater evidence of vascular damage.

TI  - Std1, a gene involved in glucose transport in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  
AB  - A wild-type strain, Sp972 h-, of Schizosaccharomyces pombe was mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG)-resistant mutants were isolated. Out of 300 independent 2-DOG-resistant mutants, 2 failed to grow on glucose and fructose (mutants 3/8 and 3/23); however, their hexokinase activity was normal. They have been characterized as defective in their sugar transport properties, and the mutations have been designated as std1-8 and std1-23 (sugar transport defective). The mutations are allelic and segregate as part of a single gene when the mutants carrying them are crossed to a wild-type strain. We confirmed the transport deficiency of these mutants by [14C]glucose uptake. They also fail to grow on other monosaccharides, such as fructose, mannose, and xylulose, as well as disaccharides, such as sucrose and maltose, unlike the wild-type strain. Lack of growth of the glucose transport-deficient mutants on maltose revealed the extracellular breakdown of maltose in S. pombe, unlike in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both of the mutants are unable to grow on low concentrations of glucose (10 to 20 mM), while one of them, 3/23, grows on high concentrations (50 to 100 mM) as if altered in its affinity for glucose. This mutant (3/23) shows a lag period of 12 to 18 h when grown on high concentrations of glucose. The lag disappears when the culture is transferred from the log phase of its growth on high concentrations. These mutants complement phenotypically similar sugar transport mutants (YGS4 and YGS5) reported earlier by Milbradt and Hoefer (Microbiology 140:2617-2623, 1994), and the clone complementing YGS4 and YGS5 was identified as the only glucose transporter in fission yeast having 12 transmembrane domains. These mutants also demonstrate two other defects: lack of induction and repression of shunt pathway enzymes and defective mating.

TI  - Effect of ouabain on insulin secretion in the amphibian pancreas.  
AB  - We investigated the influence of ouabain on glucose-induced insulin release from toad pancreatic minces in the same nanomolar range as that of an ouabain-like compound found in human blood. Ouabain increased insulin secretion at basal (2 mM), but not maximally stimulatory (8 mM), glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner up to an optimal concentration of 1 nM, with the values declining progressively thereafter. Ouabain at 3 nM changed the shape of the overall dose-response curve for glucose from sigmoidal to hyperbolic and displaced the optimal insulinotropic glucose concentration from 8 to 2 mM. Preincubation with ouabain (3 nM) followed by glycoside washout potentiated insulin induction at 2 mM, but not at 8 mM glucose, but this same pretreatment followed by incubation in Ca(2+)-free medium depressed insulin release under all conditions, and especially at high glucose; here, however, the preexposure to ouabain partially prevented the drop in insulin secretion at 8 mM glucose. Acetylcholine at 8 microM augmented insulin release at both levels of glucose, and ouabain potentiated this effect synergistically at high, but not low glucose. Ouabain, at physiologic concentrations, thus appears to regulate the effect of secretagogues such as glucose and acetylcholine in amphibians.

TI  - Comparison of the serum insulin and endothelin level in patients with essential and renovascular hypertension.  
AB  - To evaluate whether a relationship exists between insulinaemia (increased in essential hypertension) and endothelin level, we determined insulin and endothelin-1-like (ET-1-Li) immunoreactivity in blood serum by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in essential (EH, n = 64) and renovascular (RVH, n = 36) patients with hypertension and in healthy subjects (controls, n = 44). The trials were carried out in fasting patients and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 75 g). Each group of subjects had similar body mass index (BMI) values. The mean values of insulin level were significantly (P < 0.0001 in every case) elevated in patients with essential hypertension compared with renovascular and control subjects during the whole OGTT. There was no significant difference in insulin level between subjects with renovascular hypertension and controls. ET-1-Li immunoreactivity levels were significantly increased (P < 0.005 fasting; P < 0.01 after 1 and 2 h) throughout the whole test in the essential hypertensive group compared with controls; in renovascular hypertensive patients 2 h after glucose administration the analogous difference was not statistically significant (P < 0.05 fasting; P < 0.01 after 1 h). In all the investigated groups the mean value of ET-1-Li immunoreactivity increased and decreased in parallel to the changes in insulin concentration during the OGTT. The ET-1-Li level was positively correlated with insulin concentration with a statistical significance for patients with essential hypertension 1 h after load (r = 0.6578, P < 0.05). The border of the significance level correlation was obtained in essential hypertensive patients 2 h after load (r = 0.5227, P = 0.06) and in controls 1 h after glucose administration (r = 0.5465, P = 0.054). Our results indicate a mutual connection between insulinaemia and an endothelin set; their relevance for the pathogenesis of hypertension requires further research.

TI  - A minimum of fuel is necessary for tolbutamide to mimic the effects of glucose on electrical activity in pancreatic beta-cells.  
AB  - Glucose stimulation of pancreatic beta-cells triggers electrical activity (slow waves of membrane potential with superimposed spikes) that is best monitored with intracellular microelectrodes. Closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels underlies the depolarization to the threshold potential and participates in the increase in electrical activity produced by suprathreshold (>7 mM) concentrations of glucose, but it is still unclear whether this is the sole mechanism of control. This was investigated by testing whether blockade of ATP-sensitive K+ channels by low concentrations of tolbutamide is able to mimic the effects of glucose on mouse beta-cell electrical activity even in the absence of the sugar. The response to tolbutamide was influenced by the duration of the perifusion with the low glucose medium. Tolbutamide (25 microM) caused a rapid and sustained depolarization with continuous activity after 6 min of perifusion of the islet with 3 mM glucose, and a progressive depolarization with slow waves of the membrane potential after 20 min. In the absence of glucose, the beta-cell response to tolbutamide was a transient phase of depolarization with rare slow waves (6 min) or a silent, small, but sustained, depolarization (20 min). Readministration of 3 mM glucose was sufficient to restore slow waves, whereas an increase in the glucose concentration to 5 and 7 mM was followed by a lengthening of the slow waves and a shortening of the intervals. In contrast, induction of slow waves by tolbutamide proved very difficult in the absence of glucose, because the beta-cell membrane tended to depolarize from a silent level to the plateau level, at which electrical activity is continuous. Azide, a mitochondrial poison, abrogated the electrical activity induced by tolbutamide in the absence of glucose, which demonstrates the influence of the metabolism of endogenous fuels on the response to the sulfonylurea. The partial repolarization that azide also produced was reversed by increasing the concentration of tolbutamide, but reappearance of the spikes required the addition of glucose. It is concluded that inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels is not the only mechanism by which glucose controls electrical activity in beta-cells.

TI  - The role of thiamine in Yersinia kristensenii resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals.  
AB  - The resistance to divalent metal ions, antibiotics and H2O2 was investigated in Yersinia kristensenii strains 13, 15, 18 by performing subcultivations with CdSO4 (20 and 100 mg/L) in nutrient agar (NA) and M9 medium with thiamine. Metal resistance of all three strains in NA was the same and decreased in the following sequence: Ni > Zn = Co > Cd. The chloramphenicol (Cmp) resistance ranged between 32 and 256 mg/L and the H2O2 sensitivity was very low or even zero. In the presence of thiamine the metal resistance sequence changed to Zn = Cd > Ni, Co, Ni and Co tolerance being 10-20 mg/L. Cmp resistance of all strains increased to 256 mg/L and H2O2 sensitivity also rose. In Cd-treated cultures, the ratio of glucose to thiamine in culture medium affected Cd resistance. At normal content of glucose and thiamine (5 g/L and 5 mg/L), Cd resistance markedly decreased coincident with thiamine exhaustion in these slowly-growing cultures. The Cmp resistance decreased to 16 mg/L, Ni and Co intolerance and H2O2 hypersensitivity appeared. At lowered glucose or thiamine levels (5 g/L and 2.5 mg/L or 2.5 g/L and 5 mg/L) a marginal decrease of Cd resistance took place in response to limited glucose uptake. Low thiamine or low-glucose cultures were resistant to H2O2, and exhibited a small decrease in Cmp resistance and a low Ni, Co tolerance. The adaptation of strain 15 to Cd induced only a small decrease of Cd resistance. Lowered glucose-to-thiamine ratio in culture medium probably induced in Cd-treated cultures a response triggering Cd resistance.

TI  - Insulin mediates glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I by pancreatic beta cells. An insulin-receptor mechanism for autoregulation of protein synthesis by translation.  
AB  - Although glucose regulates the biosynthesis of a variety of beta cell proteins at the level of translation, the mechanism responsible for this effect is unknown. We demonstrate that incubation of pancreatic islets with elevated glucose levels results in rapid and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of PHAS-I, an inhibitor of mRNA cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E. Our initial approach was to determine if this effect is mediated by the metabolism of glucose and activation of islet cell protein kinases, or whether insulin secreted from the beta cell stimulates phosphorylation of PHAS-I via an insulin-receptor mechanism as described for insulin-sensitive cells. In support of the latter mechanism, inhibitors of islet cell protein kinases A and C exert no effect on glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, and theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, promote marked dephosphorylation of PHAS-I. In addition, exogenous insulin and endogenous insulin secreted by the beta cell line, betaTC6-F7, increase phosphorylation of PHAS-I, suggesting that beta cells of the islet, in part, mediate this effect. Studies with beta cell lines and islets indicate that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, and amino acids alone dose-dependently stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, which is further enhanced by insulin. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibits by approximately 62% the increase in total protein synthesis stimulated by high glucose concentrations. These results indicate that glucose stimulates PHAS-I phosphorylation via insulin interacting with its own receptor on the beta cell which may serve as an important mechanism for autoregulation of protein synthesis by translation.

The ovine fetus is shown to be resistant to insulin-induced suppression of proteolysis, relative to the adult. Data from studies in the human premature infant show that the findings in the ovine fetus are similar to those in the ex utero premature human.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor II inhibits glucose-induced insulin exocytosis.  
AB  - We have investigated the effect of IGF-II on glucose-induced insulin release in the pancreatic beta-cell. Introduction of IGF-II during perifusion of the cells with 20 mM glucose abolished glucose-induced insulin release. Concomitant addition of IGF-II with 20 mM glucose caused a complete inhibition of insulin release. In addition, IGF-II inhibited Ca(2+)-induced insulin release from electropermeabilized pancreatic beta-cells. IGF-II had no effect on K(+)-or tolbutamide-induced insulin release. However, IGF-II could suppress K(+)-stimulated insulin release when cells were pretreated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. The inhibitory effect of IGF-II on insulin release was not associated with significant changes in membrane potential, activity of the voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+)-channel or cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin or the phorbol ester TPA abolished the inhibitory action of IGF-II on insulin release. Hence, the molecular mechanism whereby activation of the IGF-II/M6P receptor by IGF-II inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis in the pancreatic beta-cell involves pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and is dependent on PKC activity.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate use of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-(fluorine-18) fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in detection of chronic osteomyelitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients suspected to have chronic osteomyelitis in the peripheral (n = 21) or central (n = 10) skeleton were evaluated prospectively with FDG PET. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve was performed. The final diagnosis was made by means of bacteriologic culture of surgical specimens and histopathologic analysis. RESULTS: FDG PET allowed identification of 17 of 18 patients with osteomyelitis and 12 of 13 without osteomyelitis. There was one false-positive and one equivocal result. The area under the ROC curve was 0.96 for all patients, 1.00 for patients suspected to have osteomyelitis in the peripheral skeleton, and 0.88 for patients suspected to have osteomyelitis in the central skeleton. The overall accuracy of FDG PET was 97% with a high degree of interobserver concordance (kappa = 0.93). The overall sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FDG PET enables noninvasive detection and demonstration of the extent of chronic osteomyelitis with a high degree of accuracy. Especially in the central skeleton within active bone marrow, FDG PET is highly accurate and shows great promise in diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), glucose intolerance (GI) and macrosomia in a Latin Mexican population, using the one-step procedure proposed by the World Health Organization. METHOD: Consecutive pregnant women (n = 667) who attended the antenatal clinic and delivered at the hospital were recruited after 24 weeks of gestation, mean 34.2 weeks, range 24-40 weeks. After a minimum of 3 days with a 150-g carbohydrate diet, a glucose load of 75 g was administered and 2 h after, a blood sample for glucose was taken, plasma was separated and immediately processed for glucose, using a glucose-oxidase method. RESULTS: Twenty women were diagnosed with GDM (3%), 87 had GI (13%) and 560 had a normal glucose response (84%). Macrosomia occurred in two (10%) of GDM, in nine (10.3%) of GI, and in 29 (5.4%) gravidas with a normal response, respectively. Only one of the macrosomic infants whose mother had GI, had neonatal hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of glucose abnormalities during pregnancy was 16%. GI in this group was associated to macrosomia at the same rate as GDM.

METHODS: In this study, 93 women were enrolled into four groups.: 1) self-mixed/syringe, 2) premixed/syringe, 3) self-mixed/pen, and 4) premixed/pen. RESULTS: Women in the premixed pen group had significantly less cesarean deliveries for failure to progress in labor and a decrease (not significant) in postpartum infection and infant macrosomia. Patients felt premixed insulin administered by the pen was easier to use. No significant differences were noted in glucose control, compliance among the four groups, or cost. CONCLUSION: Premixed insulin administration via the pen is safe, effective and no more costly than traditional treatment for pregnant diabetic women.

In order to elucidate these metabolic events further, we studied 12 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse (10 patients) or nodular (two patients) toxic goitre (ten women, two men; age 42.8 +/- 3.2 yr; BMI: 21.6 +/- 0.7 kg/m2) before ("TOX") and after ("TRE") 11.2 +/- 1.0 weeks treatment with methimazole and compared these patients to a control group ("CTR") of 11 subjects (nine women, two men; age 40.5 +/- 3.9 yr; BMI 22.5 +/- 1.0 kg/m2). All were studied for three hours in the basal state, using indirect calorimetry, isotope dilution for measurement of glucose turnover and the forearm technique for assessment of muscle metabolism. Prior to treatment patients with thyrotoxicosis were characterized by: Increased (p < 0.05) levels of T3 (3.75 +/- 0.23 [TOX], 1.89 +/- 0.08 [TRE] and 1.75 +/- 0.11 [CTR] nmol/l), resting energy expenditure (130.5 +/- 3.5 [TOX], 107.7 +/- 2.7 [TRE] and 106.3 +/- 3.1 [CTR] percent of predicted), protein oxidation (0.67 +/- 0.03 [TOX], 0.54 +/- 0.06 [TRE] and 0.46 +/- 0.05 [CTR] mg/kg/min), lipid oxidation (1.34 +/- 0.08 [TOX], 1.00 +/- 0.06 [TRE] and 1.02 +/- 0.04 [CTR] mg/kg/min), endogenous glucose production (2.51 +/- 0.13 [TOX], 1.86 +/- 0.12 [TRE] and 1.85 +/- 0.12 [CTR] mg/kg/min), non-oxidative glucose turnover (1.28 +/- 0.16 [TOX], 0.75 +/- 0.18 [TRE] and 0.71 +/- 0.11 [CTR] mg/kg/min) and a 50% increase in total forearm blood flow. Glucose oxidation (1.23 +/- 0.09 [TOX], 1.13 +/- 0.10 [TRE] and 1.13 +/- 0.09 [CTR] mg/kg/min), exchange of substrates in the muscles of the forearm and circulating levels of insulin, C-peptide, growth hormone or glucagon were not influenced by hyperthyroidism. Propranolol (20 mg thrice daily) given to seven of the patients for two days did not affect circulating levels of thyroid hormones, energy expenditure or glucose turnover rates. These results suggest that all major fuel sources contribute to the hypermetabolism of thyrotoxicosis and that augmented non-oxidative glucose metabolism may further aggravate the condition. All abnormalities recede with medical treatment of the disease.

TI  - On-line, continuous measurement of extracellular striatal glucose using microdialysis sampling and electrochemical detection.  
AB  - A sensitive, enzymatic glucose electrode was coupled with the microdialysis sampling technique to enable the continuous, on-line measurement of dialysate glucose. The glucose sensitive electrode was fabricated by immobilizing glucose oxidase onto the surface of an osmium-polyvinylpyrridine horse radish peroxidase gel (Os-gel-HRP) which had been cast coated onto a glassy carbon electrode. This 'bilayer' electrode generated a reductive current to glucose at a potential of 0 mV thereby minimizing faradic oxidative interferences. The system utilized the continuous mixing of two fluids immediately prior to the 'bilayer' electrode. One fluid was the dialysate. The other was an oxygenated, low pH phosphate buffer which minimized oxidative interference, buffered the electrode from variations of pH and maximized enzyme efficiency. In practical terms, the 'bilayer' electrode was simple to manufacture, quick to reach stable basal currents (less than 60 min), sensitive (2.5 microM glucose could be detected in the dialysate) and durable (usable for up to 3 days). In vivo experiments, used the smallest commercially available microdialysis probes to demonstrate that on-line, continuous measurements of EC striatal glucose in the dialysate were receptive to pharmacological (local perfusion with veratridine (50 microM), systemic hyperglycemia (1.5 ml of 0.55 M glucose intraperitoneal (i.p.)) and anesthesia (Nembutal 40 mg/kg i.p.)) and behavioral (restraint) manipulations. This technique allows for greater temporal resolution than conventional HPLC procedures whilst requiring significantly less technical outlay or analytical expertise. The high sensitivity of the analytical technique could facilitate the study of EC glucose levels in very localized regions of the brain if coupled to microdialysis probes of small dimensions.

TI  - Net hepatic glucose output is normal on postoperative day 1 after liver transplantation.  
AB  - The liver plays a central role in carbohydrate metabolism and glucose homeostasis; therefore, the rapid recovery of glucose homeostasis after liver transplantation (LT) is important. The purpose of this study was to evaluate hepatic and whole-body glucose production (WBGP) on postoperative day 1 after LT using a combination of arteriovenous differences and radioisotope techniques. Two groups of female commercially bred pigs with an average body weight of 31.9 +/- 1.4 kg were studied. A control group (n = 6) underwent laparotomy. A transplanted group (n = 6) was submitted to LT. All pigs were instrumented with catheters placed in the carotid artery and the hepatic, portal, and jugular vein, and flow probes were placed around the hepatic artery and portal vein. WBGP was measured by a primed constant infusion of 3-[3H]glucose 1 day postoperatively.  Plasma glucose was 89 +/- 6 versus 98 +/- 7 mg/dL in the control and transplanted groups, respectively. WBGP was increased by 42 per cent in the transplanted group (2.54 +/- 0.17 vs 3.62 +/- 0.39 mg/kg.min), but the net hepatic glucose output was not different between the control and the transplanted groups (1.53 +/- 0.28 vs 1.68 +/- 0.31 mg/kg.min). These results demonstrate that net hepatic glucose output was not different between the control and transplanted pigs, suggesting that LT does not compromise the ability of the liver to produce glucose. However, the WBGP was increased by 42 per cent in the transplanted group, suggesting either a significant contribution from another organ or a significant intrahepatic utilization of glucose.

TI  - The mechanism of regulation of hexokinase: new insights from the crystal structure of recombinant human brain hexokinase complexed with glucose and glucose-6-phosphate.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hexokinase I is the pacemaker of glycolysis in brain tissue. The type I isozyme exhibits unique regulatory properties in that physiological levels of phosphate relieve potent inhibition by the product, glucose-6-phosphate (Gluc-6-P). The 100 kDa polypeptide chain of hexokinase I consists of a C-terminal (catalytic) domain and an N-terminal (regulatory) domain. Structures of ligated hexokinase I should provide a basis for understanding mechanisms of catalysis and regulation at an atomic level. RESULTS: The complex of human hexokinase I with glucose and Gluc-6-P (determined to 2.8 A resolution) is a dimer with twofold molecular symmetry. The N- and C-terminal domains of one monomer interact with the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively, of the symmetry-related monomer. The two domains of a monomer are connected by a single alpha helix and each have the fold of yeast hexokinase. Salt links between a possible cation-binding loop of the N-terminal domain and a loop of the C-terminal domain may be important to regulation. Each domain binds single glucose and Gluc-6-P molecules in proximity to each other. The 6-phosphoryl group of bound Gluc-6-P at the C-terminal domain occupies the putative binding site for ATP, whereas the 6-phosphoryl group at the N-terminal domain may overlap the binding site for phosphate. CONCLUSIONS: The binding synergism of glucose and Gluc-6-P probably arises out of the mutual stabilization of a common (glucose-bound) conformation of hexokinase I. Conformational changes in the N-terminal domain in response to glucose, phosphate, and/or Gluc-6-P may influence the binding of ATP to the C-terminal domain.

TI  - Transport of the new chemotherapeutic agent beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard (D-19575) into tumor cells is mediated by the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SAAT1.  
AB  - For beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard (beta-D-Glc-IPM), a new alkylating drug in which isophosphoramide mustard is stabilized, a higher selectivity and lower myelotoxicity was observed than for the currently used cytostatic ifosfamide. Because beta-D-Glc-IPM is hydrophilic and does not diffuse passively through the lipid bilayer, we investigated whether a transporter may be involved in the cellular uptake. A variety of cloned Na+-sugar cotransporters were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and uptake measurements were performed. By tracer uptake and electrical measurements it was found that beta-D-Glc-IPM was transported by the low-affinity Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SAAT1, which had been cloned from pig and is also expressed in humans. At membrane potentials between -50 and -150 mV, a 10-fold higher substrate affinity (Km approximately 0.25 mM) and a 10-fold lower Vmax value were estimated for beta-D-Glc-IPM transport than for the transport of D-glucose or methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (AMG). Transport of beta-D-Glc-IPM and glucose by SAAT1 is apparently performed by the same mechanism because similar sodium dependence, dependence on membrane potential, electrogenicity, and phlorizin inhibition were determined for beta-D-Glc-IPM, D-glucose, and AMG. Transcription of human SAAT1 was demonstrated in various human carcinomas and tumor cell lines. In one of these, the human carcinoma cell line T84, phlorizin inhibitable uptake of beta-D-Glc-IPM was demonstrated with substrate saturation and an apparent Km of 0.4 mM. The data suggest that the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SAAT1 transports beta-D-Glc-IPM into human tumor cells and may accumulate the drug in the cells. They provide an example for drug targeting by employing a plasma membrane transporter.

TI  - Fasting hyperglycaemia following trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Following a hyperosmolar diabetic coma in a cirrhotic patient with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization, we assessed the prevalence, severity, causes and prognostic impact of impaired glucose metabolism following transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization. METHODS: Plasma glucose, pancreatic and thyroid hormones, cortisol, growth hormone, ACTH and TSH concentrations were determined before and after transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization in 98 patients (70 with a normal fasting glucose, 7 with mild fasting hyperglycaemia and 21 diabetics) undergoing 226 transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization procedures. Child status, body temperature, serum ALT and amylase levels, tumour size, gelfoam embolization and disease aetiology were recorded. Liver function was assessed before and after transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization by measuring monoethylglycinexylidide formation after i.v. lidocaine. RESULTS: A significant rise in glucose levels (p < 0.0001) was observed in 30/98 patients. Hyperglycaemia was more frequent in diabetics (67%) and patients with mild fasting hyperglycaemia (71%). Glucose concentrations doubled in 12 patients; 4 required long-term insulin. Fever, a previously altered carbohydrate metabolism and raised ALT levels were prognostic factors for hyperglycaemia (p < 0.01). Plasma C-peptide, glucose/insulin and glucose/C-peptide ratios, were increased after transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (p < 0.05). Transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization was followed by a reduction in the monoethylglycinexylidide formation capacity (p < 0.05), particularly in hyperglycaemia patients (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization is frequently followed by a derangement in glucose metabolism which is potentially severe, associated with preceding glucose imbalance, fever and a transient deterioration in liver function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemia is a well-known complication in neonates small for gestational age and in those with diabetic mothers. Birth asphyxiated infants can develop severe hypoglycemia due to reduced glycogen stores. CASE REPORTS: The first patient was born at 41 weeks, weighing 3,780 g by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. He developed a pneumothorax and hypoglycemia. He was given glucose infusion (at day 4: 20 mg/kg/d). Hyperinsulinism was confirmed: blood levels at 18.3 mU/L on day 1 and 11.7 mU/L on day 2. The infusion rate was gradually decreased. The second patient was born at 39 weeks, weighing 2,780 g by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. She needed glucose infusion (24 g/kg/d) because of hypoglycemia with hyperinsulinism (12.8 mU/L on day 2 and 11.7 mU/L on day 3). After 5 days, the infusion of glucose was replaced by oral feeding only. CONCLUSION: Transient hypoglycemia in asphyxiated newborn infants with hyperinsulinism must be considered even when hypoglycemia may be difficult to prove.

TI  - The localization of endogenous zinc and the in vitro effect of exogenous zinc on the GABA immunoreactivity and formation of reactive oxygen species in the retina.  
AB  - 1. Endogenous zinc is localized mainly in the retinal photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells in the mammalian retina. No other types of retinal neurons contain large amounts of zinc. 2. Low concentrations of exogenous zinc, like the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist MK-801, counteract the NMDA-induced changes in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivity in the rabbit retina. However, greater concentrations of zinc exacerbate the effects of NMDA and ischemic-like insults (lack of glucose and oxygen) on GABA immunoreactivity. The data suggest that low concentrations of zinc are neuroprotective, but higher concentrations of zinc have a negative effect. 3. When low concentrations of zinc are present during ischemic-like insults to the retina, the GABA immunoreactivity is localized to the Muller cells, suggesting that the metabolism of GABA in the Muller glial cells is prevented. 4. Ascorbate/iron-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the retina is prevented by deferoxamine but not by zinc. High concentrations of zinc potentiate the ascorbate/iron induced formation of ROS.

TI  - [Anesthetic management involving difficult intubation in a child with Gaucher disease]  
AB  - Gaucher disease is the most common of the glycolipid storage disorders caused by the deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. Accumulation of the substrate leads to multiorgan dysfunction involving the brain, spleen, liver, lymph node and bone marrow. In anesthetic management, gastroesophageal reflux leading to recurrent aspiration, pancytopenia and airway difficulties due to trismus, neck extension and upper airway infiltration with glucocerebroside must be considered. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy presenting developmental delay, mild pancytopenia, splenomegary gastroesophageal reflux. He was scheduled for measurement of intra-esophageal pressure, total splenectomy and Nissen fundoplication. Preoperative examination showed trismus and opisthotonic posturing. We predicted difficult airway maintenance and assessed his airway with airway radiograph. Airway narrowing was not shown. For this difficult airway, we made a special mask that has an introducer port for fiberbronchoscope. For the first time, we tried to insert a laryngeal mask, but the insertion was difficult due to trismus and narrowed oral cavity. Then, we used this special mask for the next time. Tracheal intubation was much safer by using this mask for fiberoptic intubation. In Gaucher disease, preoperative assessment of airway difficulties and preparation for this situation are necessary and anesthesiologist must be concerned about aspiration and airway difficulties.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic study of peritoneal absorption of glucose and alanine in rats: nutritional implications.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to study the serum bioavailability of glucose and alanine after bolus injection into the peritoneal cavity in Wistar rats and to determine the influence of their metabolism on the rate of absorption of these nutrients. METHODS: A group of animals (n = 14) was infused intraperitioneally (i.p.) or i.v. with 2 microCi of nonmetabolizable L-[1-14C] glucose diluted in 5 mL of 5% D-glucose/250 g body wt, after which plasma radioactivity was determined. A second group of animals (n = 14) received, either i.p. or i.v., 3 microCi of nonmetabolizable D-[U-14C] alanine diluted in 2 mL of an iso-os-molar L-amino acid solution/250 g body wt, after which both plasma radioactivity and L-alanine concentration were determined. The constants of absorption from peritoneal cavity (Ka) and elimination from plasma (Ke) and the serum absolute bioavailability (BA(a)) after 8 h were calculated assuming a bicompartment pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: L-glucose: Ka = 3.05 +/- 0.97 h-1; Ke = 0.40 +/- 0.12 h-1; BA(a) = 94% +/- 4%. D-alanine: Ka = 1.08 +/- 0.40 h-1; Ke = 0.11 +/- 0.06 h-1; BAa = 90% +/- 11%. L-alanine: Ka = 1.75 +/- 0.273 h-1; Ke = 0.02 +/- 0.01 h-1; BA(a) = 99% +/- 1%. No hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or glycosuria appeared in any case. CONCLUSIONS: The absorption rate from peritoneal cavity is nearly 10-fold higher than the elimination rate from plasma for the three substrates. Eight hours after i.p. injection an absolute bioavailability almost as high as after i.v. injection (i.e., close to 100%) was achieved. The metabolism of the nutrients seems to help the peritoneal absorption, as L-alanine is better absorbed then D-alanine. These results show that upon i.p. injection the studied nutrients are almost completely absorbed in a short period of time without hyperglycemia or neoglucogenesis and so suggest that their administration may be a feasible approach to feeding patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. This model could be applied to other compounds, such as peptides and disaccharides.

TI  - [Hibernating myocardium and the 'no reflow' phenomenon: a study of absolute regional myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography in chronic and acute heart disorders]  
AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool for in vivo measurements of physiologic processes such as regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism. Myocardial blood flow is often studied using radioactive labeled ammonia (13NH3) while myocardial metabolism can be investigated using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Moreover, the use of appropriate kinetic models allows quantification of these processes. In this study, myocardial viability in both chronic and acute heart disease was investigated by the use of positron emission tomography. In this context, viable refers to dysfunctioning areas of the myocardium in which functional recovery is observed after revascularization. In patients suffering chronic coronary artery disease, PET findings of flow and metabolism were correlated with myocardial ultrastructure. In dysfunctional myocardial segments, normal 13NH3 uptake or decreased 13NH3 uptake with relatively increased FDG uptake (PET mismatch) indicates the possibility for functional recovery after bypass surgery. Since absence of scar tissue in these segments is likely to be required for functional recovery, it was not surprising that little fibrosis was found in myocardial biopsies taken in PET mismatch areas. The biopsies also revealed the presence of viable myocardial cells showing a variable loss of contractile material. The contractile material was replaced by glycogen. One could wonder about the time course needed for functional recovery after restoration of blood flow in the presence of a considerable amount of cells lacking a normal contractile apparatus. It would therefore be interesting to study functional recovery at different time points in patients with variable amounts of these myolytic cells. Probably, recovery of contractility would be slower in myocardial areas with a larger amount of abnormal cells. Another question that arises is the meaning of the increased FDG signal in dysfunctional, though viable myocardium. At first sight, glycogen storage in myolytic cells seems an excellent candidate to explain the increased intake of FDG in PET mismatch areas. However, in this study, in areas considered nonviable by PET, similar amounts of myolytic cells were found. Histologically altered cells might represent a structural and protective adaptation to long term hypoperfusion or to repetitive episodes of ischemia. Another possibility for the increased FDG uptake is an enhancement of glucose utilization in the mismatch areas not only in the myolytic cells, but also in the morphologically normal cell fractions. In patients with a PET mismatch pattern, significant recovery of flow and function was observed after surgery with a significant decrease in glucose utilization. Although it would have been interesting to histologically study the fate of myolytic cells in these recovered areas, this was not possible for obvious ethical reasons. In areas considered non viable by PET expressing a concordant decrease of 13NH3 and FDG uptake (PET match), no recovery of function, flow or metabolism was noted at follow-up. Another study was conducted in our department in infarct patients in which regional myocardial blood was measured within 24 hours after successful thrombolysis. The aim was to investigate the presence of impaired tissue perfusion in the acute stage and to evaluate its effect on recovery of flow, metabolism and function. In about 30% of patients with a TIMI 3 patent vessel, seriously impaired tissue flow was observed in the acute stage. Whether this impairment was due to irreversible damage to capillaries or myocytes, to reperfusion injury or to the presence of multiple distal thrombi remains unknown. Most patients showing severely impaired regional myocardial blood flow in the acute stage revealed absence of viable myocardium on follow-up PET NH3/FDG scans.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of an invertase and its repressor genes from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  
AB  - PCR was used to isolate an invertase homolog gene from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The cloned inv1(+) gene encodes a protein of 581 amino acids with 16 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, and has 39% and 38% identity to the Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC2 invertases. When the inv1(+) gene was disrupted, S. pombe strains lacked detectable invertase activity. This result showed that the inv1(+) gene encodes only one active invertase in S. pombe cells. The transcription of inv1(+) is repressed in the presence of glucose. The transcription of inv1(+) was not affected in cyr1Delta strain which lacks adenylate cyclase activity, unlike transcription of S. pombe fbp1(+) gene. We have identified an S. pombe gene (scr1(+)) that encodes a homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans CREA which is required for glucose repression of the glyconeogenic pathway. Although the deletion of scr1(+) did not influence the transcription of fbp1(+) gene, glucose repression of the inv1(+) gene was severely affected. These results showed that glucose repression of inv1(+) gene is dependent on scr1(+) gene, and S. pombe cAMP signalling pathway may not be essential for glucose repression of inv1(+) gene.

TI  -  Glucose and glycogen utilisation in myocardial ischemia--changes in metabolism and consequences for the myocyte.  
AB  - Experimentally, enhanced glycolytic flux has been shown to confer many benefits to the ischemic heart, including maintenance of membrane activity, inhibition of contracture, reduced arrhythmias, and improved functional recovery. While at moderate low coronary flows, the benefits of glycolysis appear extensive, the controversy arises at very low flow rates, in the absence of flow; or when glycolytic substrate may be present in excess, such that high glucose concentrations with or without insulin overload the cell with deleterious metabolites. Under conditions of total global ischemia, glycogen is the only substrate for glycolytic flux. Glycogenolysis may only be protective until the accumulation of metabolites (lactate, H+, NADH, sugar phosphates and Pi ) outweighs the benefit of the ATP produced. The possible deleterious effects associated with increased glycolysis cannot be ignored, and may explain some of the controversial findings reported in the literature. However, an optimal balance between the rate of ATP production and rate of accumulation of metabolites (determined by the glycolytic flux rate and the rate of coronary washout), may ensure optimal recovery. In addition, the effects of glucose utilisation must be distinguished from those of glycogen, differences which may be explained by functional compartmentation within the cell.

TI  - Screening of gestational diabetes in Tuscany: results in 2000 cases.  
AB  - According to the guidelines of the "Third international workshop conference on GDM", we have examined 2000 pregnant women.  The glucose challenge test (GCT) was positive in 408 cases (20.4%) and negative in 1592 (79.6%). The OGTT (Carpenter and Coustan's criteria) was performed in 647 pregnant women. GDM and IGGT prevalence was of 6.25% and 5.5% respectively and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) 88.25%. The GCT effectiveness for GDM and IGGT diagnosis is: sensibility 75.1%, specificity 44%, positive predictive value 46.4% and negative predictive value 74%. GDM and IGGT compared with NGT women were significantly older (p < 0.05) and prepregnancy BMI was higher (p < 0.01); the prevalence of previous macrosomia (p < 0.01), previous gestational diabetes (p < 0.01) and family history for diabetes mellitus (p < 0.05) was greater in GDM and IGCT. The prevalence of preterm delivery was higher in both GDM and IGCT (GDM 12.5% and IGGT 15.4% vs NGT 6%; p < 0.01), as well as the prevalence of cesarean sections (GDM 31.6% vs IGGT 23.5% and NGT 20.3%; p < 0.02), and the occurrence of macrosomia (GDM 27.6%, IGGT 16.6% and NGT 16.2%). In addition a higher prevalence (p < 0.01) of hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoglycemia and hypertrophy cardiomyopathy was observed in newborns from GDM women. Our data show that: GCT has a good specificity for GDM diagnosis, prevalence of GDM in our population is about 6%, GDM is still correlated to an elevated maternal and neonatal morbility.

TI  - Microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.  
AB  - Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.

TI  - Insulin secretion rates estimated by two mathematical methods in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients.  
AB  - After pancreas-kidney transplantation, it is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the insulin secretion of the pancreas graft, since several pitfalls are involved using peripheral C-peptide and/or insulin measurements in this determination. In this study, the individual kinetic parameters of C-peptide and then the rates of insulin secretion were estimated by two mathematical methods, the deconvolution method and the "combined model" during slow (oral glucose) and fast (intravenous glucagon) changes in insulin secretion in six successful pancreas-kidney transplant recipients with systemic delivery of insulin (Px), six nondiabetic kidney-transplant recipients with portal insulin secretion (Kx), six nondiabetic controls (NS), and six C-peptide-negative insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients (IDDM). Decreased C-peptide clearance and basal and poststimulatory hyperinsulinemia were found in both Px and Kx compared with NS (P < 0.05). Similar glucose responses were observed after intravenous glucagon in all groups, whereas the responses after oral glucose were 30% higher in Px and Kx than in NS (P < 0.05). During oral glucose and after intravenous glucagon, both mathematical methods resulted in significantly lower maximal and incremental insulin secretion rates (ISR) in Px than in Kx (P < 0.05). In contrast, calculations of incremental ISR in NS and Px induced by the two beta-cell stimuli were about the same but significantly higher in Kx than in NS (P < 0.05). These results differed markedly from those obtained using peripheral measurements of insulin and C-peptide alone. In conclusion, when C-peptide clearance and insulin metabolism change, such as in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients, accurate evaluation of insulin secretion from the graft can be obtained only by using individual kinetics of the peptides before calculating the ISR. This study also clearly demonstrates that insulin secretion after pancreas transplantation is still defective.

TI  - In vitro effect of cefodizime, imipenem/cilastatin and co-trimoxazole on dexamethasone and cyclosporin A depressed phagocytosis.  
AB  - Phagocytosis is an important part of the host defense against infection. Antibiotics can influence phagocytic function. In the present study, leukocyte metabolic response to phagocytic challenge by latex was assessed in relation to in vitro addition of cotrimoxazole, imipenem/cilastatin, cefodizime, dexamethasone (DXM), and/or cyclosporin A (CsA). Using latex particles as phagocytic challenge, glucose-1-14C utilization and 14CO2 production were measured by liquid scintillation counting. The phagocytic response was impaired by in vitro addition of DXM or CsA and this setup was used as an experimental model of immunodepression. The addition of co-trimoxazole to control samples (without DXM or CsA) depressed the response to latex challenge, whereas imipenem and cefodizime had a neutral effect. In the presence of DXM, co-trimoxazole induced a further decrease. The depressive effect of DXM was partially neutralized in the presence of cefodizime. With CsA depression, co-trimoxazole also induced a further decrease, imipenem had a neutral effect, while cefodizime partially restored the CsA suppressed reaction. Co-trimoxazole depressed the phagocytic response, imipenem had a neutral effect, whereas cefodizime restored the experimentally induced immunosuppression.

TI  - Leukocyte-endothelial interaction is augmented by high glucose concentrations and hyperglycemia in a NF-kB-dependent fashion.  
AB  - We addressed the role of hyperglycemia in leukocyte-endothelium interaction under flow conditions by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 24 h to normal (5 mM), high concentration of glucose (30 mM), advanced glycosylation end product-albumin (100 microg/ml), or hyperglycemic (174-316 mg/dl) sera from patients with diabetes and abnormal hemoglobin A1c (8.1+/-1.4%). At the end of incubation endothelial cells were perfused with total leukocyte suspension in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow (1.5 dyn/cm2). Rolling and adherent cells were evaluated by digital image processing. Results showed that 30 mM glucose significantly (P < 0. 01) increased the number of adherent leukocytes to endothelial cells in respect to control (5 mM glucose; 151+/-19 versus 33+/-8 cells/mm2). A similar response was induced by endothelial stimulation with IL-1beta, here used as positive control (195+/-20 cells/mm2). The number of rolling cells on endothelial surface was not affected by high glucose level. Stable adhesion of leukocytes to glucose-treated as well as to IL-1beta-stimulated endothelial cells was preceded by short interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface. The distance travelled by leukocytes before arrest on 30 mM glucose, or on IL-1beta-treated endothelial cells, was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than that observed for leukocytes adhering on control endothelium (30 mM glucose: 76.7+/-3.5; IL1beta: 69.7+/-4 versus 5 mM glucose: 21.5+/-5 microm). Functional blocking of E-selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells with the corresponding mouse mAb significantly inhibited glucose-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion (67+/-16, 83+/-12, 62+/-8 versus 144+/-21 cells/ mm2). Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed that 30 mM glucose induced an increase in endothelial surface expression of E-selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed for 1 h to 30 mM glucose revealed an intense NF-kB activation. Treatment of HUVEC exposed to high glucose with the NF-kB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (100 microM) and tosyl-phe-chloromethylketone (25 microM) significantly reduced (P < 0.05) leukocyte adhesion in respect to HUVEC treated with glucose alone. A significant (P < 0.01) inhibitory effect on glucose-induced leukocyte adhesion was observed after blocking protein kinase C activity with staurosporine (5 nM). When HUVEC were treated with specific antisense oligodesoxynucleotides against PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms before the addition of 30 mM glucose, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the adhesion was also seen. Advanced glycosylation end product-albumin significantly increased the number of adhering leukocytes in respect to native albumin used as control (110+/-16 versus 66+/-7, P < 0.01). Sera from diabetic patients significantly (P < 0.01) enhanced leukocyte adhesion as compared with controls, despite normal levels of IL-1beta and TNFalpha in these sera. These data indicate that high glucose concentration and hyperglycemia promote leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium through upregulation of cell surface expression of adhesive proteins, possibly depending on NF-kB activation.

TI  - Effects of exercise on hypoglycaemic responses in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - This study sought to determine whether moderate exercise influences hypoglycaemic responses in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Ten patients with IDDM and no history of hypoglycaemia unawareness or autonomic neuropathy were included. The patients were studied in random order on 4 occasions: twice during euglycaemia (once at rest and once on a treadmill) and twice during a gradual drop in blood glucose from 5 to 2 mmol/l (once at rest and once on a treadmill). Blood samples for hormones and glucose were drawn, and a symptom questionnaire was filled out every 5 min. Cognitive tests were performed at the start and end of each study. Glucose thresholds for hormones and symptoms are reported as the plasma glucose level at which responses were more than two standard deviations above basal level and continued to increase. The thresholds for adrenaline and noradrenaline release came at a significantly higher blood glucose level during exercise than at rest: 2.7 +/- 0.2 vs 2.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (p < 0.05) for adrenaline and 2.7 +/- 0.2 vs 2.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (p < 0.01) for noradrenaline. Thresholds for neuroglycopenic symptoms were also at a significantly higher blood glucose level during exercise: 2.6 +/- 0.2 vs 2.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (p < 0.05). During hypoglycaemia, patients showed a non-significant trend towards a lower score on cognitive tests during exercise than at rest. It is concluded that moderate exercise during a gradual drop in blood glucose does not mask hypoglycaemic responses in patients with IDDM.

TI  - Short-term variations of serum glycated apolipoprotein B.  
AB  - Serum glycated apolipoprotein B (apo B-G) levels were determined in 31 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and 13 control subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apo B-G was increased in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic subjects, whether expressed as a serum concentration (57.7 vs 36.1 mg/l) or a percentage of total apolipoprotein B (4.42 vs 3.14%). Apo B-G, together with other markers (mean daily plasma glucose, serum fructosamines, triglycerides, total cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin), was measured before and after 5 days of therapeutic adjustment in diabetic patients. In 20 patients with a favourable course of glycaemic control, the mean decrease of apo B-G concentration reached nearly 16%. In 11 patients with an unfavourable course, the increase of apo B-G concentration was about 14%. Therefore, variation of serum apo B-G concentration could serve as an additional short-term marker for glycaemic control, although possible concomitant variations of serum triglycerides or total apolipoprotein B concentrations should also be considered.

AB  - Using SDS-PAGE gels we observed the induced synthesis of a protein with a molecular mass of 80 kDa when cells of strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were subjected to dehydration. Physiological analysis showed that this protein is not present during growth on glucose but was found in derepressed cells from stationary phase. Furthermore, its synthesis was induced when cells were grown on medium containing alpha-methyl-glucoside as carbon source. However, the 80 kDa protein was not found in cells of mutants unable to transport trehalose. This protein was localized in the cytoplasmic membrane and showed trehalose-binding activity, determined by its partial purification on a trehalose-Sepharose 6B affinity column. The possible involvement of the 80 kDa protein with the trehalose transport system is discussed.

TI  - Regional glucose metabolic abnormalities are not the result of atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the hypometabolism observed in PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is due entirely to brain atrophy. BACKGROUND: Reduced brain glucose metabolism in AD patients measured using PET has been reported by numerous authors. Actual glucose metabolic values in AD may be reduced artificially because of brain atrophy, which accentuates the partial volume effect (PVE) on data collected by PET. METHODS: Using segmented MR images, we corrected regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose for PVEs to evaluate the effect of atrophy on uncorrected values for brain metabolism in AD patients and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Global glucose metabolism was reduced significantly before and after correction in AD patients compared with controls. Before PVE correction, glucose metabolic values in patients were lower than in control subjects in the inferior parietal, frontal, and lateral temporal cortex; in the posterior cingulate; and in the precuneus. These reductions remained significantly lower after PVE correction, although in the posterior cingulate the difference in metabolism between AD patients and control subjects lessened. Regional glucose metabolism of these areas with PVE correction was lower in moderately-severely demented patients than in mildly demented patients. CONCLUSION: Reduced glucose metabolism measured by PET in AD is not simply an artifact due to an increase in CSF space induced by atrophy, but reflects a true metabolic reduction per gram of tissue.

TI  - Problems in assessing diabetes control in an ambulatory setting.  
AB  - Problems in using medical records to assess outcomes of diabetes care have not been well defined. We reviewed the medical records of 288 patients with diabetes receiving ambulatory care over a 2-year period. We determined the availability of different tests of glycemic control and described site performance as the percentage of patients with a blood glucose exceeding either 180 or 240 mg/dl. Glycosylated hemoglobin determinations were performed in only 26.7% of patients. A blood glucose was available in 208 patients (72.2%) during a 6-month outcome period. For almost 50% of the sample, the glucose was greater than 180 mg/dl, whereas in 20% it exceeded 240 mg/dl. Judgments of whether sites differed in performance depended on how control was defined.  Using a single glucose determination and a threshold of 180 mg/dl, similar fractions of patients were poorly controlled at each site (51.2 versus 45.0 versus 47.0%) (P = 0.75). At 240 mg/dl, although, one site performed much worse than the other two (14.6 versus 16.7 versus 31.8%) (P = 0.02). These results highlight difficulties in defining the outcome measure when using medical records to evaluate quality of care.

TI  - Chronic central leptin infusion enhances insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and favors the expression of uncoupling proteins.  
AB  - Continuous (4 days) intracerebroventricular leptin infusion (12 microg/day) was performed in lean rats, and its hormonometabolic effects were determined. Intracerebroventricular leptin administration did not result in leakage of the hormone into the peripheral circulation. Thus, its effects were elicited by its presence within the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular leptin infusion produced marked decreases in food intake and body weight gain relative to vehicle-infused fed ad libitum rats. Because decreases in food intake alter hormonometabolic homeostasis, additional control rats pair-fed to the amount of food consumed by leptin-infused ones were included in the study. Intracerebroventricular leptin-infused and vehicle-infused pair-fed rats were characterized, relative to vehicle-infused ad libitum-fed animals, by decreases in body weight and insulinemia and by increases in insulin-stimulated overall glucose utilization and muscle and brown adipose tissue glucose utilization index. Brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein (UCP)1, UCP2, and UCP3 mRNA levels were markedly decreased in pair-fed animals relative to those of fed ad libitum control animals, as were liver and white adipose tissue UCP2 and muscle UCP3 mRNA levels. In marked contrast, intracerebroventricular leptin administration was accompanied by the maintenance of high UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 expression in all these tissues. Thus, despite analogies between leptin's effects and those of pair-feeding with regard to glucose handling, their respective underlying mechanisms differ. While leptin maintains or favors energy-dissipating mechanisms (UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3), the latter are markedly depressed in pair-fed rats. This effect of leptin may prevent subsequent excessive storage processes, thereby maintaining normal body homeostasis.

TI  - Pancreatic beta-cell regeneration after 48-h glucose infusion in mildly diabetic rats is not correlated with functional improvement.  
AB  - We investigated the effect of glucose infusion on beta-cell regeneration in rats made mildly diabetic by a single injection of low dosage (35 mg/kg) streptozotocin (STZ). Nondiabetic (ND) and STZ rats were submitted to a 48-h glucose infusion (hyperglycemia approximately 22 mmol/l in both groups: ND and STZ hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic [ND HG-HI and STZ HG-HI rats]). Before infusion, beta-cell mass was 65% lower in STZ rats than in ND rats (2.0 +/- 0.02 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.6 mg), 1.6-fold increased in ND HG-HI rats (8.7 +/- 1.7 mg), and 2.7-fold increased in STZ HG-HI rats (5.4 +/- 0.9 mg). In ND HG-HI rats, beta-cell enlargement was related to an increase in beta-cell responsiveness to nutrient secretagogues both in vivo and in vitro, whereas in STZ HG-HI rats, no significant improvement in insulin secretion could be noticed. To determine the respective role of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on beta-cell area changes, ND and STZ rats were submitted to a 48-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. No modification of beta-cell mass was detected in either group. In conclusion, 48-h superimposed hyperglycemia was enough to restore beta-cell mass previously reduced by STZ injection. This effect seemed to be due to hyperglycemia rather than hyperinsulinemia alone. The data stress the dissociation between beta-cell regeneration and improvement in islet function in diabetic rats. Our model seems suitable for studying factors that can improve the plasticity and function of the pancreas in NIDDM.

TI  - Modulation of glucose transport in fetal rat lung: a sexual dimorphism.  
AB  - Male fetuses exhibit delayed lung maturation and surfactant production in comparison with female fetuses. This delay may be related to sex hormone effects: estrogen enhances and androgens delay lung development. The uptake of glucose, an important precursor for surfactant synthesis, may be differently affected by estrogen and androgens. In these studies we determined the effects of these two hormones on glucose transport (glucose uptake, glucose transporter [Glut] 1 protein, and mRNA) and hexokinase activity in lung tissue of fetal rats. On Day 20 of gestation (term = 21.5 d) lung tissue was harvested from female and male fetal rats, minced into explants, and cultured for 24 h. Basal glucose uptake, measured in the absence of sex hormones, was 37% higher (P < 0.05) in female compared with male lungs. Explants were washed and cultured for an additional 3 h or 24 h in either estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at 0, 1, 10, or 100 nM. Twenty-four-hour treatment with estradiol in both male and female explants increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake, Glut 1 protein, and mRNA levels (P < 0.05). However, explants from male fetuses were not as responsive to estradiol treatment as were those from females (P < 0.05). Treatment for 24 h with DHT decreased 2-deoxyglucose uptake, Glut 1 protein, and mRNA levels in females and males (P < 0.05). There was no difference in response between females and males. Short-term incubation (3 h) with sex hormones had no effect on glucose uptake. However, 3-h treatment with estradiol did increase Glut 1 mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Hexokinase activity was not affected by estradiol or DHT treatment. These findings indicate that estradiol and DHT differentially regulate glucose uptake in fetal rat lung tissue. This regulation of substrate supply (glucose) by estradiol and DHT may be another mechanism for the sexual dimorphism observed in lung development and surfactant synthesis.

TI  - N-acetylglucosamine changes permeability of peritoneum during chronic peritoneal dialysis in rats.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of supplementation of dialysis fluid with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the permeability of peritoneum during chronic peritoneal dialysis in rats. DESIGN: Experiments were performed on rats with surgically implanted peritoneal catheters. Dialysis solution [Dianeal 1.5% (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) supplemented with either NAG 50 mmol/L or glucose 50 mmol/L (control)] was infused intraperitoneally twice, every day, for 8 weeks. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) were performed in all animals at the beginning of the study and after 8 weeks of dialysis. Additionally, at the end of each week, dialysis solution infused in the morning was drained after 4 hours of intraperitoneal dwell. White blood cell count, creatinine, and total protein concentrations were measured in the effluent dialysate. After 8 weeks of dialysis, the morphology of the peritoneum was studied. RESULTS: In rats exposed to dialysis fluid supplemented with NAG, peritoneal permeability to creatinine and proteins was reduced when compared to animals dialyzed with glucose solution. In NAG treated animals, staining with alcian blue for polyanions in the peritoneal interstitium was significantly stronger than in rats dialyzed with glucose solution. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic peritoneal dialysis with dialysis solution supplemented with N-acetylglucosamine causes accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the peritoneal interstitium, which results in a change of peritoneal permeability.

TI  - Zinc supplementation improves glucose disposal in patients with cirrhosis [see comments]  
AB  - Zinc deficiency is common in cirrhosis, and was proved to affect nitrogen metabolism. In experimental animals, zinc status may also affect glucose disposal, and acute zinc supplementation improves glucose tolerance in healthy subjects. This study was aimed at measuring the effects of long-term oral zinc supplements on glucose tolerance in cirrhosis. The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide in response to an intravenous (i.v.) glucose load were analyzed by the minimal-model technique before and after long-term oral zinc supplements (200 mg three times per day for 60 days) in 10 subjects with advanced cirrhosis and impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. The test was performed using a simplified procedure, based on 20 blood samples collected within 4 hours from the glucose load. Normal values were obtained in 25 age-matched healthy subjects. Zinc levels were low to normal or reduced before treatment, and were normalized by oral zinc. Glucose disappearance improved by greater than 30% in response to treatment. There were no changes in pancreatic insulin secretion and systemic delivery, or in the hepatic extraction of insulin. Insulin sensitivity (SI), which was reduced by 80% before treatment, did not change. Glucose effectiveness (SG) was nearly halved in cirrhosis before treatment (0.013 [SD 0.007] min(-1) v. 0.028 [SD 0.009] in controls; P < .001), and increased to 0.017 (SD 0.009) after zinc (P < .05 v. baseline). The return to normal of plasma zinc levels after long-term zinc treatment in advanced cirrhosis improves glucose tolerance via an increase of the effects of glucose per se on glucose metabolism. Poor zinc status may contribute to the impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes of cirrhosis.

TI  - Abdominal obesity, impaired nonesterified fatty acid suppression, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal are early metabolic abnormalities in families with premature myocardial infarction.  
AB  - British Indian Asian men aged <40 years have a twofold to threefold increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with British whites. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia with premature CHD in Indian Asians. We tested the association of insulin action with myocardial infarction (MI) by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in 17 MI patients: 8 Punjabi Sikhs (PSMIs), 9 British whites (BWMIs), and 17 control subjects (9 PSCs and 8 BWCs). Metabolic factors associated with insulin resistance were investigated in 51 MI patients (24 PSMIs and 27 BWMIs) and 53 control subjects (28 PSCs and 25 BWCs). Familial aggregation of defective insulin action was examined by studying five pedigrees of Sikh survivors of MI. Sikh survivors of premature MI demonstrated impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake (P<.001) by use of the clamp technique and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) suppression (P<.05) by using both clamp techniques and the oral glucose tolerance test, as compared with Sikh control subjects. White patients had impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake but normal NEFA suppression. Metabolic factors usually associated with insulin resistance, including increased 2-hour post-oral glucose tolerance test triglycerides, smaller low density lipoprotein particle size, and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, were present in white (all P<.05) but surprisingly absent in Sikh (all P>.05) MI patients compared with respective ethnic control subjects. Fasting glucose and total cholesterol levels did not differ between patients and control subjects. Abdominal obesity, impaired NEFA suppression after oral glucose, and fasting hyperinsulinemia were present in Sikh MI patients and their nondiabetic first-degree relatives compared with Sikh control subjects. PS survivors of premature MI demonstrated impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal and NEFA suppression compared with ethnic control subjects. BWMI patients showed abnormalities of carbohydrate, but not of NEFA, metabolism compared with white control subjects. Defects of insulin action manifested as abdominal obesity, impaired NEFA suppression, and fasting hyperinsulinemia are present in Sikh MI patients and their asymptomatic, nondiabetic, first-degree relatives. We suggest that these defects may be early metabolic markers that predict risk of premature MI among PSs.

TI  - Metabolic labeling of a subset of glial cells by UDP-galactose: implication for astrocyte lineage diversity.  
AB  - Astrocytes are implicated in many aspects of brain function; however, it remains unclear whether astrocytes arise from a single cell lineage. It is therefore important to obtain new markers for the astrocyte cell lineage. We show that exogenously added UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) can be used to metabolically label a subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP+) cells. UDP-Gal was incorporated into the cultured embryonic mouse brain slices in a time-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the transferred sugar moiety was no longer Gal but was mainly glucose. Most of the radioactivity was transferred to a polymer of glucose, most likely to be glycogen, and also to glucosyl ceramide. In the slice culture, the reaction products were distributed densely in the ventricular zone and also on process-like structures extending to the pial surface. In dissociation culture, UDP-Gal labeled some of the GFAP+ cells and some of the vimentin+ cells. Because radial glial cells (RGCs) contain glycogen and change from vimentin+ to GFAP+, it is strongly suggested that UDP-Gal labeled RGCs and their descendants. Only 27% of the GFAP+ cells were labeled with UDP-Gal, which suggests that only a subset of astrocytes are derived from RGCs and that there is a discrete group of GFAP+ cells that is not generated from RGCs.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-stimulated pancreatic beta-cell growth is glucose-dependent. Synergistic activation of insulin receptor substrate-mediated signal transduction pathways by glucose and IGF-I in INS-1 cells.  
AB  - Nutrients and certain growth factors stimulate pancreatic beta-cell mitogenesis, however, the appropriate mitogenic signal transduction pathways have not been defined. In the glucose-sensitive pancreatic beta-cell line, INS-1, it was found that glucose (6-18 mM) independently increased INS-1 cell proliferation (>20-fold at 15 mM glucose). Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-induced INS-1 cell proliferation was glucose-dependent only in the physiologically relevant concentration range (6-18 mM glucose). The combination of IGF-I and glucose was synergistic, increasing INS-1 cell proliferation >50-fold at 15 mM glucose + 10 nM IGF-I. Glucose metabolism and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3'-kinase) activation were necessary for both glucose and IGF-I-stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation. IGF-I and 15 mM glucose increased tyrosine phosphorylation mediated recruitment of Grb2/mSOS and PI 3'-kinase to IRS-2 and pp60. Glucose and IGF-I also induced Shc association with Grb2/mSOS. Glucose (3-18 mM) and IGF-I, independently of glucose, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase but this did not correlate with IGF-I-induced beta-cell proliferation. In contrast, p70(S6K) was activated with increasing glucose concentration (between 6 and 18 mM), and potentiated by IGF-I in the same glucose concentration range which correlated with INS-1 cell proliferation rate. Thus, glucose and IGF-I-induced beta-cell proliferation were mediated via a signaling mechanism that was facilitated by mitogen-activated protein kinase but dependent on IRS-mediated induction of PI 3'-kinase activity and downstream activation of p70(S6K). The glucose dependence of IGF-I mediated INS-1 cell proliferation emphasizes beta-cell signaling mechanisms are rather unique in being tightly linked to glycolytic metabolic flux.

AB  - Ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80) catalyzes the first glycosylation step of glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis, the transfer of glucose from UDP-Glucose to hydrophobic ceramide and generate glucosylceramide (GlcCer). We have cloned mouse ceramide glucosyltransferase cDNA from a brain cDNA library by PCR based homology cloning. The nucleotide sequence determination revealed that mouse ceramide glucosyltransferase cDNA encodes 394 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 45 kDa. The amino acid sequence of mouse ceramide glucosyltransferase showed 98% identity with the human sequence. Homology searches against currently available databases identified three homologous proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and one homologous protein in Cyanobacteria. Highly conserved sequences of ceramide glucosyltransferases and the homologs among a wide variety of organisms suggest biological significance of the lipid glucosylation system.

TI  - Function and survival of macroencapsulated syngeneic islets transplanted into streptozocin-diabetic mice.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macroencapsulation is a strategy to protect transplanted islets from rejection and autoimmune attack. This study addresses questions about the survival and function of macroencapsulated syngeneic islets. METHODS: Planar immunobarrier membrane diffusion devices were used for syngeneic islet transplantation. After being mixed with a 1% alginate solution, a total of 250, 500, 750 or 1000 islets were loaded into the devices, which were implanted into the epididymal fat pad(s) of streptozocin diabetic mice. RESULTS: The success rate for restoration of normoglycemia at week 4 was highest for the recipients receiving two devices, each with 500 islets. Loading 750 or 1000 islets provided no improvement over loading 500 islets in a single device. Devices containing 250 islets were rarely successful. There was a striking tendency of transplants to either bring glucose levels into the near normal range or to fail with marked hyperglycemia. After an overnight fast at 1 and 4 weeks, but not at 12 weeks, hypoglycemia was found. The insulin content of devices from animals with normalized glucose values was higher than the insulin content in failed devices. Islet volume was maintained for 12 weeks, and fibrosis did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively small mass of macroencapsulated islet tissue can survive and function well enough to normalize glucose levels for at least 12 weeks. Maintenance of glucose levels in the near-normal range seems to have a beneficial influence on graft success. The finding of fasting hypoglycemia raises important clinical questions about islet dysfunction. Important limitations in the requirements for islet packing density in macroencapsulation have been defined. New approaches for improving islet packing density must be developed to make diffusion-dependent macroencapsulation more practical.

TI  - Is growth hormone hypersecretion in diabetic adolescent girls also a daytime problem?  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Glycaemic control often deteriorates during puberty in girls with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). This may be due in part to the normal psychosocial changes associated with adolescence. Puberty is, however, also characterized by rapid somatic development, orchestrated by hormonal changes. Some of these hormones play a major role in glucose homeostasis. We have examined the insulin-GH-IGF-I axis in 11 adolescent girls with poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetes and compared the data with those of 10 non-diabetic girls matched for age, pubertal stage and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Serum profiles of glucose, insulin, GH and IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) were analysed in addition to IGF-I in serum and nocturnal urinary excretion of GH. MEASUREMENTS: Serum glucose, insulin and IGFBP1 were measured every hour for 24 h, whereas GH in serum was measured every 30 minutes during the same period. Nocturnal urinary GH was analysed as a mean of three consecutive nights. RESULTS: The insulin profiles of the IDDM patients were flat with low post-prandial peaks, corresponding to only one-third of the peaks of the non-diabetic girls. The integrated insulin levels, both during 24-h sampling and during daytime, were significantly lower in the diabetic group. There were no differences during night-time. The diabetic patients had elevated mean baseline levels of serum GH (IDDM 2.8 +/- 0.5 mU/l, controls 0.7 +/- 0.2; P < 0.001), a higher 24-h mean serum GH level (9.8 +/- 1.7 mU/l vs. 4.4 +/- 0.7; P < 0.001), significantly more peaks and a urinary GH excretion twice as high as in the non-diabetic group. An interesting observation was the finding of marked differences in daytime GH concentrations between the groups, both regarding overall integrated levels (GH AUC 103 +/- 15.8 and 35.9 +/- 7.1 mU/l x 12 h, respectively; P < 0.005) as well as baseline levels (3.8 +/- 0.6 mU/l vs. 0.7 +/- 0.2; P < 0.001). In contrast, during night-time only the mean basal levels of GH differed. The level of IGF-I was reduced in the diabetic group compared with the healthy controls (IDDM 233 +/- 19 micrograms/l vs. controls 327 +/- 21; P < 0.005). In addition, the IDDM patients had significantly increased concentrations of IGFBP 1, but kept a normal diurnal rhythm with a pronounced night peak. CONCLUSION: Hypoinsulinaemia in adolescent IDDM patients, particularly in the portal hepatic circulation, results in decreased IGF-I and increased IGFBP 1 production in the liver. High levels of IGFBP 1 may, in turn, reduce the bioactivity of IGF-I even further. Low levels of IGF-I will lead to increased GH secretion. Earlier studies on the relationship between GH and diabetic control have focused on elevated GH levels during the night. In this study we have observed markedly elevated levels of GH also during daytime in adolescent IDDM patients. This indicates increased insulin resistance and insulin demand also during the day in diabetic subjects. The increased insulin resistance may result in hyperglycaemia leading to additional insulin resistance. A vicious circle may thus be induced, accelerating metabolic impairment in poorly controlled adolescent IDDM girls.

TI  - Effect of growth rate on resistance of Candida albicans biofilms to antifungal agents.  
AB  - A perfused biofilm fermentor, which allows growth-rate control of adherent microbial populations, was used to assess whether the susceptibility of Candida albicans biofilms to antifungal agents is dependent on growth rate. Biofilms were generated under conditions of glucose limitation and were perfused with drugs at a high concentration (20 times the MIC). Amphotericin B produced a greater reduction in the number of daughter cells in biofilm eluates than ketoconazole, fluconazole, or flucytosine. Similar decreases in daughter cell counts were observed when biofilms growing at three different rates were perfused with amphotericin B. In a separate series of experiments, intact biofilms, resuspended biofilm cells, and newly formed daughter cells were removed from the fermentor and were exposed to a lower concentration of amphotericin B for 1 h. The susceptibility profiles over a range of growth rates were then compared with those obtained for planktonic cells grown at the same rates under glucose limitation in a chemostat. Intact biofilms were resistant to amphotericin B at all growth rates tested, whereas planktonic cells were resistant only at low growth rates (</=0.13 h-1). Cells resuspended from biofilms were less resistant than intact biofilm populations but more resistant than daughter cells; the susceptibilities of both these cell types were largely independent of growth rate. Our findings indicate that the amphotericin B resistance of C. albicans biofilms is not simply due to a low growth rate but depends on some other feature of the biofilm mode of growth.

TI  - Control of pulsatile 5-HT/insulin secretion from single mouse pancreatic islets by intracellular calcium dynamics.  
AB  - 1.  Glucose-induced insulin release from single islets of Langerhans is pulsatile. We have investigated the correlation between changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and oscillatory insulin secretion from single mouse islets, in particular examining the basis for differences in secretory responses to intermediate and high glucose concentrations. Insulin release was monitored in real time through the amperometric detection of the surrogate insulin marker 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) via carbon fibre microelectrodes. The [Ca2+]i was simultaneously recorded by whole-islet fura-2 microfluorometry. 2. In 82 % of the experiments, exposure to 11 mM glucose evoked regular high-frequency (average, 3.4 min-1) synchronous oscillations in amperometric current and [Ca2+]i. In the remaining experiments (18 %), 11 mM glucose induced an oscillatory pattern consisting of high-frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations that were superimposed on low-frequency (average, 0.32 min-1) [Ca2+]i waves. Intermittent high-frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations gave rise to a similar pattern of pulsatile 5-HT release. 3. Raising the glucose concentration from 11 to 20 mM increased the duration of the steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations without increasing their amplitude. In contrast, both the duration and amplitude of the associated 5-HT transients were increased by glucose stimulation. The amount of 5-HT released per secretion cycle was linearly related to the duration of the underlying [Ca2+]i oscillations in both 11 and 20 mM glucose. The slopes of the straight lines were identical, indicating that there is no significant difference between the ability of calcium oscillations to elicit 5-HT/insulin release in 11 and 20 mM glucose. 4. In situ 5-HT microamperometry has the potential to resolve the high-frequency oscillatory component of the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion. This component appears to reflect primarily the duration of the underlying [Ca2+]i oscillations, suggesting that glucose metabolism and/or access to glucose metabolites is not rate limiting to fast pulsatile insulin release.

TI  - [Propofol anesthesia for a patient with insulinoma]  
AB  - We experienced the anesthetic management of a 47-year-old woman with insulinoma. Removal of the tumor was performed under propofol, nitrous oxide, and epidural anesthesia. We tried the continuous infusion of glucose to maintain normal blood glucose level and to avoid intraoperative hypoglycemic event. The blood glucose and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) level were measured intermittently. After the removal of the insulinoma, the IRI level decreased rapidly to the normal range. In this case, neither hyperglycemic nor hypoglycemic episode was observed. The perioperative course was uneventful. Propofol has not been shown to significantly affect the release of insulin and glucose regulation. This case suggests that under the condition of continuous glucose infusion and blood glucose monitoring, propofol is an useful anesthetic agent for a patient with insulinoma.

TI  - Differential insulin secretory responses to cationic and branched-chain amino acids.  
AB  - The long-term effects on the dynamics of glucose-stimulated insulin release by the cationic amino acids arginine and lysine and the branched-chain amino acid leucine were examined. The rat pancreas perfusion model was utilized and particular emphasis was placed on modulation of the glucose-stimulated synthesis-secretion coupling second phase. In the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, 20 mM arginine, lysine, and leucine each potentiated first-phase insulin release by approximately 50%, compared to glucose-only controls. Conversely, in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, 20 mM arginine resulted in a 50% inhibition of second-phase (min 30-120) insulin release compared to glucose-only controls. Similarly, 20 mM lysine in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose also caused a comparable inhibition of second-phase insulin release. Paradoxically, 20 mM leucine in the presence of glucose had no significant inhibitory effect on second-phase glucose-stimulated insulin release. The data suggest that these amino acids mediate their effects on first- and second-phase insulin release via different mechanisms of action, which may reflect differences and similarities in charge and/or metabolic fates within the beta cell. The data do not support the hypothesis that cationic charge is solely involved in the stimulus-secretion component, since all three amino acids caused comparable potentiation of first-phase insulin release. Conversely, the inhibitory component of the second secretory phase may be mediated via a common charge-related metabolic pathway in the synthesis-secretion coupling mechanism, since only the cationic amino acids inhibit this component, whereas leucine has no such effect.

TI  - Effects of FFA on insulin-stimulated glucose fluxes and muscle glycogen synthase activity in rats.  
AB  - To examine effects of free fatty acids (FFA) on insulin-stimulated glucose fluxes, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (86 pmol . kg-1 . min-1) clamps were performed for 5 h in conscious rats with (n = 8) or without (n = 8) lipid-heparin infusion.  Glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia was not different between the two groups during the first 2 h of clamps but became significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in the 3rd h and thereafter. To investigate changes in intracellular glucose metabolism during lipid-heparin infusion, additional clamps (n = 8 each) were performed for 1, 2, 3, or 5 h with an infusion of [3-3H]glucose. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose utilization (Rd), glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis were estimated on the basis of tracer concentrations in plasma during the final 40 min of each clamp. Similar to changes in glucose infusion rate, Rd was not different between the two groups in the 1st and 2nd h but was significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in the 3rd h and thereafter. Whole body glycolysis was significantly lower with lipid-heparin infusion in all time periods, i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th h of clamps. In contrast, whole body glycogen synthesis was higher with lipid-heparin infusion in the 1st and 2nd h but lower in the 5th h. Similarly, accumulation of [3H]glycogen radioactivity in muscle glycogen was significantly higher with lipid-heparin during the 1st and 2nd h but lower during the 3rd and 5th h. Glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) concentrations in gastrocnemius muscles were significantly higher with lipid-heparin infusion throughout the clamps. Muscle glycogen synthase (GS) activity was not altered with lipid-heparin infusion at 1, 2, and 3 h but was significantly lower at 5 h. Thus increased availability of FFA significantly reduced whole body glycolysis, but compensatory increase in skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis in association with accumulation of G-6-P masked this effect, and Rd was not affected in the early phase (within 2 h) of lipid-heparin infusion. Rd was reduced in the later phase (>2 h) of lipid-heparin infusion, when glycogen synthesis was reduced in association with reduced skeletal muscle GS activity.

TI  - Effect of posture on intraperitoneal pressure and peritoneal permeability in children.  
AB  - The posture of the patient influences both the intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) and the peritoneal permeability. We have studied the effects of the supine and the upright position in six children. Two peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) of 90-min dwell time each were performed consecutively, firstly in the supine position and then in the upright position. The same amount of dialysate was instilled (1,000 ml/m2; isotonic 1.36% dextrose) for each PET. Using the same filling volume, the IPP was significantly higher in the upright position (18.4 +/- 4.8 cm H2O) than in the supine position (8 +/- 2.4 cm H2O). The mean percentage IPP increase was 130% +/- 35%. The decline in glucose resorption rate from the dialysate during the PET was significantly lower in the upright position. Despite this greater relative loss of osmotic gradient in the upright than the supine position, no significant difference in net ultrafiltration was noted after 90 min of dwell. The peritoneal equilibration ratio during the PET was lower in the upright than the supine position for urea, creatinine, and phosphate. These results favor performing peritoneal dialysis in a supine position, both to increase dialysis efficiency and to reduce patient discomfort.

TI  - Glucose and glucoincretin peptides synergize to induce c-fos, c-jun, junB, zif-268, and nur-77 gene expression in pancreatic beta(INS-1) cells.  
AB  -  To link glucose signaling to its long-term pleiotropic effects in the pancreatic beta-cell, we have investigated whether glucose regulates immediate-early response genes (IEGs) coding for transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Glucose causes a coordinated transcriptional activation of the IEGs c-fos, c-jun, JunB, zif-268, and nur-77 in the pancreatic beta-cell line INS-1. This activation is entirely dependent on the presence of the cell-permeant cAMP analog chlorophenylthio-cAMP, which has only a modest effect by itself. The accumulation of c-fos, JunB, and nur-77 mRNA occurs at physiological concentrations of glucose (3 to 11 mM), requires a 1-2 h period, and is mimicked by other nutrient stimuli including mannose, leucine plus glutamine, and pyruvate. Glucose is synergistic with the glucoincretin peptides GLP-1 and PACAP-38, whereas these neurohormonal agents have no effect at low (3 mM) glucose. Mechanistically, the synergy between glucose and the glucoincretins is not based on cAMP alone as glucose does not further increase intracellular cAMP in response to GLP-1 and PACAP-38. A role for Ca2+ signaling is inferred, since the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine markedly reduces the induction of c-fos and nur-77 by glucose and GLP-1. The induction of IEGs by glucose and chlorophenylthio-cAMP or GLP-1 and the inhibitory effect of nifedipine are also observed in the betaHC9 cell line. The results indicate that GLP-1 and PACAP-38 act as competence factors for the action of glucose on c-fos, JunB, and nur-77. It is suggested that the synergistic effect of glucose and glucoincretins on IEG expression plays an important role in the adaptive processes of the beta-cell to hyperglycemia.

TI  - Solute washout experiments for characterizing mass transport in hollow fiber immunoisolation membranes.  
AB  - The transport characteristics of immunoisolation membranes can have a critical effect on the design of hybrid artificial organs and cell therapies. However, it has been difficult to quantitatively evaluate the desired transport properties of different hollow fiber membranes due to bulk mass transfer limitations in the fiber lumen and annular space. An attractive alternative to existing methodologies is to use the rate of solute removal or "washout" from the annular space during constant flow perfusion through the fiber lumen. Experimental washout curves were obtained for glucose and a 10 kD dextran in two different hollow fiber devices. Data were analyzed using a theoretical model which accounts for convective and diffusive transport in the lumen, membrane, and annular space. The model was in good agreement with the experimental results and provided an accurate measure of the effective membrane diffusion coefficient for both small and large solutes. This approach should prove useful in theoretical analyses of solute transport and performance of hollow fiber artificial organs.

TI  - Dual effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose tetraacetate upon glucose-induced insulin release.  
AB  - The effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose tetraacetate upon glucose-stimulated insulin release was explored in pancreatic islets from either normal or hereditary diabetic rats. At a high concentration (10 mM), it decreased the secretory response to D-glucose, such an inhibitory effect being more marked in the case of the alpha- than beta-anomer of the ester. At lower concentrations (0.19 to 1.7 mM), however, 2-deoxy-D-glucose tetraacetate augmented insulin secretion evoked by 8.3 mM D-glucose, with again a preference for the alpha-anomer of the ester. In relative terms, such an enhancing action was more marked in Goto-Kakizaki than normal rats. Hence, it is proposed that selected esters of non-nutrient carbohydrates could be used as insulinotropic tools in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Neonatal de-afferentation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves increases in vivo insulin sensitivity in conscious adult rats [see comments]  
AB  - Sensory neuropeptides, released from the peripheral nervous system, might modulate glucose homeostasis by antagonizing insulin action. The effects of de-afferentation of functional small diameter unmyelinated C-fibres (sensory nerves) on in vivo insulin-mediated intracellular glucose metabolism were investigated by using euglycaemic insulin (6 and 18 mU/kg x min) clamps with [3-(3)H]-glucose infusion in 24 adult rats, treated neonatally with either capsaicin (CAP) (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (CON). Following the clamp, skeletal muscle groups, liver and adipose tissue were freeze-clamped. At plasma insulin levels of approximately 90 mU/l, CAP-rats showed a 21% increase in whole body glucose uptake compared with CON (24.4 +/- 1.6 vs 20.1 +/- 0.8 mg/kg min, p < 0.02), which was paralleled by a 20% increase in whole body glycolysis (12.6 +/- 0.8 vs 10.5 +/- 0.5 mg/ kg.min p < 0.05) (concentration of 3H2O in plasma). Whole body skeletal muscle glycogenesis was increased by 80% in CAP-rats (5.7 +/- 0.7 vs 3.1 +/- 0.7 mg/kg x min, p < 0.05) with increased muscle glycogen synthase activity. Whole body (muscle, liver and adipose tissue combined) de novo lipogenesis also was increased in CAP-rats compared with CON (0.69 +/- 0.10 vs 0.44 +/- 0.06 mg/kg x min, p < 0.05) (incorporation of [3-(3)H]-glucose counts into glycogen or fat). Hepatic glucose production was lower in CAP-rats compared with CON (0.6 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 0.7 mg/kg x min, p < 0.05). Plasma glucagon, corticosterone, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were reduced in CAP-rats: 43 +/- 2 compared with 70 +/- 6 pg/ml, 855 +/- 55 compared with 1131 +/- 138 nmol/l, 513 +/- 136 compared with 1048 +/- 164 pmol/l and 928 +/- 142 compared with 1472 +/- 331 pmol/l, respectively, p < 0.05. At plasma insulin levels of approximately 400 mU/l, CAP-rats showed no differences in peripheral and hepatic insulin action compared with CON. We conclude that the removal of endogenous sensory neuropeptides, by de-afferentation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves, increases in vivo insulin sensitivity, but not responsiveness: 1) primarily through an increased sensitivity of skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis to insulin; 2) through a reduction in the levels of counter-regulatory hormones, thereby creating a milieu which favours overall in vivo insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose uptake, glucose production, glycolysis, glycogenesis and lipogenesis.

TI  - The cerebral metabolic effects of manipulating glutamatergic systems within the basal forebrain in conscious rats.  
AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor-mediated manipulations of the cortical cholinergic input arising from the basal forebrain differentially affect cognitive function. We used [14C]-2-deoxyglucose autoradiography in conscious rats to map the effects of excitatory amino acid agonist infusions into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) on cerebral functional activity, as reflected by local rates of glucose utilization. Acute stimulation of NBM neurones by local infusion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), 15 min before glucose use measurement, resulted in glucose use reductions in nine cortical regions innervated by NBM efferents including prefrontal, frontal, sensorimotor and cingulate cortices. NMDA infusions altered glucose use in two cortical areas. Both AMPA and NMDA markedly increased glucose use in the striatum and globus pallidus, with concomitant perturbations in striato-pallidal projection targets including the substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus and lateral habenular nucleus. In contrast, the GABAA agonist muscimol did not affect glucose use in the NBM or neocortical regions, but induced glucose use increases in several subcortical nuclei including the substantia nigra and entopeduncular nucleus. The delayed effects of excitotoxic lesions were assessed 3 weeks after basal forebrain infusions of AMPA, NMDA, ibotenate or quisqualate. Statistically significant glucose use changes only occurred in the hypothalamus after NMDA, and the NBM after ibotenate infusions, although reduced cortical metabolism was apparent following AMPA-induced lesions of the NBM. Results support a dissociation between the functional sequelae of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated events in the basal forebrain, and long-term compensatory functional adaptation following cortical denervation.

TI  - Inhibition of the oxidative and nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathways by somatostatin: a possible mechanism of antitumor action.  
AB  - Long-acting somatostatin analogs have recently become supplemental drugs in the treatment of neurofibroma because of their marked tumor growth inhibitory effect. Somatostatin is currently under extended evaluation in other cancers as a possible supplemental drug to the treatment protocols in use. The mode of action is not known. Somatostatin has been shown to cause glucose intolerance by inhibiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in fish liver. Recent data generated in our laboratory indicate that it is this pathway and the transketolase reactions of the pentose cycle (PC) which are directly involved in the ribose synthesis process of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. In cell culture, somatostatin alone inhibited glucose carbon recycling through the PC by 5.7%, which was increased to 19.8% in combination with oxythiamine, a competitive inhibitor of transketolase. Oxythiamine produced strong apoptosis in in-vitro hosted tumor cells. We hypothesize that somatostatin- and oxythiamine-induced antiproliferative action is mediated by the inhibition of G6PD, transketolase, or both.

The effect was more marked in cells incubated in glucose-free medium; 2) LND raised, to a remarkable extent, the intracellular content of DOX in resistant and sensitive cells respiring on endogenous substrates because of reduced ATP availability, whereas in glucose-supplemented medium, where both respiration and glycolysis contributed to ATP synthesis, the increase was lower; and 3) when LND was added to DOX-loaded cells, it failed to significantly inhibit DOX efflux because of time-dependent phenomena.

TI  - Enhancement of doxorubicin content by the antitumor drug lonidamine in resistant Ehrlich ascites tumor cells through modulation of energy metabolism.  
AB  - The effect of the antitumor drug lonidamine (LND) on respiration, aerobic glycolysis, adenylate pool, doxorubicin (DOX) uptake, and efflux in DOX-resistant and DOX-sensitive Ehrlich tumor cells was investigated. The results may be summarized as follows: 1) In both types of cells, LND inhibited both respiration and glycolysis in a dose-dependent manner and lowered the ATP concentration. The effect was more marked in cells incubated in glucose-free medium; 2) LND raised, to a remarkable extent, the intracellular content of DOX in resistant and sensitive cells respiring on endogenous substrates because of reduced ATP availability, whereas in glucose-supplemented medium, where both respiration and glycolysis contributed to ATP synthesis, the increase was lower; and 3) when LND was added to DOX-loaded cells, it failed to significantly inhibit DOX efflux because of time-dependent phenomena. These findings indicated that LND, a drug currently employed in tumor therapy, might also be useful in reducing or overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) of those cells with a reduced ability to accumulate and retain antitumor drugs.

TI  - Heart failure ketosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether blood ketone bodies are increased in congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Thirteen patients with CHF and 11 cardiac patients without CHF took part in the study. Blood acetoacetate and b-hydroxybutyrate levels and the pertinent metabolic and hormonal milieu were measured during 20 h fast and after 2 h glucose infusion. RESULTS: The averaged blood ketone body and free fatty acid levels were significantly higher during the fast and also remained higher after glucose infusion in patients with CHF than in the control group. The areas under ketone body concentration time curve over the last 8 h of the fast were 3522 +/- 662 mumol L-1 h-1 (SE) and 1789 +/- 192 mumol L-1 h-1 in patients with and without CHF, respectively (P = 0.022). Circulating noradrenaline and growth hormone were higher but glucagon lower in patients with CHF than in the controls (P < 0.05 for all differences) whereas the glucose and insulin concentrations were comparable in the study groups. At the time of peak ketonaemia the glucagon-to-insulin ratio was lower in patients with CHF than in patients without CHF (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that severe CHF is a ketosis-prone state. Augmented supply of free fatty acids for ketogenesis due to increased stress hormone-related lipolysis is one likely mechanism.

TI  - Mechanism of bacteriophage SfII-mediated serotype conversion in Shigella flexneri.  
AB  - We have isolated the lysogenic bacteriophage SfII, which mediates glucosylation of Shigella flexneri O-antigen, resulting in expression of the type II antigen. SfII belongs to group A of the Bradley classification and has a genome size of 42.3kb. DNA sequencing of a 4 kb BamHI subclone identified four open reading frames (ORFs), of which only two were found to be necessary for serotype conversion. These genes were named bgt, which encodes a putative bactoprenol glucosyl transferase, and gtrII, encoding the putative type II antigen determining glucosyl transferase. These genes are adjacent to the integrase gene (int) and attachment site (attP), which are highly homologous to those of Salmonella bacteriophage P22. Another ORF encoded a highly hydrophobic protein of 120 amino acids with homologues in Escherichia coli, Salmonella bacteriophage P22 and S. flexneri. Previous studies identified gtrX, the glucosyl transferase gene, of bacteriophage SfX, which also glucosylates the O-antigen specifically. We determined that gtrX-mediated expression of the group 7,8 antigen also requires bgt. This allowed us to identify gtrII as being the serotype antigen II determining glucosyl transferase. Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses indicated that bgt homologues exist in the genomes of all S. flexneri serotypes and in E. coli K-12, whereas gtrII was only detected in strains of serotype 2. Transposon TnphoA-derived chromosomal mutations of bgt and gtrII in S. flexneri serotype 2a were isolated and characterized. [35S]-methionine labelling and the use of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system identified a protein of 34kDa corresponding to Bgt. However, GtrII, which has a predicted molecular weight of 55 kDa, was not detected. We propose that the function of Bgt is to transfer the glucose residues from the UDP-glucose onto bactoprenol and GtrII then transfers the glucose onto the O-antigen repeat unit at the rhamnose III position. The chromosomal organization of these serotype-converting genes, when compared with their homologues in E. coli K-12 chromosome and the P22 bacteriophage genome, were very similar. This suggests that the regions encode similar functions in these organisms and have a similar evolutionary origin.

TI  - Genetic and biochemical evidence for distinct key functions of two highly divergent GAPDH genes in catabolic and anabolic carbon flow of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.  
AB  - Cyanobacterial genomes harbour two separate highly divergent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes, gap1 and gap2, which are closely related at the sequence level to the nuclear genes encoding cytosolic and chloroplast GAPDH of higher plants, respectively. Genes gap1 and gap2 of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were cloned and sequenced and subsequently inactivated by insertional mutagenesis to understand their metabolic functions. We obtained homozygous gap1- mutants which have lost the capacity to grow on glucose under dim light while growth on organic acids as well as photosynthetic growth under CO2 and high light is not impaired. Homozygous gap2- mutants show the reciprocal phenotype. Under dim light they only grow on glucose but not on organic acids nor do they survive under photosynthetic conditions. Measurements of the anabolic activities (reduction of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) in extracts from wild type and mutant cells show that Gap2 is a major enzyme with dual cosubstrate specificity for NAD and NADP, while Gap1 displays a minor NAD-specific GAPDH activity. However, if measured in the catabolic direction (oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) Gap2 activity is very low and increases three- to fivefold after gel filtration of extracts over Sephadex G25. Our results suggest that enzymes Gap1 and Gap2, although coexpressed in cyanobacterial wild-type cells, play distinct key roles in catabolic and anabolic carbon flow, respectively. While Gap2 operates in the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and in non-photosynthetic gluconeogenesis, Gap1 seems to be essential only for glycolytic glucose breakdown, conditions under which the catabolic activity of Gap2 seems to be repressed by a specific low-molecular-weight inhibitor.

TI  - Layer-by-layer construction of enzyme multilayers on an electrode for the preparation of glucose and lactate sensors: elimination of ascorbate interference by means of an ascorbate oxidase multilayer.  
AB  - A layer-by-layer structure of enzyme multilayers composed of glucose oxidase (GOx) or lactate oxidase (LOx) and ascorbate oxidase (AOx) was prepared on the surface of a platinum electrode. The amperometric response to glucose or lactate was studied in the presence of ascorbic acid as a possible interference. An alternating and repeated deposition of avidin and the biotin-labeled enzymes resulted in the layer-by-layer structure of GOx/AOx and LOx/AOx multilayers. Optical and gravimetric measurements based on an ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and a quartz crystal microbalance revealed that the enzyme multilayers thus prepared consist of monomolecular layers of the proteins. The GOx/AOx and LOx/AOx enzyme multilayers were useful to eliminate ascorbic acid interference in the glucose and lactate biosensors, because ascorbic acid can be converted to an electrochemically inert form, dehydroascorbic acid, before being oxidized directly on the Pt electrode. Thus, the GOx/AOx or LOx/AOx multilayer-modified biosensors can be used to determine the normal blood level of glucose (5 mM) and lactate (1 mM) in the presence of a physiological level of ascorbic acid (0.1 mM). The effects of the number of the AOx layers and geometry of the enzyme layers in the multilayer on the performance characteristics of the biosensors are discussed.

TI  - Multicenter study of oxygen-insensitive handheld glucose point-of-care testing in critical care/hospital/ambulatory patients in the United States and Canada.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Existing handheld glucose meters are glucose oxidase (GO)-based. Oxygen side reactions can introduce oxygen dependency, increase potential error, and limit clinical use. Our primary objectives were to: a) introduce a new glucose dehydrogenase (GD)-based electrochemical biosensor for point-of-care testing; b) determine the oxygen-sensitivity of GO- and GD-based electrochemical biosensor test strips; and c) evaluate the clinical performance of the new GD-based glucose meter system in critical care/hospital/ambulatory patients. DESIGN: Multicenter study sites compared glucose levels determined with GD-based biosensors to glucose levels determined in whole blood with a perchloric acid deproteinization hexokinase reference method. One site also studied GO-based biosensors and venous plasma glucose measured with a chemistry analyzer. Biosensor test strips were used with a handheld glucose monitoring system. Bench and clinical oxygen sensitivity, hematocrit effect, and precision were evaluated. SETTING: The study was performed at eight U.S. medical centers and one Canadian medical center. PATIENTS: There were 1,248 patients. RESULTS: The GO-based biosensor was oxygen-sensitive. The new GD-based biosensor was oxygen-insensitive. GD-based biosensor performance was acceptable: 2,104 (96.1%) of 2,189 glucose meter measurements were within +/-15 mg/dL (+/-0.83 mmol/L) for glucose levels of < or = 100 mg/dL (< or = 5.55 mmol/L) or within +/-15% for glucose levels of > 100 mg/dL, compared with the whole-blood reference method results. With the GD-based biosensor, the percentages of glucose measurements that were not within the error tolerance were comparable for different specimen types and clinical groups. Bracket predictive values were acceptable for glucose levels used in therapeutic management. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of GD-based, oxygen-insensitive, handheld glucose testing was technically suitable for arterial specimens in critical care patients, cord blood and heelstick specimens in neonates, and capillary and venous specimens in other patients. Multicenter findings benchmark the performance of bedside glucose testing devices. With the new +/-15 mg/dL --> 100 mg/dL --> +/-15% accuracy criterion, point-of-care systems for handheld glucose testing should score 95% (or better), as compared with the recommended reference method. Physiologic changes, preanalytical factors, confounding variables, and treatment goals must be taken into consideration when interpreting glucose results, especially in critically ill patients, for whom arterial blood glucose measurements will reflect systemic glucose levels.
