TI  - Raman spectroscopic and light-induced kinetic characterization of a recombinant phytochrome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis.  
AB  - A phytochrome-encoding cDNA from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into functional chromoproteins by incubation with either phycocyanobilin (PCB) or phytochromobilin (PPhiB). These materials were studied by Raman spectroscopy and nanosecond flash photolysis. The Raman spectra suggest far-reaching similarities in chromophore configuration and conformation between the Pfr forms of Synechocystis phytochrome and the plant phytochromes (e.g. phyA from oat), but some differences, such as torsions around methine bridges and in hydrogen bonding interactions, in the Pr state. Synechocystis phytochrome (PCB) undergoes a multistep photoconversion reminiscent of the phyA Pr --> Pfr transformation but with different kinetics. The first process resolved is the decay of an intermediate with red-shifted absorption (relative to parent state) and a 25-micros lifetime. The next observable intermediate grows in with 300 (+/-25) micros and decays with 6-8 ms. The final state (Pfr) is formed biexponentially (450 ms, 1 s). When reconstituted with PPhiB, the first decay of this Synechocystis phytochrome is biexponential (5 and 25 micros). The growth of the second intermediate is slower (750 micros) than that in the PCB adduct whereas the decays of both species are similar. The formation of the Pfr form required fitting with three components (350 ms, 2.5 s, and 11 s). H/D Exchange in Synechocystis phytochrome (PCB) delays, by an isotope effect of 2.7, both growth (300 micros) and decay rates (6-8 ms) of the second intermediate. This effect is larger than values determined for phyA (ca. 1.2) and is characteristic of a rate-limiting proton transfer. The formation of the Pfr state of the PCB adduct of Synechocystis phytochrome shows a deuterium effect similar as phyA (ca. 1.2). Activation energies of the second intermediate in the range 0-18 degrees C are 44 (in H2O/buffer) and 48 kJ mol-1 (D2O), with essentially identical pre-exponential factors.

TI  - Effects of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on neurite growth from adult sensory neurons in compartmented cultures.  
AB  - We used compartmented cultures to study the regulation of adult sensory neurite growth by neurotrophins. We examined the effects of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3), and BDNF on distal neurite elongation from adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Neurons were plated in the center compartments of three-chambered dishes in the absence of neurotrophin, and neurite extension into the distal (side) compartments containing NGF, BDNF, or NT3 was quantitated. Initial proximal neurite growth did not require any of the neurotrophins, while subsequent elongation into distal compartments required NGF. After neurites had extended into NGF-containing distal compartments, removal of NGF by treatment with anti-NGF resulted in the cessation of growth with minimal neurite retraction. In contrast to the effects of NGF, no distal neurite elongation was observed into compartments with BDNF or NT3. To examine possible additive influences, neurite extension into compartments containing BDNF plus NGF or NT3 plus NGF was quantitated. There was no increased neurite extension into NGF plus NT3 compartments, while the combination of BDNF plus NGF resulted in an inhibition of neurite extension compared with NGF alone. We then investigated whether the regrowth of neurites that had originally grown into NGF subsequent to in vitro axotomy still required NGF. The results demonstrated that unlike adult sensory nerve regeneration in vivo, the in vitro regrowth did require NGF, and neither BDNF nor NT3 was able to substitute for NGF. Since the initial growth from neurons after dissociation (which is also a regenerative response) did not require NGF, it would appear that neuritic growth and regrowth of adult DRG neurons in vitro includes both NGF-independent and NGF-dependent components. The compartmented culture system provides a unique model to further study aspects of this differential regulation of neurite growth.

TI  - Effect of arginine on toxin production by Clostridium difficile in defined medium.  
AB  - Twenty strains of Clostridium difficile were examined for the effect of arginine on toxin production in a defined medium. In three strains, the production of toxins A and B was greatly enhanced in the absence of arginine. These strains showed distinctively poorer growth in the absence of arginine in comparison with the remaining 17 strains, indicating that the presence of arginine is required for good growth among the three strains. From the present results, test strains were divided into two groups: a group in which arginine insufficiency caused distinctly poor growth and enhanced toxin production, and another group in which there was neither distinctly poor growth nor enhanced toxin production. The phenomenon is discussed in relation to the biosynthesis and catabolism of arginine.

TI  - Increased expression of midkine during the progression of human astrocytomas.  
AB  - Midkine (MK), a member of a new family of neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factors whose expression is developmentally regulated, is produced in fetal astrocytes. Malignant astrocytomas, one of the most neovascularized tumors, are derived from astrocytes. There has been no investigation of the expression of MK in human astrocytic tumors. To determine if increased levels of MK expression correlate with the progression of human astrocytomas, we examined surgical specimens of astrocytic tumors of various grades using Northern and Western blotting. MK mRNA and protein expression levels were higher in high-grade astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas) than in low-grade astrocytomas. As shown by in situ hybridization, MK mRNA expression was intense in a majority of glioblastoma cells but was weak in a small number of low-grade astrocytoma cells. These findings suggest that MK expression correlates with the malignant progression of astrocytomas. The aberrant MK expression in high-grade astrocytomas may underlie their rapid growth and well-vascularized features.

TI  - Gamma-heregulin: a novel heregulin isoform that is an autocrine growth factor for the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-175.  
AB  - A novel neuregulin isoform, termed gamma-HRG, was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-175. As observed with other neuregulins, gamma-HRG, is a product of alternative mRNA splicing of the neuregulin gene. Gamma-HRG contains the EGF-like and immunoglobulin-like domains that are commonly found in other family members, but lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. The new isoform possesses a unique N-terminal region that includes a hydrophobic domain that may function as a secretion signal. A purified recombinant version of gamma-HRG competes for binding to soluble ErbB3- and ErbB4-IgG fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for rHRGbeta1(177-244). Gamma-HRG has a wide distribution in mesenchymal or neuronal tissues but in contrast to other neuregulins, it is not present in breast, lung, liver and small intestine. Expression of gamma-HRG with its cognate receptors, ErbB3 and ErbB2 suggested that the growth of the MDA-MB-175 cell line might be a result of the autocrine stimulation of a growth factor signaling pathway. Treatment of MDA-MB-175 cells with an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody that interferes with the ligand-dependent formation of ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer complexes shows a strong growth inhibitory effect on this cell line. Moreover, incubation with a receptor-IgG fusion protein that neutralizes secreted gamma-HRG, also inhibits cell growth. These data suggest that the secretion of gamma-HRG by MDA-MB-175 cells leads to the formation of a constitutively active receptor complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an autocrine manner.

TI  - Embolotherapy of large pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: long-term results.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to document the long-term results of transcatheter embolotherapy of large pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). METHODS: From a data base of 221 consecutive patients with PAVMs treated by embolotherapy between 1978 and 1995, 45 patients with 52 PAVMs, supplied by feeding arteries 8 mm in diameter or larger, were selected for a retrospective investigation. RESULTS: Of 45 patients with 52 large PAVMs, 38 patients (84%) with 44 PAVMs (85%) were cured by the first embolotherapy (mean follow-up, 4.7 years). Acute periprocedural complications included self-limited pleurisy (31%), angina secondary to air embolus (2%), and paradoxical embolization of a device during deployment (4%). None of these events led to short- or long-term sequelae. Seven patients (16%) had persistence of the PAVM attributable to either recanalization (n = 4) or interim accessory artery growth (n = 3). Two of these patients presented with ischemic stroke several years after the initial treatment. Persistent PAVMs (n = 8) were retreated successfully by a second procedure (n = 7), or a third procedure (n = 1) (mean follow-up, 5.9 and 5.3 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Embolotherapy of large PAVMs results in permanent occlusion in an overwhelming majority of patients. Continued patency due to recanalization or accessory artery growth is easily detected and treated.

TI  - Evaluation of the clinical utility of the ultrasensitive immunofluometric assay for growth hormone (GH) and of the cortisol secretory pattern in prediction of the linear growth response to treatment with GH.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of an ultrasensitive IFMA for human 22 kDa GH in assessment of GH secretion and prediction of the linear growth response to exogenous GH. METHODS: Utilizing Delfia reagents supplied by Wallac-OY, an ultrasensitive IFMA for GH was established. Serum GH concentrations from 15 children/adolescents undergoing 24 hour GH secretory profiles with sampling at 20 minute intervals were analyzed by both IFMA and RIA. Cortisol values were also measured. Twelve children were later treated with GH. The 24 hour GH and cortisol secretory profiles were analyzed by the Cluster program and the relationships of these profiles to the linear growth response to exogenous GH determined. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the IFMA for GH relative to a zero standard was 0.005 ng/ml; intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 12% at a GH concentration of 0.005 ng/ml to 4% at 0.038 ng/ml; interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 34% at a GH concentration of 0.005 ng/ml to 10.5% at 2.7 ng/ml and to 2.7% at 12.7 ng/ml. Above assay sensitivity, there was good correlation between GH concentrations determined by IFMA and those by IRMA and RIA (r = 0.998 and 0.992 respectively). The number of GH secretory peaks identified by IFMA was significantly greater than that detected by RIA (10.6 +/- 3.2 [SD] vs 6.7 +/- 3.3/24 hours, p = 0.0001 by paired t-test). There were few significant relationships between any parameter of GH secretion measured by RIA or IFMA (peak GH pulse amplitude, percent increase in amplitude, area under the peak, interpeak interval) and the pretreatment growth rate, the growth velocity while receiving GH therapy, or the increment in growth rate during administration of GH. The number of GH secretory peaks determined by RIA correlated weakly with the pretreatment growth rate. There was no meaningful relationship between the serum concentrations of cortisol and GH-IFMA. Peak GH concentrations and nadir cortisol values were exactly coincident in 15.7% (25/159); 42.8% of nadir cortisol values coincided with or were within +/- 20 minutes of peak GH values (68/159). However, there was no relationship between the number of cortisol secretory peaks, the pooled 24 hour and nocturnal concentrations of cortisol and the pretreatment growth velocity, the growth rate or increment in growth velocity during administration of GH. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased sensitivity of the IFMA and its ability to detect pulsatile GH secretion heretofore unidentified, data from this GH assay were not useful in predicting first year growth rate during administration of GH. The secretory pattern of cortisol was not helpful in predicting the growth response to GH.

TI  - Effect of growth rate and body mass on resting metabolic rate in galliform chicks.  
AB  - In this study, we asked whether within-species variation in chick resting metabolic rate was related to variation in growth and whether this relationship changed during development in three galliform species (turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, guinea fowl, Numida meleagris, and Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica). Resting metabolic rate increased by a bi- or triphasic pattern with body mass. For each phase, the relationship between metabolic rate and growth was studied by residual analysis, with two measures of growth: growth rate and body mass. Chick mass reflects the net result of accumulated growth, while hatchling mass reflects embryonic growth. In hatchlings, high metabolic rates coincided with low growth rates in turkeys and guinea fowl. These species delay initial food intake, and under these circumstances high metabolic expenditure may preclude conversion of yolk energy into body mass. No relationship was present between residual hatching metabolic rate and residual body mass. In older chicks, residual metabolic rate was positively linearly related with residual growth rate (turkeys and young quail) or residual body mass (guinea fowl and older quail). The similarity of the slopes suggests that growth rate and accumulated growth affected maintenance metabolism to the same extent throughout development. These findings suggest that growth models must take ontogenetic adjustments of metabolic rate into account in addition to costs of maintenance.

TI  - The induction of immune responses to murine malignant mesothelioma by IL-2 gene transfer.  
AB  - Stable IL-2 transfectant clones have been derived from two non-immunogenic murine malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines to investigate the induction of protective antitumor immunity to MM. AC29-IL-2 transfectant clones grew at a slower rate in vivo than the parental cell line or a transfectant control clone but all inoculated mice developed tumours despite the continued ability of the tumour cells to express IL-2. Tumour development after inoculation of AB1-IL-2 transfectants varied, the degree of in vivo inhibition (40-100%) being directly related to the rate of IL-2 secretion of the transfectants. When mice which had rejected the AB1-IL-2 transfectants were challenged with parental AB1 cells, a proportion (16-70%) of mice from each group remained tumour free at least 45 days after challenge (naive mice developed tumours within 26 days). The inhibition of growth of the initial inoculum of AB1-IL-2 transfectants was independent of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, consistent with the demonstration of non-specific cytotoxic activity by splenocytes from mice inoculated with the IL-2 transfectants. These data suggest that IL-2 expression by MM cells is capable of generating in vivo immunity to the tumour. This immunity may be relatively weak or may be subject to down-regulation so that consistent rejection of unmodified tumour cells is not achieved. Genetic modification with combinations of genes, including IL-2 and B7-1, will be necessary for reliable generation of protective immunity to MM.

TI  - Effects of high glucose on vascular endothelial growth factor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.  
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in addition oto its growth-promoting effects on endothelial cells, can also increase vascular permeability and monocyte migration. It has therefore been implicated in the pathogenic neovascularization associated with diabetic retinopathy and atherosclerosis. However, the factors regulating VEGF expression in the vascular wall are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the regulation of VEGF expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by hyperglycemia as well as by angiotensin II (ANG II). We also examined whether the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) can alter VEGF expression, since 12-LO products of arachidonic acid have angiogenic properties, and ANG II as well as high glucose (HG, 25 mM) can increase 12-LO activity and expression in VSMC. Studies were carried out in human (HSMC) or porcine VSMC (PSMC), which were cultured for at least two passages under normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mM) or HG conditions. HG culture alone increased the expression of VEGF mRNA and protein in both HSMC and PSMC. Furthermore, ANG II treatment significantly induced VEGF mRNA and protein expression only in VSMC cultured in HG and not NG. In addition, 12-HETE significantly increased VEGF mRNA and protein expression in HSMC cultured in NG as well as in HG. Cells cultured in HG also secreted significantly greater amounts of VEGF into the culture medium. These results suggest that elevated VEGF production under HG conditions may play a role in the accelerated vascular disease observed in diabetes.

TI  - Role of lipoproteins in the delivery of lipids to axons during axonal regeneration.  
AB  - Nerve fiber elongation involves the input of lipids to the growing axons. Since cell bodies are often a great distance from the regenerating tips, alternative sources of lipids have been proposed. We previously demonstrated that axonal synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is required for axonal growth (Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 913-918; Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) Biochem. J. 312, 411-417). In contrast, cholesterol is not made in axons. We now show that when compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons are incubated with pravastatin, in the absence of exogenously supplied lipids, cholesterol synthesis is inhibited and axonal growth is impaired. The addition of cholesterol to the axons or cell bodies of neurons treated with this inhibitor restores normal axonal elongation. Similarly, a supply of cholesterol via lipoproteins restores normal axonal growth. In contrast, lipoproteins do not provide axons with sufficient phosphatidylcholine for normal elongation when axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis is inhibited. Thus, our studies support the idea that during axonal regeneration lipoproteins can be taken up by axons from the microenvironment and supply sufficient cholesterol, but not phosphatidylcholine, for growth. We also show that neither apoE nor apoA-I within the lipoproteins is essential for axonal growth.

TI  - Radiation sensitivity of human hair follicles in SCID-hu mice.  
AB  - We developed an experimental model for studying the growth and epilation of the human hair follicle by implanting human scalp tissue onto immunodeficient C.B-17 scid/scid mice. The skin grafts showed continuous growth of black human hairs for at least 1 year and maintained the normal histological structure of a human hair follicle and other tissues associated with the skin. Using this in vivo model, we evaluated the effect of irradiation on the function of human hair follicles. Localized X irradiation (1 to 6 Gy) induced hair loss dose-dependently and synchronously in the third week after irradiation. The hairs undergoing epilation showed a gradual decrease in width toward the root. The minimum width at the thinnest portion of the surviving hair 4 weeks after irradiation suggested that epilation resulted from the breaking of hairs when the hair width decreased to less than 20 microm. After the highest-dose irradiation, the normal structure of the hair bulb was totally abrogated, and long and narrow epithelial tissues associated with regressed papillary cells remained. The surviving epithelia were morphologically similar to the outer epithelial sheath of the follicle associated with palisadic basal cell layers. In the third week some cells in the basal layers of the surviving epithelium in each follicle expressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen. By about 9 weeks after irradiation, the complete structure of the follicle regenerated, with hair growth activity even in the grafts irradiated at the highest dose, although about 30% of the hairs did not regrow. These findings suggest that follicular stem cells that survive high-dose exposure in the sheath-like epithelial tissue can reproduce the complete follicle structure. This animal model can be used to assess the effects of radiation exposure on human skin and to identify and characterize human follicular stem cells.

TI  - Two intracellular signaling pathways for activation of protein kinase C are involved in oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced macrophage growth.  
AB  - Recent studies demonstrated that oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) induces macrophage growth in vitro. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways for macrophage growth. Ox-LDL initiated a rapid and transient rise in intracellular free calcium ion and induced activation of membrane protein kinase C (PKC). Pertussis toxin completely inhibited the Ox-LDL-induced rise in free calcium ion and significantly inhibited macrophage growth by 50%. Moreover, PKC inhibitors calphostin C and H-7 significantly inhibited Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth by 80%. On the other hand, phospholipase A2-treated acetylated LDL did not induce a rise in calcium but significantly activated PKC and led to significant macrophage growth that was significantly inhibited by calphostin C by 90%. These results suggest the presence of two intracellular signaling pathways for activation of PKC, a rise in calcium that was mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and the internalization of lysophosphatidylcholine through the scavenger receptors. These two pathways may play an important role in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth.

TI  - Regulation of RAR beta expression by RAR- and RXR-selective retinoids in human lung cancer cell lines: effect on growth inhibition and apoptosis induction.  
AB  - Retinoids regulate the growth and differentiation of human tracheobronchial epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) and receptor class-selective retinoids on the growth and apoptosis of human lung cancer cell lines. Trans-RA significantly inhibited the growth of Calu-6 and H460 cells, accompanied by induction of RA receptor (RAR) beta expression. In contrast, it had little effect on the growth of H292, SK-MES-1 and H661 lung cancer cell lines, in which RAR beta expression was not induced. Stable expression of RAR beta in RAR beta-negative, trans-RA-resistant SK-MES-1 and H661 lung cancer cells led to recovery of trans-RA-induced growth inhibition, which occurred, however, only at low serum concentration. Using fluorescent microscopy and the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) assay, we demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by trans-RA contributed to its growth-inhibitory effect in trans-RA-sensitive lung cancer cell lines. Analysis of RAR-selective and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retionoids showed that activation of both RARs and RXRs could induce growth inhibition in trans-RA-sensitive lung cancer cells. Also, an additive synergistic effect on growth inhibition and RAR beta induction was observed when cells were treated with combinations of RAR-selective and RXR-selective retinoids. Together, our results show that expression of RAR beta plays a role in mediating retinoid response in lung cancer cells and that activation of RARs or RXRs contributes to induction of RAR beta, growth inhibition and apoptosis by retinoids.

TI  - Optical and structural development of the crystalline lens in childhood.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To document the development of key optical and structural parameters of the crystalline lens throughout childhood and examine possible mechanisms by which lens power remains coordinated with the growth of the eye to maintain emmetropia. METHODS: Using cycloplegic autorefraction, video-based phakometry, and ultrasonography, the authors measured refractive error and crystalline lens parameters in 994 children in the first through eighth grades, who participated in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia, between one and five times from 1989 through 1993.  Polynomial growth curves were fit to the data by maximum likelihood estimation. The average annual rates of change in each parameter from each subject's longitudinal data were also estimated. RESULTS: The lens radii of curvature flattened throughout childhood, yet decreases in lens equivalent power stopped after 10 years of age. This indicates that the refractive index of the lens increased during later childhood. Lens thinning in early childhood also ceased after 10 years of age. The spherical volume of the lens showed no appreciable net increase, but the axial length of the eye continued to grow throughout childhood. The prevalence of myopia in our data increased sharply at age 10 years, reaching 21.3% by the age of 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent thinning and flattening of the crystalline lens imply that the lens is mechanically stretched by the equatorial growth of the eye during childhood. Changes in the patterns of lens development near the age of 10 years, concurrent with the onset of myopia, suggest that forces arise which interfere with equatorial growth. Such forces might diminish the decreases in lens power and amplify axial elongation to promote myopia.

TI  - The CXC receptor 2 is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis.  
AB  - The CXC chemokines interleukin-8 and GRO/melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (GRO-alpha) are potent activators of neutrophils and lymphocytes, but also stimulate growth and differentiation of nonhematopoietic cells like keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes. High mRNA and protein levels have been detected in psoriatic epidermis. Chemokine activation of target cells is mediated by specific receptors and two CXC receptors have been described with similar affinity for interleukin-8 but different affinities for GRO-alpha. In this study, we examined the expression of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 in psoriatic tissue, identifying the target cells of chemokine activation in psoriasis. By immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, as confirmed by northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we could detect expression of the CXCR2 in suprabasal lesional psoriatic keratinocytes but not in healthy skin. The CXCR1 could not be localized in psoriatic keratinocytes with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, but infiltrating cells in the dermal compartment expressed both types of receptors. These data suggest that in addition to neutrophil activation by both CXCR1 and CXCR2, activation of keratinocytes mediated by CXCR2 could contribute to the characteristic epidermal changes observed in psoriasis.

TI  - Characterization of the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase gene from Candida albicans.  
AB  - Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to D-ribose-5-phosphate during the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and tryptophan and histidine biosynthesis in a variety of organisms. We cloned and sequenced the PRPP synthetase gene (PRS1) of Candida albicans because, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a deficiency in PRPP synthetase activity interacts with a mutation in ELM4-1 (elongated morphology) to cause constitutive pseudohyphal growth in nitrogen-rich media. In order to study the role of the C. albicans PRS1 in growth and morphogenesis, we used gene disruption to isolate PRS1 mutants; however, while heterozygous PRS1 clones were readily obtained, homozygous, null strains were not recovered indicating that PRS1 is probably essential for growth of the organism. Heterozygotes in PRS1 produced approximately 35% less PRPP synthetase (P = 0.0004) and exhibited a similar reduction in transcript levels. Confirmation of a heterozygous, single disruption in PRS1 was obtained by I-SceI digestion of chromosomal-sized DNA and Southern blot hybridizations. While no role in morphogenesis is elucidated by this work, the data strongly suggests that PRS1 is an essential gene in C. albicans and supports earlier results that indicated the presence of a single PRS gene in C. albicans.

TI  - Guinea pig auditory nerve response triggered by a high density electrode array.  
AB  - The electrically evoked potential in the auditory nerve is measured when the cochlear is stimulated with a high density electrode array whose microcontacts (20 x 160 microns) are placed close to the nerve cells. Threshold range from 8 to 35 microA with the stimulating electrodes near the spiral ganglion cells. A multi-pole technique for restricting the spread of current with electrical stimulation of the cochlea is tested using neural recording in deafened guinea pigs. The ground based quadrupolar electrode driving configuration has thresholds for neural activation only slightly greater than monopolar stimulation when the electrode contacts are placed less than 50 microns from the neurons. During simultaneous stimulation the monopole and the ground based quadrupolar modes tend to generate similar growth functions (magnitude and latency). The electrode interactions are generally factorial, which means that the algebraic sum of the responses (magnitude growth functions) produced by 2 distinct electrodes is less than when the same 2 electrodes are stimulated simultaneously.

TI  - [Transvaginal ultrasound biometry in early pregnancy--a growth model]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of a growth model for the biometric parameters of early pregnancy: Chorionic cavity, yolk sac, amniotic cavity, crown-rump length and biparietal diameter. METHOD: 618 clinically well-dated singleton pregnancies of the first trimester were measured in a prospective cross-sectional study with high-frequency transvaginal ultrasound between 28 and 94 days post menstruation. RESULTS: Normal curves (5th, 50th, 95th percentiles) for all parameters were established using our growth model. The growth curves of chorionic cavity amniotic cavity, and biparietal diameter showed a linear growth whereas the growth curve of the crown-rump-length represented an exponential curve.  Linear growth of the yolk sac was found until 8 weeks of gestation and there was no growth alteration after this time. CONCLUSION: With our growth curves of the first trimester it is possible to monitor the embryonic development with several parameters.

TI  - The effects of a fluoroquinolone on the growth and development of infants.  
AB  - Growth and development were monitored for up to 42 months in nine neonates to whom ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, was given in the neonatal period at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day. Ciprofloxacin was used only as a 'life-saving' therapy in cases of sepsis produced by bacterial agents resistant to other antibiotics. Two other groups of nine neonates, matched by birth weight and gestational age, were studied as controls: one group with sepsis, which was effectively treated with cefotaxime and a group of healthy neonates. No statistically significant differences in growth and development between the groups were found during follow-up for 42 months. No osteoarticular problems or joint deformities were observed in the ciprofloxacin group. Ciprofloxacin appears to provide a therapeutic option as a 'life-saving' therapy for newborns with sepsis produced by multiply resistant organisms.

Concentrations of oxalate and glycosaminoglycans and AP(CaOx) index, an estimate of the CaOx ion-activity product, were higher and the concentration of citrate lower in NM than in NW. In SFM the directly assessed risk of CaOx crystallization was higher and the inhibition of CaOx crystal growth lower than in NM. There were no differences between the groups regarding inhibition of CaOx crystal growth by 74% dialysed urine or inhibition of CaOx crystal aggregation. SFM with mixed CaOxCaP stones had a higher concentration of phosphate and a higher AP(CaP) index at pH 7.0 than SFM with CaOx stones.

TI  - A Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant defective in the kinesin-like protein Kar3 is sensitive to NaCl-stress.  
AB  - Several mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing poor growth in the presence of elevated concentrations of NaCl were isolated to identify genes involved in the osmo-stress response. One of these mutants (WAY.5-4A-11; osr11) which showed a clear 2:2 segregation of the salt-stress phenotype upon tetrad analysis when crossed to a wild-type strain has been characterised. The mutation responsible for poor growth under salt-stress was recessive. The corresponding gene was cloned by complementation of the mutant phenotype and a 3.5-kb fragment was isolated. The sequence of this fragment matched that of KAR3, a gene previously identified to be involved in karyogamy and mitosis. Allelism of OSR11 to KAR3 was confirmed by tetrad analysis, and disruption mutants showed the same NaCl-phenotype as the original osr11 mutation. The disruption mutant was more sensitive to high sucrose concentrations than the original mutant was to high glucose concentrations. In a different genetic background (W303-1A), the kar3 disruptants were less sensitive to osmo-stress than the WAY.5-4A strain. Heat-stress, nitrogen-starvation and cultivation on ethanol failed to affect the growth of osr11 and kar3 mutants, pointing to a possible specific involvement of KAR3 in the osmotic-stress response. Microscopic studies showed that cell division of the kar3 mutants was impaired and NaCl-stress conditions aggravated the phenotype.

TI  - Physiological changes in extracellular sodium directly control human proximal tubule growth and transport.  
AB  - In order to examine the nature and potential mechanisms of action of extracellular sodium on human proximal tubule growth and transport, quiescent primary cultures of human proximal tubule cells (PTC) were incubated for 24 h in serum-free, growth-factor-free culture media containing low (130 mmol/l), control (140 mmol/l) or high (150 mmol/l) Na+. Compared to control conditions, cells exposed to a high Na+ concentration demonstrated stimulated thymidine incorporation (121.8 +/- 7.6%, P < 0.05) and increased cellular protein content (139.7 +/- 9.9%, P < 0.05); the latter arising from suppressed protein degradation ([3H]valine release 72.3 +/- 2.5%, P < 0.01) and unchanged protein synthesis ([3H]valine incorporation 98.5 +/- 2.6%, P > 0.1). Substitution of choline chloride for NaCl did not replicate these effects. Conversely, cells incubated in low-Na+ media showed reduced thymidine incorporation (77.2 +/- 4.4%, P < 0. 05), reduced protein synthesis (60.6 +/- 4.3%, P < 0.01), reduced protein degradation (79.5 +/- 1.8%, P < 0.01) and an unaltered protein content (102.4 +/- 8.8%). A role for apical Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) activity in mediating Na+-dependent alterations in PTC growth was suggested by the findings of increased apical, ethylisopropylamiloride- (EIPA)-sensitive 22Na+ uptake in the presence of a high Na+ concentration (159 +/- 19% of control, P < 0. 05) and concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular growth by EIPA at levels corresponding to those producing inhibition of apical NHE. Conditioned media from low Na+, control or high Na+ PTC contained comparable amounts of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (1. 19 +/- 0.23, 1.14 +/- 0.22 and 1.28 +/- 0.20 ng/mg protein, P > 0.1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (1.76 +/- 0.32, 1.73 +/- 0.33 and 1.45 +/- 0.28 ng/mg protein, P > 0.1), and did not exhibit autocrine growth factor activity on separate PTC following adjustment of Na+ concentrations to 140 mmol/l by dialysis. Similarly, low-Na+, control or high-Na+ media did not modify the mitogenic responsiveness of PTC to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or alter the affinity or number of PTC IGF-I binding sites. The results confirm that physiological increases in extracellular Na+ concentration directly stimulate human proximal tubule growth and Na+ transport. Such stimulation does not appear to be mediated by altered PTC secretion of, or responsiveness to, cytokines known to affect tubule growth and transport.

TI  - Morphologic characteristics of endometriosis in the mouse model: application to toxicology.  
AB  - Surgically induced endometriosis in the mouse has been described as a model to investigate the effect of environmental pollutants on the growth of endometriotic implants. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a modified surgical procedure to induce endometriosis and validate the model by comparing the effects of estrogen, 4-chlorodiphenyl ether (4-CDE) as a possible estrogenic contaminant, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a contaminant with predominantly anti-estrogenic activities, on the growth of endometrial implants. Uterine strips (1.0 x 4.0 mm2) were autotransplanted to multiple sites in the abdomen of sexually mature female B6C3F1 mice (n = 33), which were randomly assigned to the following groups: intact control (n = 4); ovariectomized (OVX, n = 9); OVX and treated with 4-CDE (n = 6); OVX and treated with 17 beta-estradiol (E2, n = 9); and OVX and treated with E2 plus TCDD (n = 5). Endometrial implants survived warm ischemia regardless of implant site and appeared as small clear spherical or ovoid fluid-filled cysts. The diameter of the endometrial cysts in the OVX animals was significantly (p < 0.0001) smaller compared with the intact animals and OVX animals replaced with E2 or 4-CDE. In contrast, TCDD treatment inhibited the growth of endometrial cysts in the presence of estrogen. We conclude that autotransplantation of uterine slices to multiple abdominal sites results in formation of endometriotic cysts that are responsive to estrogen, and that environmental contaminants possess the potential to affect the survival and growth of endometrial cysts. Therefore, we concluded that the mouse endometriosis model described in this paper has applications to investigate the possible role of environmental pollutants in the development of endometriosis.

TI  - Growth-independent regulation of CLN3 mRNA levels by nutrients in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells regulate progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to nutrients, moving quickly through G1 in rich medium and slowly in poor medium. Recent work has shown that the levels of Cln3 protein, a G1 cyclin, are low in cells growing in poor medium and high in cells growing rapidly in rich medium, consistent with the previously recognized role of Cln3 in promoting passage through Start. Cln3 protein levels appear to be regulated both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. We have worked to define the nutrient signals that regulate CLN3 mRNA levels. We find that CLN3 mRNA levels are high during log-phase growth in glucose medium, low in postdiauxic cells growing on ethanol, and slightly lower still in cells in stationary phase. CLN3 mRNA levels are induced by glucose in a process that involves transcriptional control, requires metabolism of the glucose, and is independent of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway. CLN3 mRNA levels are also positively regulated by nitrogen sources, but phosphorus and sulfur limitation do not affect CLN3 message levels.

TI  - Growth and nutrient intake in three- to twelve-month-old infants fed human milk or formulas with varying protein concentrations.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results on growth and nutrient intake in infants in the second half of infancy fed human milk or formulas with varying protein concentrations in combination with supplementary foods have not previously been reported. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy infants were studied from 3 to 12 months of age. They were exclusively breast-fed until 3 months and were then randomly assigned to one of three feeding groups, F13, F15, or F18, indicating formulas with 13, 15 or 18 g/l of protein, respectively. Formula was gradually introduced when breast-feeding was terminated. Infants fed breast milk only were included in the breast-fed group, and those with breast milk and formula were included in the mixed-fed group. The same supplementary foods were provided to all infants. RESULTS: There were no differences in growth between the feeding groups. Total protein intake exceeded minimum recommendations in all groups at all ages and was higher at 6 months in F18 than in F13 (2.3 vs. 1.9 g/kg per day; p < 0.01), whereas formula protein intake was higher at all ages in F18 compared with F13. Intake of protein from supplementary foods increased, but that from formula decreased between 6 and 12 months in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of breast milk or infant formula with 13 g/l of protein along with high-protein supplementary foods provided enough protein with no adverse effect on growth. Infants fed formulas with higher protein concentrations had similar growth, despite higher intakes of formula protein.

TI  - Combined inhibitory effect of fluoride and hypothiocyanite on the viability and glucose metabolism of Streptococcus mutans, serotype c.  
AB  - The separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (HOSCN/OSCN-) and F- ions on glucose uptake and growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were investigated. S. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mM D-glucose. This saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microM H2O2 at pH 5.0 or 6.5. At pH 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microM HOSCN/OSCN- was generated. After 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to HOSCN/OSCN- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. Identical experiments were made with F- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM). Both HOSCN/OSCN- and F- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at pH 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at pH 6.5. When F- and HOSCN/OSCN- were added simultaneously at pH 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. In glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microM HOSCN/OSCN-, 0.5 mM F- or both. F-, HOSCN/OSCN- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at pH 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. These observations indicate that F- and HOSCN/OSCN- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on S. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

TI  - Birth outcome from a prospective, matched study of prenatal crack/cocaine use: I. Interactive and dose effects on health and growth.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, longitudinal project was designed to determine the effects of prenatal cocaine use on the pregnancy outcomes of women from a historically understudied rural public health population. METHODOLOGY: We interviewed over 2500 women prenatally, identified 154 cocaine users, and matched 154 controls on race, parity, socioeconomic status, and location of prenatal care (that related to level of pregnancy risk). Drug testing was required at enrollment and at delivery; detailed demographic, psychosocial, and drug histories were taken at each available trimester and follow-up visit. After birth, neonatal nurse practitioners, blinded to maternal history of drug use, examined infants to assess gestational age and take growth measurements. Medical charts were reviewed and the Hobel Risk Scale was completed. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the cocaine users had significantly higher Hobel Prenatal and Total Risk Scores and more preterm infants (28 vs 14), but not a significantly greater number of fetal deaths (3 vs 1). After controlling for the effects of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use, the following results remained. There was no difference in gestational age, Ponderal Index, birth weight, or length between infants born to cocaine users and controls. There was a significant interaction effect such that infant head and chest circumference were smaller in cocaine users who also smoked tobacco. Significant correlation coefficients demonstrated the effects of the amount of drug usage on fetal growth during each trimester of pregnancy. The average cocaine use per day for trimesters one and three and for the entire pregnancy was negatively related to birth length. The mean amounts used in trimesters two and three were negatively related to head circumference. Amounts of tobacco and alcohol use in pregnancy were also inversely related to fetal growth measures. When the effects of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco were partialed out, there continued to be a negative relationship between the amount of cocaine used in the third trimester and infant length and head circumference. CONCLUSIONS: The observed decrement in fetal growth, especially head circumference, among cocaine-exposed neonates raises concerns about later growth and development. Follow-up of these infants will reveal if these disadvantages continue. These early results also emphasize the importance of considering amount and time of drug exposure as well as the interactive effects of drug exposure and other risk variables.

TI  - H441 pulmonary epithelial cell mitogenic effects and signaling pathways in response to HGF and TGF-alpha.  
AB  - Pulmonary epithelial cells are important in lung growth, development, and injury. H441 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells may be a useful model for studying pulmonary epithelial cell growth factor responses in vitro. Isolated pulmonary epithelial type II cells proliferate in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha via the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Type II cells also proliferate in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In the present study, H441 cell responses to these growth factors were examined, and compared to type II cells. Both the EGF-R and the c-met proto-oncogene receptor, to which HGF binds, were immunoprecipitated from H441 cells. In H441 cells, addition of TGF-alpha resulted in phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and increased cell number and tritiated thymidine incorporation. Incubation with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of its c-met proto-oncogene receptor in type II and H441 cells, and also increased cell number and tritiated thymidine incorporation. Both HGF and TGF-alpha stimulated phosphorylation of the intracellular signaling molecules p42 and p44 mitogen activated protein kinases in H441 cells. H441 cells exhibited responses to mitogenic growth factors similar to type II cells and may be useful as a model for type II cell growth factor responses and signal transduction.

TI  - Contribution of human uropontin to inhibition of calcium oxalate crystallization.  
AB  - Uropontin (UP) is known to inhibit the growth and nucleation of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, and it also impedes attachment of calcium oxalate crystals to cultured renal epithelial cells. However, its role in normal defense against renal crystallization, and in pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis is unclear. In this study we determined the effect of UP on aggregation of COM crystals as well as the inhibitory activity of UP on COM crystal growth and nucleation in a series of normal subjects, in order to assess the potential of UP as an important urinary inhibitor. The mean urinary excretion of UP measured by ELISA was 185 +/- 12 nmol/24 hr (mean +/- SEM) with a mean urine UP concentration of 131 +/- 13 nM. Uropontin isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography was a very potent inhibitor of COM crystal aggregation, with a mean UP concentration of 28 +/- 4 nM required for a 50% reduction in aggregation. The kDa for COM crystal growth inhibition determined from Langmuir type isotherms was 21 +/- 3 nM and the concentration required for 50% reduction in COM crystal growth rate was 16 +/- 2 nM. Inhibition of secondary nucleation was measured at a single concentration of 200 nM, which reduced the nucleation rate to 42 +/- 3% of control. Using a theoretical model of growth and aggregation inhibition at varying urine flow rates, we showed that inhibitory activity of UP would be significant for all subjects over a wide range of urine flow rates. Overall, UP is a potent inhibitor of COM aggregation as well as growth and nucleation. The urinary concentration of UP is in the range in which its contribution to inhibition of growth and aggregation are likely to be substantial. Thus, UP appears to be an important natural defense against renal crystallizations and nephrolithiasis.

A dose of < or = 160 mg/kg of 3-CPA did not show any notable extrapyramidal symptoms which was observed for neutral MCA treated mice at the dose of 20 mg/kg. The lethal response dose of 3-CPA for scid mice was 320 mg/kg which is 4 times higher than that determined for neutral MCA (80 mg/kg). These results support 3-CPA as a good candidate drug representing a new generation of benzamides for further clinical development as a cancer therapy drug.

TI  - Long [R3] insulin-like growth factor-I reduces growth, plasma growth hormone, IGF binding protein-3 and endogenous IGF-I concentrations in pigs.  
AB  - Growth hormone (GH) improves growth performance in the pig. Analogues of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) that bind poorly to IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) stimulate growth in the rat but, in contrast, inhibit growth in the pig. This study was designed to determine the effect of IGF peptides alone or in combination with porcine GH (pGH) on growth characteristics and plasma hormone concentrations in finisher pigs. A four-day infusion of Long [R3] IGF-I (LR3IGF-I; 180 micrograms/kg/day) decreased the average daily gain, food intake, and plasma IGFBP-3, IGF-I and insulin concentrations. The mean plasma GH concentration was decreased by 23% and the area under the GH peaks was reduced by 60%. Co-administration of pGH (30 micrograms/kg/day) with LR3IGF-I had no interactive effect on growth performance, and plasma insulin, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I concentrations remained suppressed. The area under the GH peaks was not restored with this combination treatment although mean plasma GH concentrations were elevated in all animals receiving pGH. Infusion of IGF-I (180 micrograms/kg/day) decreased plasma insulin and mean GH concentrations but had no significant effect on IGFBP-3 concentrations. Average daily gain and feed intake were not changed by IGF-I treatment. A combination of IGF-I and pGH injection (30 micrograms/kg/day) increased plasma IGFBP-3 concentrations but plasma insulin levels remained suppressed. Plasma glucose levels were unaffected by any treatment. The study demonstrates that both IGF-I and LR3IGF-I suppress plasma GH concentrations in finisher pigs. This, in turn, may be responsible for the reduction in the plasma concentration of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and insulin seen in LR3IGF-I-treated animals. The decrease in these parameters may contribute to the inhibitory effect of LR3IGF-I on growth performance in the pig.

The remaining upper incisor showed deviation towards the opposite side, and there was regular dental wear of all the incisors. The effects were evident only in the mid-facial area. Cephalometric measurements showed significant shortening with deviation of the incisor bone on the extraction side. There was no significant disturbance of the growth of the rest of the maxilla and mandible. These results indicate that upper incisor extractions have a localized influence, leading to impairment of incisor bone growth.

TI  - Interleukin-10 inhibits the autocrine growth of leukemic blast cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia.  
AB  - The effect of interleukin-10 (IL-10) on the growth of leukemic blast cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is in need of clarification. We therefore examined the effect of IL-10 on AML cells obtained from 10 patients. Although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was able to stimulate the growth of AML progenitor cells to form leukemic blast colonies, IL-10 itself demonstrated no leukemic blast colony-forming activity and no synergistic stimulating activity with other cytokines. However, leukemic blast colonies were formed without the addition of exogenous cytokines in four cases and IL-10 suppressed these spontaneous colony formations in two of the four cases. Since the production of G-CSF and GM-CSF was observed in these two cases, the presence of an autocrine growth mechanism mediated by these cytokines was suggested. When serial concentrations of IL-10 were added, the production of G-CSF and GM-CSF was dramatically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that IL-10 could suppress the autocrine growth of AML cells by inhibiting their production of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF. In addition, the administration of IL-10 may be harmless to normal hematopoiesis because IL-10 did not suppress the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our study provides experimental support for the clinical application of IL-10 in patients with AML.

TI  - Chronic recurrent osteomyelitis with clavicular involvement in children: diagnostic value of different imaging techniques and therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  
AB  - Chronic recurrent, uni- or multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), an inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, involves mk:/night/arul/4310946m.3dultiple osseous sites and may affect the clavicle. We report on 6 children with clavicular involvement out of 11 children suffering from CRMO. The major clinical symptoms were local swelling and pain. Five children had hyperostosis of the clavicle and synovitis of adjacent joints. Histology showed chronic osteomyelitis with a predominance of lymphocytes in the inflammatory infiltrates. Cultures of biopsy tissue specimens were sterile. The patients were followed for at least 3.5 years. Three patients had up to six relapses. The most effective diagnostic tools to define CRMO were standard X-ray and bone scan in combination with biopsy and cultures. In our patients CT and MRI were misleading as they suggested the presence of malignancy. However, the sensitivity of MRI to detect involvement of bone, adjacent joints and soft tissues were better in comparison to X-ray or bone scan. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were effective in reducing pain, swelling and limitation of motion. Reconstructive surgery was not indicated in any case. The long-term outcome of growth and function of affected bones was excellent. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis of the clavicle should be made by history and physical examination and be confirmed by standard X-ray, bone scan and open biopsy. In contrast MRI and CT can provide data on the involvement of adjacent joints, soft tissue and muscles especially in the early process of disease, but do not add information relevant to the patient's management. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is rapidly beneficial in most patients.

TI  - Effect of chronic oral administration of the CCK receptor antagonist loxiglumide on exocrine and endocrine pancreas in normal rats.  
AB  - CONCLUSION: In normal adult rats, administration of a low dose of loxiglumide for 7 d had no significant effect on exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function, whereas a high dose of loxiglumide decreased pancreatic enzyme output without inducing insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND: There is a possibility that chronic administration of cholecystokinin receptor antagonists not only inhibits the growth of the pancreas but also alters exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. METHODS: Loxiglumide at a dose of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight, or the same volume of saline, was given by an orogastric tube twice daily for 7 d (13 successive times). Biochemical and functional changes were determined on d 8 at 24 h after the last administration of loxiglumide and 18 h fasting. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function was simultaneously determined following an intravenous injection of a mixed solution of 0.5 g/kg body weight glucose plus 100 ng/kg body weight cerulein. RESULTS: Pancreatic weight and protein content were dose-dependently decreased by loxiglumide, whereas DNA content was decreased only by the highest dose of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide caused dose-dependent decreases in pancreatic fluid and protein output. Total pancreatic insulin content in rats treated with loxiglumide was not significantly different from that in the control rats. However, insulin concentration relative to DNA content was significantly increased in rats treated with 200 mg/kg body weight loxiglumide compared with that in other groups of rats. Glucose-stimulated insulin release was significantly low in rats treated with the highest dose of loxiglumide compared with that in other groups of rats, although there was no difference of serum glucose concentrations among these four groups of rats.

TI  - Effect of interleukin-1 and dexamethasone on interleukin-6 production and growth in human meningiomas.  
AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to be released by cultured human meningioma cells and may be a positive or negative regulator of tumour growth. IL-6 protein and mRNA levels have been examined in a series of meningiomas. In 14 cases, the results are compared with the effects of IL-6 and dexamethasone on growth and IL-6 secretion in vitro. Tumours with the highest in vivo IL-6 mRNA expression also showed maximum induction of IL-6 and increased cellular proliferation on IL-1 stimulation in vitro. Dexamethasone decreased the IL-1-stimulated IL-6 release in all cases. Meningiomas which had little or no IL-6 message were refractory to IL-1 control of IL-6. Remarkably, these formed the group of meningiomas that increased their growth rate in response to dexamethasone.

TI  - Expression of sex hormone-binding globulin exon VII splicing variant messenger ribonucleic acid in human ovarian endometriosis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) exon VII splicing variant messenger RNA (mRNA) in human ovarian endometriosis. DESIGN: The expression of SHBG variant mRNA in normal uterine endometrium and endometriotic tissue was determined. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gifu University Hospital. PATIENT(S): Fourteen women with endometriosis and 18 women without endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): Normal uterine endometrial and ovarian endometriotic tissues from patients who had undergone gynecological surgery were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Levels of SHBG wild-type and variant mRNAs were determined using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS(S): Analysis of the missing base pairs proved that they corresponded to the entire exon VII. There was no significant difference between the levels of SHBG wild-type mRNA in normal endometria and in endometriotic endometria, although the levels of SHBG variant mRNA in endometriotic endometria were significantly higher than that in normal endometria. The ratio of SHBG variant to wild-type mRNA levels was significantly higher in endometriotic endometria than in normal endometria. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the coexpression of SHBG exon VII splicing variant mRNA with its wild-type and the dominant expression of the variant in ovarian endometriosis. These results might be involved in the cellular estrogenic interaction, plausibly assisting in the development and growth of ovarian endometriosis.

TI  -  Comparative intraosseal growth of human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 in the nude mouse.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 75% of patients with advanced prostate carcinoma have skeletal involvement, which is the principal metastatic site and the major complication of this disease. The goal of this work was to compare the osseous metastasis of androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate cancers in the nude mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Androgen-sensitive LNCaP or -insensitive PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells were injected directly into the femur medullas of male nude Beige mice, the animals were then sacrificed at successive time intervals to study the gross and microscopic characteristics of the established tumors. RESULTS: LNCaP and PC-3 both colonized in the bone marrow within a week, then gradually expanded to the entire bone medulla followed by osseous infiltration to produce obvious symptoms in the affected extremities. Based on the morphology, both osteoblastic and osteolytic changes occurred during the course of tumor progression. In addition, PC-3 tumors eventually broke through the bone cortex, invaded the surrounding tissues, and metastasized to the regional lymph nodes. In contrast, LNCaP remained localized within the bone, and appeared to eventually regress and die after displacing the normal bone marrow cells. Immunohistochemically, LNCaP tumors were consistently positive for prostate-specific antigen in bone metastasis, while PC-3 tumors were negative. Tumor cell nuclei of both PC-3 and LNCaP hybridized to a human repeated sequence DNA probe indicating that the proliferating malignant cells were of human origin. CONCLUSIONS: These cancer cell lines produced a high incidence of growth in the bone that differed in histogenesis. The relative malignancy of these cell lines was demonstrated in this model.

TI  - Orthodontic treatment of a patient with hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets.  
AB  - Hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets, when developed later in life, is less severe and may not be characterized by rickets or other osseous deformities. A Japanese girl, age nine years and one month, was first seen in the Dental Hospital of Osaka University, complaining of the crowding of the maxillary teeth. At one year of age, the patient was admitted to Osaka University Hospital for her leg deformities. Although the patient has been administered 4 micrograms 1 alpha/-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1.0 g phosphorous daily, the serum phosphate has been low and never reached normal level. This case was a Class II division 2 malocclusion with severe anterior crowding and retarded mandibular growth. We treated her with a functional appliance (elastic open activator), followed by the extraction of four premolars and the use of an edgewise appliance. No unfavorable root resorption or bone defect occurred. Good occlusion was achieved and the facial features were pleasing.

TI  - Oncogenic potential of a mutant human thyrotropin receptor expressed in FRTL-5 cells.  
AB  - An abnormal stimulation of the cAMP pathway has been recognized as the primary event in various pathological situations that lead to goitrogenesis or thyroid tumors. Thyroid adenomas are monoclonal neoplasms that become independent of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in their secretory function and growth. Mutated forms of the TSH receptor (TSHR) and the adenylyl cyclase-activating Gs alpha protein, which confer a constitutive activity on these proteins, have been observed in human adenomas. The FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line is a permanent but untransformed line; the growth of which depends on the presence of TSH, and at least in part, on the stimulation of the cAMP pathway. In order to compare the oncogenic potential of the activated mutant Gs alpha protein and the constitutively activated TSHR, we have transfected FRTL-5 cells with an expression vector bearing either the cDNA of the Gs alpha gene carrying the A201S mutation or the cDNA of the TSH receptor carrying the M453T mutation recently identified in a case of congenital hyperthyroidism. The expression of these two cDNAs was driven by the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter. We show that, although the expression of both the Gs alpha or TSHR mutant proteins leads to TSH-independent proliferation and to constitutive cAMP accumulation in FRTL-5 cells, only the mutant TSHR is able to induce neoplastic transformation, as demonstrated by growth in semi-solid medium and tumorigenesis in nude mice.

TI  - Heparan/chondroitin/dermatan sulfate primer 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside preferentially inhibits growth of transformed cells.  
AB  - Xylose forms the direct carbohydrate-protein link in extra- or pericellular proteoglycans (PGs) that are substituted with either chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) and/or heparan sulfate (HS). Cell surface PGs carrying HS are important regulators of cell growth. Xylose coupled to an aromatic compound can enter cells and initiate either CS/DS synthesis or both HS and CS/DS synthesis, depending on the nature of the aromatic adduct. Here, we show that 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside, which can prime both types of glycan chains, inhibits growth of a set of normal and transformed cells. Transformed cells are preferentially inhibited, and at a concentration of 0.15-0.20 mM xyloside, transformed cells are totally growth arrested, whereas normal cells are only < or = 50% inhibited. No inhibition of growth is observed with the stereoisomeric 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)-O-beta-L-xylopyranoside, which does not prime glycosaminoglycan synthesis at all; with the nonhydroxylated 2-naphthyl-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside, which only primes CS/DS synthesis under these conditions; or with p-nitrophenyl-O-beta-D-xylopyranoside, which is known to prime only CS/DS synthesis. We conclude that growth inhibition is due to priming of HS and/or CS/DS synthesis, which may either lead to the formation of specific antiproliferative glycans or glycan fragments or to interference with endogenous PG synthesis and turnover.

TI  - The conserved carboxyl terminus and zinc finger-like domain of the co-chaperone Ydj1 assist Hsp70 in protein folding.  
AB  - Ydj1 is a member of the Hsp40 (DnaJ-related) chaperone family that facilitates cellular protein folding by regulating Hsp70 ATPase activity and binding unfolded polypeptides. Ydj1 contains four conserved subdomains that appear to represent functional units. To define the action of these regions, protease-resistant Ydj1 fragments and Ydj1 mutants were analyzed for activities exhibited by the unmodified protein. The Ydj1 mutant proteins analyzed were unable to support growth of yeast at elevated temperatures and were found to have alterations in the J-domain (Ydj1 H34Q), zinc finger-like region (Ydj1 C159T), and conserved carboxyl terminus (Ydj1 G315D). Fragment Ydj1 (1-90) contains the J-domain and a small portion of the G/F-rich region and could regulate Hsp70 ATPase activity but could not suppress the aggregation of the model protein rhodanese. Ydj1 H34Q could not regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 but could bind unfolded polypeptides. The J-domain functions independently and was sufficient to regulate Hsp70 ATPase activity. Fragment Ydj1 (179-384) could suppress rhodanese aggregation but was unable to regulate Hsp70. Ydj1 (179-384) contains the conserved carboxyl terminus of DnaJ but is missing the J-domain, G/F-rich region, and a major portion of the zinc finger-like region. Ydj1 G315D exhibited severe defects in its ability to suppress rhodanese aggregation and form complexes with unfolded luciferase. The conserved carboxyl terminus of Ydj1 appeared to participate in the binding of unfolded polypeptides. Ydj1 C159T could form stable complexes with unfolded proteins and suppress protein aggregation but was inefficient at refolding denatured luciferase. The zinc finger-like region of Ydj1 appeared to function in conjunction with the conserved carboxyl terminus to fold proteins. However, Ydj1 does not require an intact zinc finger-like region to bind unfolded polypeptides. These data suggest that the combined functions of the J-domain, zinc finger-like region, and the conserved carboxyl terminus are required for Ydj1 to cooperate with Hsp70 and facilitate protein folding in the cell.

TI  - Enhancement of blue-light sensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings by a blue light receptor cryptochrome 2.  
AB  - Cryptochrome is a group of flavin-type blue light receptors that regulate plant growth and development. The function of Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2 in the early photomorphogenesis of seedlings was studied by using transgenic plants overexpressing CRY2 protein, and cry2 mutant plants accumulating no CRY2 protein. It is found that cryptochrome 2 mediates blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and stimulation of cotyledon opening under low intensities of blue light. In contrast to CRY1, the expression of CRY2 is rapidly down-regulated by blue light in a light-intensity dependent manner, which provides a molecular mechanism to explain at least in part that cryptochrome 2 functions primarily under low light during the early development of seedlings.

TI  - Corticotropin regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human fetal adrenal cortical cells.  
AB  - The human adrenal cortex has a complex vasculature that is essential for growth, organ maintenance, and access of secreted hormones to the circulation. Growth and function of the adrenal cortex are regulated by corticotropin (ACTH), the actions of which are in part mediated by locally produced growth factors. As cortical growth and vascularization must increase in a coordinated manner, we hypothesized that ACTH also influences adrenal cortical angiogenesis by stimulating the local expression of specific angiogenic factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent endothelial cell-specific angiogenic peptide, the expression of which has been detected in adrenal cortical cells. Therefore, we examined the localization of VEGF expression in the midgestation (16-20 weeks) human fetal adrenal cortex and determined whether VEGF expression and secretion by isolated human fetal adrenal cortical cells are regulated by ACTH. By immunohistochemical analysis, strong cytoplasmic staining for VEGF was detected in scattered clusters of fetal zone (inner cortical compartment) cells. In contrast, cells in the outer, definitive zone of the cortex stained only weakly for VEGF. The predominant staining for VEGF in the fetal zone correlated with the extensive vasculature of this zone as detected by immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor, which is specific for endothelial cells. In primary cultures of human fetal adrenal cortical cells, ACTH (1 nmol/L) and forskolin (10 micromol/L) increased the abundance of messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts encoding VEGF, as assessed by Northern and slot blot analyses. The stimulatory effect of ACTH and forskolin on VEGF gene expression occurred within 2 h of agonist exposure and persisted for at least 24 h. ACTH and forskolin also increased VEGF protein secretion by fetal adrenal cortical cells, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for VEGF in fetal adrenal cortical cell-conditioned medium. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in VEGF secretion was detected as early as 8 h after ACTH or forskolin treatment. By 24 h after the addition of ACTH or forskolin, VEGF secreted from isolated human fetal adrenal cells was increased 5- to 6-fold. These data demonstrate that the human fetal adrenal cortex, particularly the cells of the inner fetal zone, express VEGF and that VEGF expression and secretion by these cells are directly regulated by ACTH and the activation of adenylate cyclase. Thus, VEGF may be a local regulator of adrenal cortical angiogenesis and an important mediator of the tropic action of ACTH, ensuring the coordination of ACTH-stimulated cortical growth and vascularization.

TI  - Protein lipid interaction in bile: effects of biliary proteins on the stability of cholesterol-lecithin vesicles.  
AB  - The nucleation of cholesterol crystals is an obligatory precursor to cholesterol gallstone formation. Nucleation, in turn, is believed to be preceded by aggregation and fusion of cholesterol-rich vesicles. We have investigated the effects of two putative pro-nucleating proteins, a concanavalin A-binding protein fraction and a calcium-binding protein, on the stability of sonicated small unilamellar cholesterol-lecithin vesicles. Vesicle aggregation is followed by monitoring absorbance, and upon addition of the concanavalin A-binding protein fraction the absorbance of a vesicle dispersion increases continuously with time. Vesicle fusion is probed by a fluorescence contents-mixing assay. Vesicles apparently fuse slowly after the addition of the concanavalin A-binding protein, although inner filter effects confound the quantitative measurement of fusion rates. The rates of change of absorbance and fluorescence increase with the concentration of the protein, and the second-order dimerization rate constant increases with both the protein concentration and the cholesterol content of the vesicles. On the other hand, the calcium-binding protein has no effect on the stability of the vesicle dispersion. This protein may therefore affect cholesterol crystal formation not by promoting the nucleation process, but by enhancing crystal growth and packaging. Our results demonstrate that biliary proteins can destabilize lipid vesicles and that different proteins play different roles in the mechanism of cholesterol gallstone formation.

TI  - Thanatophoric dysplasia type II: new entity?  
AB  - There is some question about whether the two forms of thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), Type II with and Type I without cloverleaf skull, belong to the same entity. Thus, we investigated one 6-day-old TD with cloverleaf skull using examination of the external phenotype, radiology, autopsy, skeleton preparation, large section histology, detailed section histology, and ultrastructure. The loss of the three-phase contours-characteristics for Type I (54)--in certain metaphyses, the absence of the perichondral spurs to some extent, and their substitution by a structure similar to the perichondral "ring of Lacroix" have a suggested origin in normal cartilage-bone tissue. The same mechanism is postulated (a) for the appearance of less bent or normally shaped tubular bones compared with TD Type I, and their corresponding increased mechanical stability, and (b) for the less amount of platyspondyly in Type II than in Type I. We suggest that the malformation of the cloverleaf skull has its origin in the promontory growth of the relatively normal cartilage-bone tissues at the skull base resulting in an early synostosis and a consecutive fusion of the cranial sutures. The ultrastructural analysis of chondrocytes demonstrates the significant contribution of electron microscopy for TD studies. We suggest that pathologically altered light chondrocytes accounts for plump cross-striated collagen fibrils, the reduced cellular proliferation, and the impaired formation of columnar and hypertrophic zones. It is clear that normal cartilage-bone tissue distributed among "thanatophoric" tissue is the reason for the differences between Type I and Type II. Hypotheses are presented that explain this tissue mosaicism. Thus, TD Type I and TD Type II do not represent two different entities but the same entity with varying features due to mutational events occurring at different times.

TI  - Control of Leishmania major by a monoclonal alpha beta T cell repertoire.  
AB  - Little is known regarding the diversity of the host T cell response that is required to maintain immunologic control of microbial pathogens. Leishmania major persist as obligate intracellular parasites within macrophages of the mammalian host. Immunity is dependent upon activation of MHC class II-restricted T cells to an effector state capable of restricting growth and dissemination of the organisms. We generated alpha-beta Leishmania-specific (ABLE) TCR transgenic mice with MHC class II-restricted T cells that recognized an immunodominant Leishmania Ag designated LACK. Naive T cells from ABLE mice proliferated in vitro after incubation with recombinant LACK or with Leishmania-parasitized macrophages and in vivo after injection into infected mice. Infected ABLE mice controlled Leishmania infection almost as well as wild-type mice despite a drastic reduction in the T cell repertoire. ABLE mice were crossed to mice with disruption of the TCR constant region alpha gene to create animals with a single alpha beta T cell repertoire. Although mice deficient in all alpha beta T cells (TCR-C alpha 0 mice) failed to control L. major, mice with a monoclonal alpha beta T cell repertoire (ABLE TCR-C alpha 0 mice) displayed substantial control. The immune system is capable of remarkable efficiency even when constrained to recognition of a single epitope from a complex organism.

TI  - The role of exogenous growth-promoting factors and their receptors in embryogenesis.  
AB  - During organogenesis, the cells of the embryo may require growth factors that promote a cascade of intracellular events. An absolute requirement for exogenous insulin by presomite 9.5-d rat embryos grown in culture has been demonstrated. The uptake and processing of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I showed different uptake and localization patterns. When epidermal growth factor (EGF) or "long EGF" is added to media depleted of low molecular weight material, a dose-dependent improvement in growth is observed. Furthermore, the specific EGF receptor signal transduction inhibitor Tyrphostin 47 can inhibit embryonic growth when it is administered in culture. When Tyrphostin 47 was microinjected into embryos on Day 11 and their growth and differentiation evaluated on Day 12 of gestation, a dose-dependent decrease in developmental score was observed. Thus, exogenous growth factors may be essential to normal rat development and these may be synthesized locally in the decidua or placental tissues. Perturbations to ligand-receptor interactions may be a mechanism for dysmorphogenesis.

TI  - Tumour tissue is a source of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase sialoform in the sera of melanoma-bearing mice.  
AB  - The total serum activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was shown to increase with the growth of transplantable B16 and S91 melanomas in inbred mice. In an effort to define the source of the GGT shed into the bloodstream the physicochemical characteristics of the partially purified GGT isoforms from liver, serum and B16 melanoma were compared. The molecular weights of the serum and melanoma isoforms were identical (86 kDa) and differed from that of the liver isoform (69 kDa). In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the serum and melanoma isoforms had a similar mobility which exceeded that of the liver enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme preparations with neuraminidase removed the differences in the electrophoretic mobility of the three GGT isoforms studied. On ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Spheron 300 LC column the melanoma and serum isoforms had an affinity to the sorbent unlike the liver isoform. Our observations suggest that melanoma cells express a sialoform of GGT which is responsible for an increase in the total GGT serum activity. Biochemical and histochemical analyses did not reveal any increase in liver GGT production associated with melanoma development. Detection of the GGT isoform of tumour origin in sera ranks GGT among the specific melanoma markers.

TI  - Improvement of the production of foreign proteins using a heterologous secretion vector system in Bacillus subtilis: effects of resistance to glucose-mediated catabolite repression.  
AB  - To improve protein production, a heterologous secretion vector system was constructed with the aid of the amyR2 region. The operator sequence (amyO) of the amyR2 region on the secretion vector was changed through site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate carbon-source-mediated catabolite repression. Three substitutional (AG, G5, G10), one deletional (delta HH), and one insertional (AGHF) mutant promoters were obtained. The expression level and the degree of catabolite repression of amyR2 and the mutant promoters were examined with a single copy system using an integrational promoter probe vector, pDH32. Under glucose-free culture conditions, expression levels from all mutant promoters except HH were 1.4 to 1.5 fold higher than that from amyR2. While the expression of the amyR2 promoter was repressed by 90% in the presence of 2% glucose, expression levels of the mutant promoters were repressed by only 1% to 50%. To evaluate the advantage of the mutant promoters in production of foreign proteins by the heterologous secretion system, beta-lactamase and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (hPSTI) were expressed by the mutant promoters. When B. subtilis LKS87 was used as a host strain, the production of the target proteins using the respective mutant promoter was increased by about 1.5 fold under glucose-free culture conditions. Under the high glucose culture conditions, secretion of target proteins produced from the mutant promoters increased 1.5 to 2 fold, whereas those by the amyR2 promoter were reduced to between 50% and 60%. The additive effect of degUh mutation on protein production was not observed under high glucose culture conditions. In addition, such culture conditions inhibited proteolytic degradation of secreted target proteins after the stationary growth phase even in B. subtilis LKS88 (degUh mutant). Thus, our results indicated that the mutant promoters, which are resistant to glucose-mediated catabolite repression, are very useful for over-production of foreign proteins under the high glucose culture conditions using the heterologous expression-secretion system in B. subtilis.

TI  - hyp loci control cell pattern formation in the vegetative mycelium of Aspergillus nidulans.  
AB  - Aspergillus nidulans grows by apical extension of multinucleate cells called hyphae that are subdivided by the insertion of crosswalls called septa. Apical cells vary in length and number of nuclei, whereas subapical cells are typically 40 microm long with three to four nuclei. Apical cells have active mitotic cycles, whereas subapical cells are arrested for growth and mitosis until branch formation reinitiates tip growth and nuclear divisions. This multicellular growth pattern requires coordination between localized growth, nuclear division, and septation. We searched a temperature-sensitive mutant collection for strains with conditional defects in growth patterning and identified six mutants (designated hyp for hypercellular). The identified hyp mutations are nonlethal, recessive defects in five unlinked genes (hypA-hypE). Phenotypic analyses showed that these hyp mutants have aberrant patterns of septation and show defects in polarity establishment and tip growth, but they have normal nuclear division cycles and can complete the asexual growth cycle at restrictive temperature. Temperature shift analysis revealed that hypD and hypE play general roles in hyphal morphogenesis, since inactivation of these genes resulted in a general widening of apical and subapical cells. Interestingly, loss of hypA or hypB function lead to a cessation of apical cell growth but activated isotropic growth and mitosis in subapical cells. The inferred functions of hypA and hypB suggest a mechanism for coordinating apical growth, subapical cell arrest, and mitosis in A. nidulans.

TI  - Microbial photodegradation of aminoarenes. Metabolism of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol by Rhodobacter capsulatus.  
AB  - The phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus photoreduces 2,4-dinitrophenol to 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, which is further metabolized by an aerobic pathway that is also light-dependent. The catabolism of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol requires O2 and the presence of alternative carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources, preferably acetate and ammonium. Rhodobacter capsulatus B10, a bacterium unable to assimilate nitrate, releases negligible amounts of nitrite when growing with 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, thus suggesting that an oxygenase, nitrite-producing activity is not involved in the metabolization of the compound.  The diazotrophic growth of R. capsulatus increases in the presence of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, but growth with ammonium is clearly inhibited by the compound. Mutant strains of R. capsulatus B10, which are affected in nifHDK, nifR1, or nifR4 genes, unable to fix dinitrogen, do not grow with 2-amino-4-nitrophenol as the sole N source. This indicates that the compound cannot be used as a N source. The nif mutants degrade 2-amino-4-nitrophenol to the same extent as the wild-type in the presence of ammonium. The compound is not used as a C source by the bacterium, either. Aromatic stable intermediates, such as 2,4-diaminophenol or 4-nitrocatechol, are not detectable in microaerobic cultures of R. capsulatus growing with 2,4-dinitrophenol or 2-amino-4-nitrophenol.

TI  - Fetal growth retardation and second trimester maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels.  
AB  - Second trimester maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels in women who remained normotensive but delivered an unexplained growth retarded infant were compared with those from a control group and a group of women who developed pre-eclampsia in a retrospective observational study. Our hypothesis was that the similar placental pathological changes shared by unexplained normotensive IUGR and pre-eclampsia would be reflected by elevated maternal serum hCG levels in the second trimester. Normotensive women delivering unexplained singleton growth retarded infants were identified (n=43) and their second trimester hCG levels, taken as part of antenatal screening for Down's syndrome, were obtained. These were compared with a control group of 625 women, and a group of 48 women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. There was no significant difference in the hCG levels expressed as multiples of the median (MOM) between the women who delivered growth retarded fetuses (median MOM 0.96) and the control group (median MOM 0.97). The levels of hCG in the women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia were significantly higher (median MOM 1.3, P=0.008). There were no significant differences in AFP levels in the three groups; however, the trend was towards a higher level of AFP in the fetal growth retardation group. Maternal serum hCG in the second trimester does not appear to be elevated in normotensive women who later produce a growth retarded fetus, although human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are significantly higher in women who subsequently develop pre-eclampsia.

AZT inhibited the growth of all tumoral cell lines, but it did so in a wide range of concentrations.  The growth of a normal breast cell line was also inhibited, although it required a much higher concentration. Furthermore, AZT inhibited colony formation in soft agar and telomerase activity. These results indicated that AZT can be potentially used, alone or in combination, as an anti-breast cancer agent.

TI  - Estrogen receptor-negative epithelial cells in mouse mammary gland development and growth.  
AB  - The mouse mammary gland undergoes rapid proliferation during puberty, then cyclical proliferation and involution during adulthood within a 5-day estrous cycle. Although proliferation of mammary epithelial cells is directed by elevated serum levels of estrogen acting via the estrogen receptor (ER), the ER status of the proliferating cells remains unknown. We examined the ER expression of proliferating epithelial cell types during pubertal development and normal adult growth using simultaneous immunohistochemistry for ER and tritiated thymidine (3H-Tdr) autoradiography. These studies demonstrate that during pubertal growth (4-6 weeks) ER-negative cells comprise more than 50% of the epithelial cell populations in the terminal end buds (TEBs) and ducts. Furthermore, the majority of proliferating cells in both TEBs and ducts are ER-negative. These findings indicate that proliferation of cells within both the TEBs and the mammary ducts contribute to pubertal growth of the mammary gland and that the greater proportion of dividing cells are ER-negative. Similar patterns of cell growth were observed in the normal estrous cycle when the majority of dividing cells were ER-negative during both pro-estrous and estrous. Intensive labelling of cells with 3H-Tdr was used to identify long-lived mammary epithelial cells which retained 3H-Tdr 2 weeks following labelling (i.e., following 3 estrous cycles). Of the small number of mammary epithelial cells retaining 3H-Tdr label, most were ER-positive luminal cells and only a few were ER-negative basal cells. This study indicates that pubertal growth of the mammary gland comprises division of ER-negative cap cells and of both ER-negative and ER-positive cells in the body of the TEBs and elongating mammary ducts. Similarly, estrogen-driven proliferation of ER-negative and ER-positive luminal cells and ER-negative basal cells maintains the differentiated mammary gland in the adult mouse.

TI  - Population dynamics of the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus, and Euroglyphus maynei (Acari: Pyroglyphidae) at specific relative humidities.  
AB  - Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of relative humidity on the population dynamics of single and mixed species of Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes, D. pteronyssinus (Trouessart), and Euroglyphus maynei (Cooreman) at specific relative humidities maintained at 20 degrees C, with unlimited food. The population density of single and mixed species (D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus) increased exponentially when cultured at 65, 70, and 75% RH. The mean population growth rates were 17.3 +/- 4.4 SD and 32.5% +/- 4.7/wk for D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, respectively. Mean population doubling times were 2.2 +/- 0.3 and 4.2 +/- 1.3 wk for D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae, respectively. Mixed species cultures, started with equal numbers of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, resulted in higher percentages of D. farinae than D. pteronyssinus. In cultures started with 75% of one species and 25% of the other, the more numerous species remained dominant and in similar ratios throughout the experiment. Both D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus population densities maintained at 85% RH declined over a 12-wk culture period because of mold growth. E. maynei were unable to survive at 65, 70, 75, and 85% RH, which indicated that their climatic requirements were different from those of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus. Population densities of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus cultures declined when held at 21-22 degrees C and relative humidities of < or = 50%; however, at 50% RH, significant proportions of the populations survived for 10 wk. Half-life for desiccation of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus at 45% RH was 11.5 and 1.2 wk, respectively, but at 50% RH was 86.3 and 4.0 wk, respectively. The data indicated that a < or = 50% RH would have to be maintained for long periods to reduce both D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus by desiccation procedures. The results of this study show that D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus have high reproductive potentials and population growth rates, which indicate that mite reduction procedures must be thorough or mite densities will return to high levels quickly following remediation if adequate food and suitable microclimatic conditions exist.

TI  - Colorectal carcinoma invasion inhibition by CO17-1A/GA733 antigen and its murine homologue [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal carcinoma antigen GA733 is a potential target for passive and active immunotherapy for patients with colorectal carcinoma. This antigen has been characterized previously as a homophilic adhesion (i.e., adhesion to self) protein, but the functional consequences of homophilic adhesion for tumor growth and invasion are unknown. The availability of a murine homologue of GA733, i.e., murine epithelial glycoprotein (mEGP), allows for functional analysis of cell adhesion as it relates to tumor growth and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: CT-26 murine colorectal carcinoma cells were transfected with complementary DNAs encoding either the human or the murine antigen. GA733- or mEGP-producing cells were evaluated for homophilic adhesion, growth on plastic surfaces, colony formation in soft agar, and invasion through a reconstructed basement membrane (Matrigel). mEGP-producing cells were also examined for their capacity to metastasize in mice. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with control cells, mEGP-producing cells showed significantly lower growth rates, colony formation, and invasion through Matrigel in vitro (all P values <.05). Compared with vector-only transfected cells and parental cells, mEGP-producing cells showed a reduction in metastatic potential in syngeneic immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice (all P values <.05). In contrast to mEGP-transfected cells, GA733-transfected cells did not exhibit significantly reduced growth or colony formation in vitro (all P values >.05). However, GA733-transfected cells did show reduced invasion through Matrigel compared with vector-only transfected cells or parental cells (all P values <.05). CONCLUSION: The adhesion proteins GA733 and mEGP inhibit invasion of tumor cells.

TI  - Fetal and neonatal mortality in the postterm pregnancy: the impact of gestational age and fetal growth restriction.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine the impact of gestational age and fetal growth restriction on fetal and neonatal mortality rates in the postterm pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: All deliveries occurring in Sweden between Jan. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 1992, were evaluated for participation in this study. Data were derived from the National Swedish Medical Birth Registry. Pregnancies were selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of the following criteria: (1) singleton pregnancy, (2) reliable dates, (3) gestational age > or = 40 weeks, and (4) maternal age 15 to 44 years. Fetal growth restriction was defined as birth weight <2 SD below the mean for gestational age. A total of 181,524 pregnancies met the inclusion criteria and formed the study population. Fetal and neonatal mortalities at 40 weeks' gestation were used as reference levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the independent effects of gestational age and fetal growth restriction on fetal and neonatal mortality rates. RESULTS: A significant rise in the odds ratio for fetal death was detected from 41 weeks' gestation and on (odds ratios 1.5, 1.8, and 2.9 at 41, 42, and 43 weeks, respectively). Odds ratios for neonatal mortality did not demonstrate a significant gestational age dependency. Fetal growth restriction was associated with significantly higher odds ratios for both fetal and neonatal mortality rates at every gestational age examined (with odds ratios ranging from 7.1 to 10.0 for fetal death and from 3.4 to 9.4 for neonatal death). CONCLUSIONS: Postterm pregnancies have long been considered to be at high risk for adverse perinatal outcome. This study documents a small but significant increase in fetal mortality in accurately dated pregnancies that extend beyond 41 weeks of gestation. This study also demonstrates that fetal growth restriction is independently associated with increased perinatal mortality in these pregnancies.

TI  - Predicted and observed growth of Listeria monocytogenes in seafood challenge tests and in naturally contaminated cold-smoked salmon.  
AB  - The performance of the Pathogen Modelling Program, the Food MicroModel, the Murphy-model and the Ross-model for growth of L. monocytogenes was evaluated by comparison with data from 100 seafood challenge tests and data from 13 storage trials with naturally contaminated sliced vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon. Challenge tests with both cured and noncured products were studied, and graphs as well as the bias- and the accuracy factors were used for comparison of the observed and predicted growth. The Pathogen Modelling Program could not be successfully validated in seafood challenge tests. Growth rates were markedly overestimated and the mu(max)-bias factor was as high as 3.9 in challenge tests with cured products. On the basis of the effect of temperature, NaCl/a(w) and pH, the mu(max)-bias factor of the other three models studied, varied between 1.0 and 2.3 in the challenge tests with cured and noncured seafoods. None of the models accurately predicted the growth in both cured and noncured seafoods. However, the results indicated that a new expanded model, including the additional effect of lactate and phenol, may provide accurate predictions of the growth of L. monocytogenes in challenge tests with various types of seafoods. Storage trials clearly showed the growth of L. monocytogenes in naturally contaminated cold-smoked salmon to be markedly slower than growth in inoculated challenge tests. Consequently, all four models substantially overestimated growth in the naturally contaminated products. Temperature, pH, NaCl/a(w) and lactate were measured in the storage trials and on the basis of these parameters, the Food MicroModel mu(max)-bias factor was 5.2. Clearly, the model could not be successfully validated with naturally contaminated cold-smoked salmon. To improve the applicability of predictive models to fish products, it is suggested to include studies with naturally contaminated products in the development and validation of models with seafood pathogens.

TI  - Maturation-dependent gene expression in a conditionally transformed liver progenitor cell line.  
AB  - We have isolated a conditionally transformed liver progenitor cell line with phenotypic similarities to both hepatoblasts (bipotent embryonic liver cells that give rise to hepatocytes and intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells) and liver epithelial cells (primitive hepatic cells isolated from adult livers capable of generating both hepatocytic and biliary lineages). Cell line L2039 was derived from E14 fetal mouse liver after transformation with temperature-sensitive SV-40 large T antigen. At 33 degrees C, these cells have an epithelial morphology with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio and express both hepatocytic and biliary genes, including albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, glutamine synthetase, insulinlike growth factor II receptor, fibronectin and laminin, and cytokeratins 8 and 19, a set of markers characteristic for hepatoblasts. The presence of cytokeratin 14, vimentin, and several oval-cell antigens link cell line L2039 to nonparenchymal liver epithelial cell populations thought to contain progenitor cells. Serum-free, hormonally defined media conditions and extracellular matrix requirements were determined for growth and differentiation of this cell line. During culture on type IV collagen at 39 degrees C, L2039 cells cease dividing and demonstrate hepatocytic differentiation with the assumption of a hepatocytelike morphology and glucocorticoid-dependent regulation of liver-specific genes, including albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and liver-enriched transcription factors. The number of albumin-positive cells increases during culture at 39 degrees C, indicating that L2039 cells convert from a prehepatocytic to a hepatocytic phenotype. Under conditions specific for hepatocytic differentiation, C/EBPs were expressed and differentially regulated, with C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta upregulated early and C/EBPalpha only slightly expressed after 7 d, indicating that C/EBPalpha may not be a crucial factor in commitment to the hepatocytic phenotype.

TI  - Impaired tumorigenicity of IL-4-producing murine neuroblastoma cells in immunodeficient nude mice.  
AB  - We have examined antitumor effect of murine neuroblastoma cells (C1300) retrovirally transduced with interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene in syngeneic A/J and nude mice. Although in vitro proliferation of IL-4-secreting C1300 cells (C1300/IL-4) was not different from that of wild-type cells, the in vivo tumor growth of C1300/IL-4 cells subcutaneously inoculated into immunocompetent A/J mice was retarded compared with that of wild-type cells and consequently, the survival of the A/J mice which received C1300/IL-4 cells was prolonged. In immunodeficient nude mice we observed accelerated growth rate of wild-type tumors in comparison with the tumors developed in A/J mice. In contrast, the tumor growth of C1300/IL-4 cells in nude mice was significantly suppressed and the growth was much slower than that of C1300/IL-4 cells inoculated in A/J mice. Thus, the secretion of IL-4 from tumor cells produced antitumor effect more efficiently in mature T cell-defective hosts than in immunocompetent mice. Our results suggest a possible clinical application of IL-4 expression in tumor cells via genetic manipulations especially in immunocompromised cancer patients.

TI  - Cooperativity between the polyamine pathway and HER-2neu in transformation of human mammary epithelial cells in culture: role of the MAPK pathway.  
AB  - Our experiments were designed to test the cooperativity between the polyamine pathway and HER-2neu in inducing transformation of human mammary epithelial cells in culture. Using the MCF-10A breast epithelial cell line, we observed that induction of overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (the first rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis) markedly potentiated the anchorage-independent growth stimulating effect of the beta2 isoform of neu differentiating factor (NDF) known to activate HER-2neu in MCF-10A cells. ODC overexpression, on the other hand, did not enhance growth in liquid culture, thus pointing to a specific effect on transformation rather than proliferation. ODC-overexpressing MCF-10A cells exhibited increased MAPK phosphorylation in response to administration of NDF and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF). In contrast, the phosphorylation of the members of the stress-activated protein kinase cascade p38 and SEK were not affected by ODC overexpression. Of note, in the absence of EGF and NDF, ODC overexpression failed to induce both clonogenicity and MAPK activation. These results suggest that increased polyamine biosynthetic activity critically interacts with HER-2neu in promoting human mammary cell transformation in culture and that the MAPK cascade is an important mediator of this interaction. If confirmed in future in vivo studies, our results may identify important new targets for the chemoprevention of human breast cancer.

TI  - Effect of cadmium(II) on the extent of oxidative DNA damage in primary brain cell cultures from Pleurodeles larvae.  
AB  - Compounds of cadmium(II) are well-known human and animal carcinogens. Furthermore, they affect development. growth and brain functions at subacute environmental concentrations in experimental animals. We investigated the potential of cadmium(II) to induce oxidative DNA damage in brain cell cultures obtained from larvae of Pleurodeles waltl. As indicators of DNA lesions typical of oxygen free radicals, we determined the frequencies of DNA strand breaks and of DNA base modifications recognized by the bacterial formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein). DNA strand breaks were generated in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 1 microM and greater. In contrast, no significant increase in Fpg-sensitive sites was observed under our experimental conditions. However, the repair of Fpg-sensitive DNA lesions induced by visible light was slightly diminished at 1 microM and inhibited completely at 10 microM of cadmium(II), while the closure of DNA strand breaks was not affected. Our results show that, although cadmium is not able to induce oxidative DNA base modifications in larval brain cells directly, its capability to generate DNA strand breaks and to interfere with the repair of oxidative DNA damage could explain the early life stage neurotoxicity of this metal.

TI  - Effects of iron and temperature on expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa tolQRA genes: role of the ferric uptake regulator.  
AB  - The tolQRA genes have been recently identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. In this study, we examined the effect of iron and temperature on tolQRA expression. A promoterless lacZ gene was introduced downstream of plasmid-encoded tolQ and tolA, and expression was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity of cultures. Addition of 25 microM FeCl3 to the culture medium reduced tolQRA expression by 50 to 60% in PAO but by only 25% in the fur mutant PAO A4. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that iron regulation occurs at the level of transcription and involves the P. aeruginosa ferric uptake regulator (Fur). Primer extension analysis was used to identify the proposed transcriptional start site of tolA. Although a putative Fur box was identified 20 bp upstream of the proposed start site, purified Fur did not bind to the tolA or tolQR promoter regions in an in vitro gel retardation assay. Therefore, iron regulation of the tol genes appears to involve an intermediate regulatory gene. Expression of tolQR and tolA was optimal at 37 degrees C and was reduced by 40 to 50% when cultures were grown at either 42 or 25 degreesC.  Growth in high-iron medium at 25 degrees C further reduced tolQR and tolA expression.

TI  - Heterochronic processes in human evolution: an ontogenetic analysis of the hominid pelvis.  
AB  - Changes in pelvic shape in human ontogeny and hominid phylogeny suggest that the heterochronic processes involved differ greatly from the neotenic process traditionally described in the evolution of the skull. The morphology of 150 juvenile and adult pelves of African apes, 60 juvenile and adult pelves of modern humans, two adult pelves and a juvenile hip bone of australopithecines (Sts 14, AL 288, MLD 7) was studied. Multivariate results, ontogenetic allometries, and growth curves confirm that the pelvic growth pattern in humans differs markedly from those of the African apes. The results permit the following conclusions. First, the appearance of a new feature (acetabulo-cristal buttress and cristal tubercle) at the time of human birth allows the addition of traits, such as the attainment of a proportionally narrower pelvis, with more sagittally positioned iliac blades. Pelvic proportions and orientation change progressively in early childhood as bipedalism is practiced. Other changes in pelvic proportions occur later with the adolescent growth spurt. Second, comparison of juvenile and adult australopithecines to modern humans indicates that 1) some pelvic traits of adult Australopithecus resemble those of neonate Homo; 2) the pelvic growth of Australopithecus was probably closer to that of apes, than to that of humans; and 3) prolonged growth in length of hindlimb and pelvis after sexual maturity seems to be a unique feature of Homo. The position of the acetabulo-cristal buttress and of the cristal tubercle on the ilium are similar in adult Australopithecus and neonate Homo suggesting that this feature may have been displaced later during hominid evolution. Progressive displacement of the acetabulo-cristal buttress on the ilium occurs both during hominid evolution (from Australopithecus to Homo sapiens) and human growth (from neonate to adult). This suggests peramorphic evolution of the pelvic morphology of hominids combining three processes of recapitulation (pre-displacement, acceleration and time hypermorphosis). The results lend credence to the hypothesis that no single heterochronic process accounts for all human evolutionary change; rather this reflects a combination of relative changes in growth rhythm and duration, including other perturbations, such as the appearance of new morphological features.

TI  - Growth inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells by human cytidine deaminase requires the catalytic function of the protein.  
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that cytidine deaminase (CDD) is a potent growth inhibitor of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC). In this study, we have undertaken molecular cloning and purification of recombinant human CDD to elucidate the growth regulatory potential and mechanism behind the growth suppressive effect. The purified protein had a specific activity of 1.35 x 10(5) U/mg and a Km value of 30 micromol/L. In the GM-CFC assay, the recombinant protein was shown to reduce colony formation to 50% at 16 pmol/L concentration. Similarly, as was observed with CDD derived from granulocyte extract, the effect depended on the presence of thymidine (>/= 4 x 10(-5) mol/L). These results imply that CDD is an extremely potent inhibitor of GM-CFC and that no additional factor from the granulocyte extract is required for the growth inhibitory effect. Modification of CDD by truncation from the C-terminal end, or by amino acid substitution of an active site glutamate residue, eliminated both the enzyme activity and the growth regulatory potential of CDD. Furthermore, CDD from Escherichia coli was found to be even more effective than human CDD in growth suppression of GM-CFC, with 10-fold higher inhibitory activity corresponding to a 10-fold higher enzymatic activity. Taken together, these results show that the catalytic nucleoside deaminating function of the protein is essential for the growth suppressive effect of CDD. Most probably, CDD exerts growth inhibition by depleting the cytidine and deoxycytidine pool required for DNA synthesis, as addition of deoxycytidine monophosphate, which is not a substrate for CDD, neutralizes the inhibiting effect.

TI  - Heregulin-dependent autocrine loop regulates growth of K-ras but not erbB-2 transformed rat thyroid epithelial cells.  
AB  - The EGF-like family of proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin (BTC), cripto-1 (CR-1), and heregulin (HRG), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several human carcinomas as autocrine growth factors. Differentiation and proliferation of rat thyroid cells in culture (FRTL-5 cells) are regulated by thyrotropin (TSH); withdrawal of TSH from culture medium produces growth arrest, whereas its addition to quiescent cells stimulates cell entry into S phase. Instead, transformed thyroid cell lines as FRTL-5H2 cell line, overexpressing erbB-2, Kimol cells, transformed by the wild-type K-ras and A6 clone, transformed by a temperature sensitive K-ras mutant, can grow without addition of TSH to the culture medium. In order to identify whether EGF-like growth factors and corresponding receptors (erbB-2, erbB-3, and erbB-4) could be involved in the autonomous growth of these transformed rat thyroid epithelial cells, Northern blot for mRNA analysis and Western blot for protein expression were performed. In contrast to normal control FRTL-5 cells, both K-ras and erbB-2-transformed cells expressed elevated levels of erbB-2 receptor. Moreover, both K-ras transformed cells, Kimol and A6 cells, but no FRTL-5H2 cells, were found able to express also high levels of erbB-4 receptor and HRG/NDF ligand. Treatment of K-ras transformed thyroid cells with neutralizing antibody against HRG/NDF reduced by 50% cell proliferation. These data indicate that unlike the erbB-2 overexpressing FRTL-5 cells, in K-ras rat thyroid epithelial cells, the growth factor heregulin signals through the heterodimer erbB-2/erbB-4 receptors in an autocrine fashion.

TI  - DNA damage in mussels at sites in San Diego Bay.  
AB  - Identification and assessment of introduced and other toxicants is crucial to any comprehensive study of contaminants within the marine environment. The relationship between DNA single-strand breaks and the exposure of marine organisms to environmental contaminants was examined at sites in San Diego Bay, CA. A comprehensive assessment of the extent and consequences of marine environmental contamination in the area of Naval Station San Diego was conducted in the summer of 1995. The study addressed contamination sources, distributions, concentrations, transport, sediment-water exchange, biological effects, and degradation. The biological effects portion of the study (this paper) included contaminant bioaccumulation, organismal growth, and the determination of DNA single-strand breaks using the Comet assay. DNA damage was determined in hemocytes collected from deployed and resident mussels, Mytilus edulis, at six stations in and around the Naval Station San Diego. Deployed mussels were exposed on station for approximately 30 days in plastic mesh bags, placed 1 m above the bottom. Hemocyte samples were collected on days 0, 12, and 32. It was found that stations exhibiting the extremes of contaminant exposure, both highest and lowest concentrations, were easily identified using growth and DNA damage measurements. Sediment chemistry and bioaccumulation data indicated, Hg, Cu, and Zn, to be the most notable contaminants. The Comet assay, and in particular germ cell DNA damage determinations, were found to respond rapidly to station contaminants. Results from this study and an earlier 1993 study suggest that the non-sediment associated effects observed at one station may have been the result of the photoactivation of accumulated PAHs.

TI  - The effect of dietary protein level on the lysine and arginine requirements of growing chickens.  
AB  - Comparisons were made of the growth and carcass fat responses to dietary lysine and of the lysine requirements of 1-wk-old broiler chickens receiving diets containing either 18, 20, 23 or 25% protein. Similar comparisons were made of the responses elicited by dietary arginine in diets containing 18 or 23% dietary protein. The responses to lysine supplementation and the lysine requirements of chicks receiving 23 or 25% protein diets were similar. In comparing the 18 or 20% to the 23% protein diet, the initial responses of growth and feed efficiency to dietary lysine were augmented, but the maximal weight gain diminished as dietary protein decreased, leading to a decrease in the lysine requirements. The amounts of extractable carcass fat or abdominal fat pad increased as dietary protein was lowered and, in general, were reduced either by lysine or arginine supplementation. Percentage of pectoral muscle increased slightly with dietary arginine and protein supplementation. The results suggest that when total dietary amino acid level is reduced, the requirements for the individual amino acid decrease due to growth retardation resulting from single or multiple amino acid deficiencies. Single amino acid supplementation of low protein diet is more effective in improving the amino acid balance than supplementation of high protein diets, resulting in a further decrease in the requirements.

TI  - Morphological and functional evidence for enhanced growth and potassium-evoked dopamine release in striatal grafts innervated with a patchy growth pattern. An in oculo nigrostriatal cograft study.  
AB  - During development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, a patchy and a diffuse type of striatal innervation pattern can be seen. It has been suggested that when fetal dopaminergic neurons, obtained from the ventral mesencephalon (VM), are grafted adjacent to mature striatal tissue, only the diffuse growth is induced. Intraocular grafting studies have indicated that the dopaminergic growth pattern might be influenced by the age of the target area, the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). In this study VM grafts were allowed to innervate LGE grafts of different ages. Fetal VM was implanted next to 2-wk-old or 26-day-old striatal in oculo grafts, and the resulting dopaminergic innervation of the striatal grafts was studied using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. In striatal grafts receiving innervation at the age of 2 wk in oculo, a patchy TH-immunoreactive growth pattern was found, while in striatal grafts innervated at the age of 26 days mainly the diffuse growth pattern was seen. This implies that grafted striatum reached maturity at approximately 1 mo of age. The age of the dopaminergic neurons at dissection and grafting was also studied concerning the ability to induce patchy growth into mature striatum. Thus, VM dissected from 13- and 18-mm fetuses was implanted to either 4-mo-old LGE (grafted in sequence) or to LGE from the same fetus (grafted simultaneously) as controls. TH-positive innervation of striatal tissue, evaluated 4 wk after implantation of VM, revealed a patchy growth pattern in LGE grafted simultaneously with 13- and 18-mm VM. However, when the striatum was mature at the time of innervation, diffuse growth was observed in striatum innervated by VM dissected from 13-mm fetuses. Interestingly, patchy growth was noted in striatal areas close to VM grafts when the dopaminergic neurons were derived from older fetuses (CRL 18 mm). Furthermore, potassium-induced dopamine release was greater in striatal grafts exhibiting the patchy growth than those showing the diffuse pattern of innervation. In conclusion, patchy dopaminergic growth can be induced in mature striatal tissue by grafting VM from older fetuses. Functionally, potassium-evoked dopamine release is enhanced in dopaminergic patches. These results have implications in terms of finding ways to induce patchy growth when grafting to the mature striatum of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Deoxyspergualin preferentially inhibits the growth and maturation of anti-CD40-activated surface IgD+ B lymphocytes.  
AB  - Deoxyspergualin (DSG), an analogue of spermidin, is a potent immunosuppressive drug with an action quite distinct from that of cyclosporin, rapamycin, or FK506. In this study we investigated the effect of DSG and methyldeoxyspergualin (MeDSG) on the proliferation and differentiation of human B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 MoAb. Highly purified B cells obtained from tonsillar samples were used as target cells. Both agents inhibited the proliferative response of anti-CD40-stimulated B cells in the absence and presence of IL-4, IL-2 or IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect differed markedly among cell populations based on surface IgD expression: strong inhibition of sIgD+ B cells but little inhibition of sIgD- B cells. The drugs also suppressed the production of IgG, IgM and IgA by unfractionated B cells, which suggests that DSG acts against post-switch (sIgD-) B cells. Although the drugs suppressed immunoglobulin synthesis by both sIgD+ and sIgD- B cells, the effect was more marked in the sIgD+ B cells. Analysis of the subclass of IgG secreted by sIgD+ B cells revealed a decline in IgG1 and IgG3 in the presence of DSG. These results suggest that DSG preferentially inhibits the growth and maturation of sIgD+ naive B cells.

TI  - Cryopreservation and culture of human corneal keratocytes.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effects of two different concentrations of albumin in a cryoprotective solution and two freezing methods on human corneal keratocyte ctyopreservation. METHODS: Isolated keratocytes were used for cryopreservation. Solutions of 10% dimethylsulfoxide with either 2% or 10% human albumin were used as cryoprotective agents. Cells either were transferred directly into a -80 degrees C freezer (freezing rate, 2 degrees C/min) or were cooled in a programmed freezer (1 degrees C/min until -40 degrees C and then 10 degrees C/min), which resulted in four different cryopreservation protocols. Cells were stored at -80 degrees C, then were thawed at 37 degrees C, and subsequently were cultured. Keratocytes were studied by means of trypan blue staining, growth assay, apoptosis assays, transmission electron microscopy, and immunochemistry. RESULTS: The percentage of cells that were alive after thawing ranged from 80% to 99% by trypan blue staining and from 45% to 60% by flow cytometry. The ratio of the number of living cells at the end of primary culture after cryopreservation to that before cryopreservation was significantly (P=0.04) higher after direct transfer into the -80 degrees C freezer than after controlled-rate freezing, whereas the albumin concentration had no significant influence on this ratio (P=0.45). The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher after cryopreservation than in the control group of noncryopreserved cells; more than 5% 24 hours after thawing. Cryopreservation did not modify the keratocyte ultrastructure. Fibroblast growth factor dramatically decreased the serum-induced cell expression of alpha smooth muscle actin, whereas cryopreservation had no influence on this cell expression. CONCLUSIONS: A freeze-thaw trauma, which was related to cryopreservation-induced cell apoptosis, was revealed during primary culture after thawing. Direct transfer into the -80 degrees C freezer resulted in better postcryopreservation growth in the culture than controlled-rate freezing. A change in albumin concentration from 2% to 10% did not affect the results.

TI  - Establishment of prostatic cell line "Pro9ad" from a p53-deficient mouse.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: We demonstrated that p53-deficiency is sufficient for immortalization of fetal uterine cells. In the present study, we further extended our previous observations to prostate tissues from a young p53-deficient adult mouse. METHODS: Cell lines were established from the ventral prostate of a p53-deficient male mouse and maintained in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin (10 microg/ml), transferrin (10 microg/ml), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), and selenium (10(-8) M). RESULTS: Pro9ad, one of the lines established, exhibits a typical epithelial morphology in culture. Despite the possession of androgen receptors, the growth of Pro9ad was not stimulated by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) slightly stimulated proliferation, whereas fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB) had no stimulating effect on growth. However, FGF-2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) accelerated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. EGF and IGF-1 additively stimulated growth. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Pro9ad shares characteristics in common with primary prostatic epithelial cells despite p53-deficiency, and that p53-deficiency alone allows establishment of clonal cell lines of the prostate epithelium. Furthermore, the prostates of p53-deficient mice are useful sources for obtaining cell lines.

TI  - Puberty in the female tammar wallaby.  
AB  -  The growth and timing of female puberty in a seasonally breeding marsupial, the tammar wallaby, was examined in wild and captive animals. Puberty, defined as the time of first estrus and ovulation, can occur at any time of the year. Sixty percent of young wild females went through puberty in late October-November, 3 mo before the normal adult mating season in late January-February, but puberty was delayed in captive animals kept with a low ratio of males to females. During initial cycles, 19% of these captive animals were infertile as judged by failure to conceive. In the wild, puberty occurred well before the animals were fully grown (body weight 2.0+/-0.3 kg [mean+/-SD], n=23; adult females, 4.7+/-0.6 kg; n=34). Only 3% of animals with a body weight below 1.5 kg had ovulated. Thus, attainment of a minimum body weight was a key prerequisite associated with puberty. Progesterone concentrations in the peripheral plasma of prepubertal females were not significantly different from those of adult females during the nonbreeding season (prepubertal, 142+/-121 pg/ml, n=34; adult, 194+/-105 pg/ml, n=32, p > 0.05). However, there was a significant increase in progesterone (322+/-242 pg/ml, n=32, p < 0.05) in the postpubertal females (ovulating but still < 3.5 kg body weight) even though the corpus luteum was quiescent after its formation. There was no increase in plasma progesterone before the first estrus. These data confirm that estrus does not require a change in the progesterone:estradiol ratio, and that a "silent" ovulation does not precede the first estrus in this species, so that the onset of puberty coincides with the first behavioral estrus and ovulation, when the animals have reached a body weight of 2 kg. Although adult female tammars are strict seasonal breeders, with 6 mo of seasonal quiescence from the winter to the summer solstice, young females can go through puberty at any time of the year. The unique feature of the female tammar wallaby is that it does not become a seasonally breeding mammal until after puberty, when it has acquired a corpus luteum.

TI  - Effect of maternal carbohydrate metabolism on fetal growth.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of maternal carbohydrate metabolism and anthropometric characteristics on fetal growth. METHODS: Eight pregnant women in the third trimester with unexplained fetal growth restriction (FGR) and 11 women with normal pregnancies in the third trimester were evaluated for maternal carbohydrate metabolism, using oral glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. These data and maternal anthropometric characteristics subsequently were related to relative birth weight, defined as observed birth weight x 100/50th percentile birth weight. RESULTS: The women with FGR pregnancies were more insulin sensitive than were controls (21.6+/-4.4 versus 16.7+/-4.8 micromol/kg x min, P < .05) and showed reduced insulin and glucose areas under the curve (96,293+/-25,870 versus 145,291+/-49,356 pmol/L, P < .03; 1057.0+/-184.7 versus 1210.1 +/-85.9 mmol/L, P < .05, respectively). No differences were seen in fasting plasma glucose, insulin and human placental lactogen samples, age, height, pregravid weight, weight gain, and parity. In all patients, maternal insulin sensitivity and weight gain correlated well with relative birth weight (r =-.65, P < .002; r=.68, P < .001, respectively). When the same analysis was computed separately in the groups, insulin sensitivity exhibited a strong negative correlation with relative birth weight in the FGR group but not in controls (r=-.84, P < .007; r=-.54, P=.08, respectively). Conversely, in control women the best correlation between relative birth weight and the other variables studied was seen with maternal weight gain (r=.82, P < .002). CONCLUSION: Women with unexplained FGR have a different glucose metabolic pattern than do normals. We speculate that increased insulin sensitivity leads to a reduction in metabolic substrates for fetal growth.

TI  - Anaerobic regulation of Bacillus subtilis Krebs cycle genes.  
AB  - Krebs cycle enzyme activity in Bacillus subtilis was examined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Citrate synthase and aconitase activities in cells grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate were reduced by as much as 10- and 30-fold, respectively, from levels observed under aerobic culture conditions. The maximum level of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity during anaerobic growth was only twofold lower than that in aerobic cultures. These reductions in activity under conditions of anaerobiosis were found to be primarily the result of reduced Krebs cycle gene transcription. This repression was not dependent on either the fnr or resDE gene products, which have been shown to regulate expression of other B. subtilis genes in response to anaerobic conditions. Additionally, catabolite control proteins CcpA and CcpB were not responsible for the repression. A dyad symmetry element located between positions -73 and -59 relative to the transcription start site of the aconitase gene (citB) promoter was previously shown to be a target of catabolite repression and the binding site for a putative negative regulator during aerobic growth. The deletion of the upstream arm of the dyad symmetry region abolished the citB repression observed during anaerobic growth. Furthermore, neither citZ or citB was repressed in an anaerobically grown citB mutant, an effect that was very likely the result of citrate accumulation. These results suggest that catabolite repression and anaerobic repression of citZ and citB are regulated by a common mechanism that does not involve CcpA, CcpB, Fnr, or ResDE.

TI  - A general module for RNA crystallization.  
AB  - Crystallization of RNA molecules other than simple oligonucleotide duplexes remains a challenging step in structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Subjecting biochemically, covalently and conformationally homogeneous target molecules to an exhaustive array of crystallization conditions is often insufficient to yield crystals large enough for X-ray data collection. Even when large RNA crystals are obtained, they often do not diffract X-rays to resolutions that would lead to biochemically informative structures. We reasoned that a well-folded RNA molecule would typically present a largely undifferentiated molecular surface dominated by the phosphate backbone. During crystal nucleation and growth, this might result in neighboring molecules packing subtly out of register, leading to premature crystal growth cessation and disorder. To overcome this problem, we have developed a crystallization module consisting of a normally intramolecular RNA-RNA interaction that is recruited to make an intermolecular crystal contact. The target RNA molecule is engineered to contain this module at sites that do not affect biochemical activity. The presence of the crystallization module appears to drive crystal growth, in the course of which other, non-designed contacts are made. We have employed the GAAA tetraloop/tetraloop receptor interaction successfully to crystallize numerous group II intron domain 5-domain 6, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme RNA constructs. The use of the module allows facile growth of large crystals, making it practical to screen a large number of crystal forms for favorable diffraction properties. The method has led to group II intron domain crystals that diffract X-radiation to 3.5 A resolution.

TI  - Tocotrienols inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells irrespective of estrogen receptor status.  
AB  - Potential antiproliferative effects of tocotrienols, the major vitamin E component in palm oil, were investigated on the growth of both estrogen-responsive (ER+) MCF7 human breast cancer cells and estrogen-unresponsive (ER-) MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, and effects were compared with those of alpha-tocopherol (alphaT). The tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil inhibited growth of MCF7 cells in both the presence and absence of estradiol with a nonlinear dose-response but such that complete suppression of growth was achieved at 8 microg/mL. MDA-MB-231 cells were also inhibited by TRF but with a linear dose-response such that 20 microg/mL TRF was needed for complete growth suppression. Separation of the TRF into individual tocotrienols revealed that all fractions could inhibit growth of both ER+ and ER- cells and of ER+ cells in both the presence and absence of estradiol. However, the gamma- and delta-fractions were the most inhibitory. Complete inhibition of MCF7 cell growth was achieved at 6 microg/mL of gamma-tocotrienol/delta-tocotrienol (gammaT3/deltaT3) in the absence of estradiol and 10 microg/mL of deltaT3 in the presence of estradiol, whereas complete suppression of MDA-MB-231 cell growth was not achieved even at concentrations of 10 microg/mL of deltaT3. By contrast to these inhibitory effects of tocotrienols, alphaT had no inhibitory effect on MCF7 cell growth in either the presence or the absence of estradiol, nor on MDA-MB-231 cell growth. These results confirm studies using other sublines of human breast cancer cells and demonstrate that tocotrienols can exert direct inhibitory effects on the growth of breast cancer cells. In searching for the mechanism of inhibition, studies of the effects of TRF on estrogen-regulated pS2 gene expression in MCF7 cells showed that tocotrienols do not act via an estrogen receptor-mediated pathway and must therefore act differently from estrogen antagonists. Furthermore, tocotrienols did not increase levels of growth-inhibitory insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) in MCF7 cells, implying also a different mechanism from that proposed for retinoic acid inhibition of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell growth. Inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells by tocotrienols could have important clinical implications not only because tocotrienols are able to inhibit the growth of both ER+ and ER- phenotypes but also because ER+ cells could be growth-inhibited in the presence as well as in the absence of estradiol. Future clinical applications of TRF could come from potential growth suppression of ER+ breast cancer cells otherwise resistant to growth inhibition by antiestrogens and retinoic acid.

TI  - Suppression of hypercholesterolemia in hepatoma-bearing rats by cabbage extract and its component, S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide.  
AB  - The effect of cabbage extract on cholesterol metabolism was studied in Donryu rats subcutaneously implanted with an ascites hepatoma cell line (AH109A). The hepatoma-bearing rats exhibited hypercholesterolemia induced by increasing cholesterogenesis in the host liver and decreasing steroid excretion into feces. The cabbage extract intake or administration reduced serum cholesterol level and enhanced fecal bile acid excretion and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid biosynthesis, in the microsomal fraction of the liver. Furthermore, S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide, a component of cabbage, could mimic the effect of cabbage extract when orally administered. These results suggest that cabbage suppresses hypercholesterolemia responding to hepatoma growth by upregulating cholesterol catabolism and that S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide in cabbage is one of the factors suppressing hypercholesterolemia in the hepatoma-bearing rats.

TI  - Biology of somatotropin in growth and lactation of domestic animals.  
AB  - Impressive progress has been made during the past 15 years in our understanding of the biology of somatotropin (ST) in domestic animals. In part, this progress was sparked by advances in biotechnology that made feasible the production of large quantities of recombinant bovine ST (bST) and porcine ST (pST). The availability of recombinant bST and pST resulted in an exponential increase in investigations that explored their role in growth and lactation biology, as well as evaluated their potential for commercial use. Collectively, these studies established that administration of bST to lactating dairy cows increased milk yield, and treatment of growing pigs with pST markedly stimulated muscle growth and reduced fat deposition. In addition to these "efficacy" studies, a substantial number of investigations examined the mechanisms by which ST affects lactation and growth of domestic animals. This review summarizes the diverse physiological effects ST has on growth and lactation and discusses the underlying mechanisms that mediate these effects in domestic animals.

TI  - Positive versus negative signaling by lymphocyte antigen receptors.  
AB  - Antigen receptors on lymphocytes play a central role in immune regulation by transmitting signals that positively or negatively regulate lymphocyte survival, migration, growth, and differentiation. This review focuses on how opposing positive or negative cellular responses are brought about by antigen receptor signaling. Four types of extracellular inputs shape the response to antigen: (a) the concentration of antigen; (b) the avidity with which antigen is bound; (c) the timing and duration of antigen encounter; and (d) the association of antigen with costimuli from pathogens, the innate immune system, or other lymphocytes. Intracellular signaling by antigen receptors is not an all-or-none event, and these external variables alter both the quantity and quality of signaling. Recent findings in B lymphocytes have clearly illustrated that these external inputs affect the magnitude and duration of the intracellular calcium response, which in turn contributes to differential triggering of the transcriptional regulators NF kappa B, JNK, NFAT, and ERK. The regulation of calcium responses involves a network of tyrosine kinases (e.g. lyn, syk), tyrosine or lipid phosphatases (CD45, SHP-1, SHIP), and accessory molecules (CD21/CD19, CD22, FcR gamma 2b). Understanding the biochemistry and logic behind these integrative processes will allow development of more selective and efficient pharmaceuticals that suppress, modify, or augment immune responses in autoimmunity, transplantation, allergy, vaccines, and cancer.

TI  - Influence of weight, age and puberty on bone size and bone mineral content in healthy children and adolescents.  
AB  - The biology of bone mineralization during growth is important for peak bone mass. The aim of the study was to examine how body size, age and puberty influence bone size and bone mineral density. Whole body bone area (BA) and bone mineral content (BMC) were examined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic 1000/W) in healthy girls (n = 201) and boys (n = 142) aged 5-19 y. The influence of height, weight, age and puberty on bone mineralization was examined by multiple regression. Main determinants of BA were height and weight. Bone width, approximated by BA corrected for height, increased highly significantly with weight and depended weakly significantly on pubertal stage. Main determinants of BMC were BA, height, age and pubertal stages. Bone mineral density, approximated by BMC corrected for BA and height, depended on age and pubertal stage, but not on weight. Thus skeletal size is mainly determined by body size, while bone density is determined by age and pubertal stage.

TI  - HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein and morphine-tubular cell interaction products modulate kidney fibroblast proliferation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal interstitial scarring is an important feature of HIV-associated nephropathy. Intravenous drug abuse has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the development of HIV-associated nephropathy in patients with HIV infection. We studied the effect of tubular cell-morphine and/or HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein interaction products on kidney fibroblast (KF) proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: Tubular cell-morphine and/or gp120 interaction products were prepared by incubating confluent human proximal tubular cells with buffer (TCP), morphine (10(-3) mol/L) (TCM-IP), gp120 (0.01 microgram/mL)(TC-120IP), or morphine (10(-3) mol/L) + gpl20 (0.01 microgram/mL) (TCM-120IP). To evaluate the effect of tubular cell interaction products (TCIP) on KF proliferation, growth arrested kidney fibroblasts were treated with variable concentrations (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50%) of TCP, TCM-IP, TC-120IP, or TCM-120IP for 48 hours. To evaluate the role of cytokines in TCIP-induced KF proliferation, cells were incubated with TCIP with or without cytokine neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, FGF, or IL-6 for 48 hours. Subsequently, cells were counted in a hemocytometer (n = 3). To evaluate the effect of TCIP on KF apoptosis, cells were treated with 50% TCP, 50% TCM-IP, 50% TC-120IP, or 50% TCM-120IP for 24 hours and stained with H-33342 and propidium iodide. In parallel experiments KFs were harvested under identical conditions, DNA was isolated and run on gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the role of early growth genes in TCM-120-induced KF proliferation, TCM-120IP-treated cells were probed with cDNA for c-fos and c-jun. RESULTS: TC-120IP at a lower concentration (20%) enhanced (P < 0.001) proliferation of KF when compared with TCP. TCM-IP did not stimulate KF proliferation. On the contrary, TCM-120IP at a lower concentration (20%) promoted (P < 0.001) KF proliferation when compared with TCP, TCM-IP and TC-120IP. TCM-120IP at a lower concentration (20%) also enhanced KF mRNA expression of c-fos and c-jun. TCM-120IP enhanced KF proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. All tubular cell interaction products at a higher concentration (50%) promoted apoptosis of KF. CONCLUSIONS: Tubular cell-gp120 interaction products stimulated KF proliferation. Morphine amplified the effect of tubular cell-gp120 interaction on the proliferation of KF. TCM-120IP-induced KF proliferation may be mediated through the expression of early growth genes; whereas TCM-120IP-induced KF growth suppression may be mediated through the induction of apoptosis.

TI  - A role for phospholipase D (Pld1p) in growth, secretion, and regulation of membrane lipid synthesis in yeast.  
AB  - The SEC14 gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein essential for secretion and growth in yeast (1). Mutations (cki1, cct1, and cpt1) in the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis suppress the sec14 growth defect (2), permitting sec14(ts) cki1, sec14(ts) cct1, and sec14(ts) cpt1 strains to grow at the sec14(ts) restrictive temperature. Previously, we reported that these double mutant strains also excrete the phospholipid metabolites, choline and inositol (3). We now report that these choline and inositol excretion phenotypes are eliminated when the SPO14 (PLD1) gene encoding phospholipase D1 is deleted. In contrast to sec14(ts) cki1 strains, sec14(ts) cki1 pld1 strains are not viable at the sec14(ts) restrictive temperature and exhibit a pattern of invertase secretion comparable with sec14(ts) strains. Thus, the PLD1 gene product appears to play an essential role in the suppression of the sec14(ts) defect by CDP-choline pathway mutations, indicating a role for phospholipase D1 in growth and secretion. Furthermore, sec14(ts) strains exhibit elevated Ca2+-independent, phophatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-stimulated phospholipase D activity. We also propose that phospholipase D1-mediated phosphatidylcholine turnover generates a signal that activates transcription of INO1, the structural gene for inositol 1-phosphate synthase.

TI  - Mutual interactions between p53 and growth factors in cancer.  
AB  - The function of p53 tumour suppressor protein is determined by various intrinsic properties of the protein. The effect of p53 DNA-binding, and protein-protein interactions are determined by the conformation of the protein. Thus, p53 fulfils its role in cell cycle control and the onset of apoptotic cell death, which is altered when the wild-type p53 (wt-p53) conformation is changed due to mutation. This review focuses on the communal interactions of wt- and mutant p53 (m-p53) with growth factors and shows that m-p53 affects different cell biological functions that determine the malignant behaviour of cells. P53, for instance, affects the response of cells to growth factors and growth factor-withdrawal. Furthermore, p53 is involved in the expression of several growth factor- and growth factor receptor genes. These data suggest that restoration of the wt-p53 phenotype in tumour cells with m-53 might not only affect cell cycle control and apoptotic mechanisms but could also reduce autocrine growth and restore sensitivity to physiological growth inhibitors.

AB  - How cells generate and orientate polarized growth is of fundamental importance to understanding cell morphogenesis. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have both been used for genetic analysis of cell morphogenesis. Generation and maintenance of their cell shape require the formation of polarized growth sites and the correct localization of these growth sites on the cell surface with respect to other cellular structures. In this review, the authors discuss and compare the mechanisms used by the two yeasts to achieve polarized growth.

TI  - Evaluation of an acriflavine disk assay for differentiating Staphylococcus aureus from other staphylococci isolated from bovine milk.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an acriflavine disk assay for identification of Staphylococcus aureus and to test whether the acriflavine disk assay could be used to differentiate S aureus from other staphylococci isolated from bovine milk samples. DESIGN: Prospective study. SAMPLE POPULATION: 882 staphylococcal isolates from bovine milk samples and 3 S intermedius isolates from dogs. PROCEDURE: Paper disks saturated with various amounts of acriflavine were used in a growth inhibition assay to determine the amount of acriflavine that would most reliably differentiate S aureus from other staphylococci. For all isolates, hemolytic pattern, results of tube coagulase tests after 4 and 24 hours of incubation, growth on acriflavine-supplemented media, results of an acriflavine disk assay, and results of an automated identification system were determined. RESULTS: 10 micrograms of acriflavine/disk was determined to be the most appropriate concentration for use in the assay. All 112 isolates identified as S aureus by the automated identification system were resistant to this concentration of acriflavine, and only 1 of 236 isolates identified as non-S aureus staphylococci was resistant. There was substantial agreement between results of using the acriflavine disk assay as a diagnostic criterion for differntiating S aureus isolates from non-S aureus staphylococci and results of the automated identification system. Agreement between results of determining hemolytic pattern and results of other diagnostic tests was only moderate. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The acriflavine disk assay, using 10 micrograms of acriflavine/disk, was a practical, accurate method for differentiating S aureus isolates from non-S aureus staphylococci.

TI  - In vitro toxicity of A 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and hydroxyurea combination on normal myeloid progenitors.  
AB  - Hydroxyurea (HU) appears to increase 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) antiretroviral activity and cytotoxicity by inhibiting thymidilate synthesis. The combination of AZT and HU may therefore be of clinical usefulness. We evaluated the in vitro hemotoxicities of different combinations of AZT and HU in comparison with the hemotoxicities exerted by either of the two drugs alone. Peripheral blood granulocyte macrophage committed progenitors (CFU-GM) of healthy donors were selected as targets of hemotoxicity. Both AZT and HU separately had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of normal circulating CFU-GM. The combination of the two drugs induced a statistically significant synergistic cytotoxicity. In fact, addition of HU induced a remarkable reduction of AZT ID50. Thus, future clinical application of AZT, HU combination should take into account the greater hemosuppressive action of the combination in respect to that observed following administration of either drug alone.

TI  - Phenol toxicity in leukemia cells: a radical process?  
AB  - The multiple functions of the phenol moiety that are widely present in disparate sources such as drugs, pesticides, teas, fuel additives and surfactants have not been clearly delineated. The differences in behavior of phenols, which run the gamut from aberrations in DNA/chromosomes to suppression of genotoxic activity of carcinogenic compounds, merit further attention. In this study, a through examination of the growth inhibition patterns of 37, simple 3- and 4-substituted phenols in mouse leukemia cells was carried out and the following quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was obtained for the 23 electron releasing substituents in X-phenols: log 1/IC50 = -1.58 sigma(+) +0.21 log P + 3.10. In this QSAR, IC50 is the concentration of phenol that induces 50% inhibition of growth. P is a measure of the hydrophobicity of each phenol and Brown's electronic parameter, sigma+, represents the electronic effect of the substituent. The negative dependence on sigma+ is strongly reminiscent of what is observed in the developmental toxicity of phenols on rat embryos as well as for the radical abstraction of a hydrogen atom from phenolic groups. The other 15 electron-attracting substituted X-phenols clearly show a linear dependence on hydrophobicity alone: Log 1/IC50 = 0.62 log P + 2.35. The bifurcation in mechanism of action of this large set of diverse phenols is novel and unusual. It suggests that two distinct processes are operative. In the case of electron releasing substituted phenols, the observations are not inconsistent with a radical mediated process while with electron attracting substituted phenols, non-specific toxicity as modulated by hydrophobicity, appears to predominate.

AB  - Deep subterranean granitic aquifers have not been explored regarding methanogens until now. Three autotrophic methane-producing Archaea were isolated from deep granitic groundwater at depths of 68, 409 and 420 m. These organisms were non-motile, small, thin rods, 0.1-0.15 micron in diameter, and they could use hydrogen and carbon dioxide or formate as substrates for growth and methanogenesis. One of the isolates, denoted A8p, was studied in detail. It grew with a doubling time of 2.5 h under optimal conditions (20-40 degrees C, pH 7.8-8.8 and 0.2-1.2 M NaCl). Strain A8p is eurythermic as it grew between 3.6 and 45 degrees C. It was resistant to up to 20 mg bacitracin l-1. The G + C content was 54.5 mol%, as determined by thermal denaturation. Phylogenetic studies based upon 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons placed the isolate A8p in the genus Methanobacterium. Phenotypic and phylogenetic characters indicate that the alkaliphilic, halotolerant strain A8p represents a new species. We propose the name Methanobacterium subterraneum for this species, and strain A8p (= DSM 11074T) is the type strain.

TI  - Clinical and radiological predictors of complete excision in breast-conserving surgery for primary breast cancer.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Local recurrence after conservative surgery for breast cancer usually results from growth of residual cancer adjacent to the excised primary tumour or from multicentric disease. Complete local excision (CLE) confirmed histologically is essential to ensure that the risk of local recurrence is minimal. This study was undertaken to determine that clinical or radiological factors may assist the surgeon at the time of surgery to achieve this aim. METHODS: A retrospective review of 101 cases treated by conservative surgery identified 70 cases of CLE and 31 of incomplete local excision (ILE). Clinical, surgical and histopathological data were taken from hospital records. Mammographic features and those of specimen X-rays were evaluated without knowledge of the histopathological outcome of surgery. RESULTS: Complete excision was significantly associated with type of operation (lumpectomy vs wide local excision/quadrantectomy, P < 0.003), absence of calcification (P < 0.03) and the presence of a mass on mammography (P = 0.05). Tumour size (> 2.5 cm) and the presence of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were associated with incomplete excision (P = 0.0005). No relationship was demonstrated with patient age, breast size, breast density, tumour grade, receptor status, axillary nodal status or spicules on X-ray and completeness of excision. Specimen X-ray had a positive predictive value of 94% with CLE. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and pre-operative mammographic parameters are important for predicting CLE for breast cancers treated by breast-conserving surgery. Specimen radiology for palpable lesions can confirm excision of the cancer and permit re-excision of breast tissue at the time of initial surgery. Its role in determining CLE should be further evaluated.

TI  - Crohn's disease in adolescents.  
AB  - The clinical features of Crohn's disease manifest during adolescence are varied as in adults. The potential complication of growth impairment and concomitant delay in pubertal development is unique to this population. Cytokines released from the inflamed bowel and chronic nutritional insufficiency are the major factors in the pathophysiology of growth inhibition. Hence reduction of intestinal inflammation and consistent provision of adequate nutrition are of paramount importance in management. Drug treatment mirrors that of adults; few specifically paediatric clinical trials have been conducted. Enteral nutrition is an important therapeutic alternative for young patients. There is evidence that it constitutes both a primary therapy of inflammation and a means of providing the calories needed for growth. In the setting of extensive disease, dependency on corticosteroids should be minimized through judicious administration of immunosuppressive drugs. For an adolescent with localized stenotic disease, optimal management includes a timely referral for intestinal resection as a means of providing an asymptomatic interval during which growth and pubertal development can normalize.

TI  - Effect of lithium gamma-linolenate on the growth of experimental human pancreatic carcinoma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lithium salt of gamma-linolenic acid (Li-GLA) is growth inhibitory to pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and is reported to prolong the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. The effect of Li-GLA on the growth of human pancreatic carcinoma in vivo is not known. In this study the effect of parenterally administered Li-GLA on the growth of human pancreatic carcinoma in nude mice was tested. METHODS: Pancreatic tumours were produced in nude mice by subcutaneous implantation of MIA PaCa-2 cells. This cell line is sensitive to Li-GLA in vitro. Mice were randomly treated with intraperitoneal, intravenous or intratumoral Li-GLA. Each group also had controls. RESULTS: Both intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of Li-GLA had no significant effect on tumour growth or tumour phospholipid fatty acid composition. Intratumoral administration of Li-GLA was, however, associated with a significant antitumour effect. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this tumour model, the benefit seen with intravenous Li-GLA in patients with pancreatic carcinoma cannot be explained by tumour growth inhibition. Local administration appears to be more effective than intravenous or intraperitoneal therapy.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of Thermococcus barossii, sp. nov., a hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from a hydrothermal vent flange formation.  
AB  - A new hyperthermophilic microorganism, Thermococcus barossii, was isolated from rock fragments of a hydrothermal vent flange formation, located along the East Pacific Rise of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This organism is obligately anaerobic and grows over a temperature range of at least 60-92 degrees C in artificial seawater-based media, containing elemental sulfur, tryptone and yeast extract. The addition of a maltooligosaccharide mixture and tungsten to this medium improved growth to some extent. At the Topt for growth (82.5 degrees C), cell densities as high as 4 x 10(8) cells/ml could be obtained in 18-liter batch fermentations, with a doubling time of approximately 40 minutes, if culture access to elemental sulfur was sufficient. In continuous culture at the same temperature, comparable cell densities could be obtained but only at slower growth rates. Morphologically, T. barossii is coccoid-shaped, forming irregularly-shaped spheres; under optimal conditions, these coccoids become more regular and smaller, a characteristic of other hyperthermophilic archaea. Negatively-stained preparations showed no pili or flagella associated with the cell surface. 16S rRNA sequencing reveals that T. barossii is most similar to Thermococcus celer (99.7%). Yet, further comparisons with T. celer showed that T. barossii is a new Thermococcus species: different growth temperature optimum (82.5 degrees C vs. 88 degrees C), obligate requirement for sulfur, higher G + C content (60% vs. 56.7%) and 47.7% DNA-DNA hybridization. The nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence for the gene encoding a DNA polymerase from T. barossii was compared to sequences of related genes from other Thermacoccales. The polymerase phylogenies were congruent with those obtained from the 16S rRNA phylogenetic analyses. Based on the high degree of similarity among members of the genus Termococcus for the criteria used thus far, aspects of enzymology may be an important mechanism of differenting one species from another.

TI  - Characteristics of the estrous cycle and antioxidant status of lactating Holstein cows exposed to heat stress.  
AB  - Follicular growth, lifespan of the corpus luteum, and antioxidant status of lactating Holsteins that experienced heat stress were monitored. Eleven multiparous cows, 60 to 110 d in milk, were maintained from 0800 to 1800 h daily in environmental chambers from d 11 to 21 of the estrous cycle. Cows were randomly assigned to a heat stress (mean dry bulb temperature peaked at 38.3 degrees C) or control treatment (mean dry bulb temperatures varied from 20.8 to 25.6 degrees C). Rectal temperature and respiration rates of heat-stressed cows were higher at 1600 h than were those of control cows. The length of the estrous cycle and the interval from estrus until luteolysis were not different between treatments. Two of 6 control cows and 1 of 5 heat-stressed cows had extended cycles (> 24 d). Heat-stressed cows had more class 1 (2 to 5 mm) follicles from d 11 to 15 of the estrous cycle. Numbers of class 2 (6 to 9 mm) and class 3 (> or = 9 mm) follicles were similar between treatments. Plasma progesterone concentrations were higher for heat-stressed cows until d 19 of the estrous cycle. Treatment did not affect concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, retinyl palmitate, or total protein in plasma or concentrations of malondialdehyde in muscle. In conclusion, heat stress did not extend luteal function or the length of the estrous cycle of lactating Holstein cows but did affect follicular growth and progesterone concentrations in plasma. Heat stress did not appear to increase lipid peroxidation or decrease lipid-soluble antioxidant concentrations in blood.

TI  - Yeasts isolated from the intestine of rainbow trout adhere to and grow in intestinal mucus.  
AB  - The yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS 7764 and Debaryomyces hansenii Hf1 (CBS 8339), isolated from the intestine of rainbow trout, were studied with respect to adhesion to and growth in fish intestinal mucus. The level of adhesion was dependent on the physiologic state of the yeast culture. Growing cells of both strains adhered more strongly than nongrowing cells. This correlates with a previously shown shift in cell surface hydrophobicity of these yeasts. In addition, forces other than hydrophobic interactions may participate, as all strains tested adhered more strongly to the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine than to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Debaryomyces hansenii Hf1 also adhered to the most hydrophobic of the neutral lipids present in mucus, while no adhesion was observed to the other neutral lipids or to the hydrophilic silica gel, again suggesting hydrophobic interactions. Finally, the fish-isolated yeasts grew rapidly in isolated fish intestinal mucus as the sole source of energy and nutrients.
