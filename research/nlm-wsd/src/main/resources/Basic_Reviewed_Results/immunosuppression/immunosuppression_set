TI  - The effect of chronic alcohol use on the heart before and after transplantation in an experimental model in the rat.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol has potential deleterious effects on donor heart function. This study was conducted in rats to determine whether long-term alcohol ingestion produces impaired hemodynamic performance while maintaining a normal left ventricular ejection fraction in donor hearts before transplantation and whether donor cardiac function is affected after heart transplantation. METHODS: Rats fed 30% alcohol in their drinking water for 12 weeks were compared with rats fed a normal diet. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured by echocardiography with Simpson and single plane Dodge formulas in living sedated rats after 10 and 12 weeks of alcohol feeding. Explanted heart function was assessed before and 3 days after heterotopic heart transplantation (no immunosuppression) with a Langendorff preparation. RESULTS: Blood ethanol levels at 4 and 8 weeks were 0.08 +/- 0.04 and 0.08 +/- 0.09 gm/dl. Left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in the group fed an alcohol diet for 12 weeks when compared with the control group (65.4% +/- 1.6% vs. 66.5% +/- 2.9%, p = 0.33). Explanted alcohol-fed hearts before transplantation had significantly lower maximum and developed pressures and had a blunted response to 0.1 ml 10(-9) mol/L isoproterenol. After transplantation alcohol-fed hearts had significantly lower maximum and developed pressures and decreased maximum rates of pressure rise and pressure decline. Allografts (ACI to Lewis) exhibited decreased function in comparison with isografts (ACI to ACI). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol feeding for 12 weeks in rats does not affect pretransplantation left ventricular ejection fraction, but it impairs explanted heart function, both before and after transplantation, resulting in a subclinical cardiomyopathy that is worsened by the presence of allograft rejection. Long-term alcohol exposure and rejection have independent, additive detrimental effects on left ventricular performance of the transplanted heart. Alcohol-exposed hearts may not be suitable donors.

TI  - Recurrent vascular thrombosis in an adolescent transplant recipient.  
AB  - Vascular thrombosis is one of the more difficult problems of pediatric renal transplantation; its etiology in multifactorial and, in most cases, it is irreversible. Vascular thrombosis accounts for 12.9% of graft failures in primary transplants in children and for 20% of graft failures in repeat transplants. Although it is seen most often in very young recipients and in recipients of kidneys from young donors, it can manifest in older children and adolescents as well. The peak incidence is seen in the first 48 h after transplantation; however, the event may be delayed until after the first week. When thrombosis occurs in an adolescent patients late in the course of transplantation, the pathogenesis is undetermined and immunosuppressive therapy is frequently implicated. This article describes a 19-yr-old patient with a three-antigen-matched cadaveric kidney who received cyclosporine and anti-thymocyte globulin for induction. Vascular thrombosis occurred after 7 d of initial good function. Eventually the graft was removed after attempts to re-establish vascularization failed. The patient received a second graft and despite an optimal six-antigen-match and different immunosuppression with tacrolimus, thrombosis recurred by the fifth postoperative day. The discussion that follows reviews the incidence and the factors implicated in the pathogenesis of this entity.

TI  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for human herpesvirus diagnosis and measurement of Epstein-Barr virus burden in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  
AB  - Human herpesviruses can cause acute diseases such as chicken pox or mononucleosis, but also may reactivate during immunosuppression and result in severe or life-threatening illnesses such as shingles or lymphoproliferative disorders. We report the development and validation of a quantitative PCR method to measure viral burden for all eight human herpesviruses (HSV1, HSV2, VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, HHV7, and KSHV) in patients' samples. The method uses an internal standard that is coamplified with the viral target, allowing quantification of viral genomes in absolute terms (e.g., viral targets/mL of blood) and ruling out false-negative results. We demonstrate that transplant patients with lymphoproliferative disorder carry an EBV viral burden 3 logs higher than nontransplant patients. EBV titers in transplant patients without a lymphoproliferative disorder are between these values. This quantitative PCR method may aid in differentiating clinically significant vs latent viral burden in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  - Peripancreatic fluid cytology: detection of early rejection versus graft pancreatitis after canine pancreatic transplantation.  
AB  - It is particularly difficult to distinguish between early rejection and graft pancreatitis when early rejection produces an elevated serum amylase level. In this study we determined whether peripancreatic fluid cytology (PFC) can differentiate early acute rejection and graft pancreatitis as an alternative diagnostic tool to graft biopsy that has the potential of pancreatic fistula and hemorrhage. Sixty-two dogs received either a segmental pancreas allograft (n = 25) or autograft (n = 37) heterotopically in the neck. This study included five groups: allografts without immunosuppression (group A, n = 12), allografts with immunosuppression (group B, n = 13), autografts without immunosuppression (group C, n = 11), autografts with immunosuppression (group D, n = 12), and autografts treated by 45 minutes of pretransplant warm ischemia to induce acute graft pancreatitis (group E, n = 14). A closed suction drainage catheter was placed next to the graft to collect peripancreatic fluid daily after the transplant. PFC was performed using May-Gruenwald-Giemsa double-staining technique and compared to the corresponding histology through the observation period. In analyses of 50 functioning grafts, PFC performed on day 1 showed similar neutrophil accumulations in all groups. In sharp contrast, on days 3 and 6, group A had dramatically increased mononuclear cell concentrations in PFC, whereas groups B, C, and D showed significantly lower concentrations, the percent of mononuclear cells among total leukocytes being 47.3 +/- 23.4%, 11.8 +/- 4.9%, 4.3 +/- 1.8%, and 6.4 +/- 2.4% (day 3); and 32.7 +/- 9.8%, 10.5 +/- 4.8%, 7.2 +/- 4.2%, and 8.6 +/- 6.4% (day 6) in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. On the other hand, in group E numerous degenerating neutrophils with a marked to moderate increase in necrotic tissue fragments were observed by PFC on days 3 and 6. In terms of graft histology on days 3 and 6, group A showed interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration indicating an acute rejection process, whereas groups B, C, and D had minimal inflammatory cell infiltration. In group E graft pancreatitis was histologically confirmed on days 3 and 6. These results suggest that PFC after pancreas transplantation could be a safe, simple, useful diagnostic tool for discriminating early graft rejection from graft pancreatitis.

TI  - A model of human anti-T-cell monoclonal antibody therapy in SCID mice engrafted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes.  
AB  - A chimeric severe combined immunodeficient mouse engrafted with human peripheral blood (hu-PBL-SCID) model has been developed to test anti-T-cell monoclonal antibody (mAb) effects on systemic symptoms of the host and the survival of human skin grafts. To obtain consistent engraftment without lethal acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), SCID mice were pretreated with a combination of total body irradiation (2.5 Gy, day 0) and anti-asialo GM1 (anti-mouse natural killer cell) antiserum (50 micrograms i.p., day 3) before the intraperitoneal injection of 40-50 X 10(6) human PBL on day 4. With this protocol, the engraftment rate was 82% with 5-98% human CD45-positive cells in the peripheral blood. Mortality at 30 days was 0% in the mice bearing 5-50% human cells compared with 70% in those with more than 50%. Using hu-PBL-SCID mice with 5-50% human cells in their peripheral blood, we demonstrated the following results: 1) Human T cells isolated from these mice proliferated in response to immobilized OKT3 stimulation in vitro. 2) Hu-PBL-SCID mice but not normal SCID mice were able to reject human skin grafts in vivo 16-21 days after grafting. 3) Both OKT3 (anti-human CD3 mAb) and T10B9 (anti-human alpha beta T-cell receptor mAb) treatment prevented human skin graft rejection in hu-PBL-SCID mice. 4) OKT3 but not T10B9 induced first dose reactions characterized by hypothermia and hypoactivity which were consistently observed within 90 min of intravenous injection into hu-PBL-SCID mice. 5) Human cytokines were detected in the serum of the hu-PBL-SCID mice treated with anti-T-cell mAbs. The close similarity of these responses to human clinical mAb immunosuppressive therapy suggests that the hu-PBL-SCID mouse model may be an excellent tool for investigating the immunosuppression, side effects, and mechanism of action of agents that are specific for human and higher apes and not reactive with lower animals.

TI  - Respiratory infections in patients with HIV infection.  
AB  - Changes in epidemiology have influenced the spectrum of pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected populations. The increasing proportion of patients with AIDS who are intravenous drug users and members of racial or ethnic minorities correlate with increasing cases of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis. Both of these infections also occur more frequently with advanced immunosuppression. Antipneumocystis prophylaxis is also reducing the incidence and mortality rate from this infection, but when respiratory failure occurs with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the mortality rate is high. Immunosuppression due to HIV causes active tuberculosis in many, and tuberculosis appears to accelerate the course of HIV disease. Directly observed therapy of tuberculosis has made a major impact on the incidence and cure rates of tuberculosis in areas of high prevalence. Pulmonary disease has been a major cause of illness and death in patients with HIV infection since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Early in the epidemic, P. carinii pneumonia was considered the predominant pulmonary disorder. However, epidemiologic shifts and advances in treatment have broadened our perspective on the diseases that patients with HIV infection develop.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had been discontinued (due to cytopenia) before the onset of T gondii pneumonia. T gondii was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by growth in fibroblast cell culture routinely used for the isolation of viruses and detected in lung on autopsy. Tissue culture used for the detection of viruses can also be diagnostically useful for the detection of T gondii.

TI  - Proliferative responses to recall antigens are associated with pregnancy outcome in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion [published erratum appears in J Clin Invest 1998 Jan 15;101(2):513]  
AB  - Maternal tolerance of the fetal hemiallograft suggests that immunomodulation occurs during gestation. Therefore, recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) may represent a failure of the immune changes that maintain pregnancy. We hypothesized that fertile women but not women with RSA may lose their immune responses to recall antigens when pregnant. This phenomenon has been seen in immunosuppressed transplant recipients and is associated with graft survival. Therefore, we evaluated proliferative responses to recall antigens in four groups of women: group 1, nonpregnant fertile women with no history of pregnancy loss and at least one prior healthy pregnancy, n = 13; group 2, nonpregnant women with a history of three or more spontaneous abortions, n = 28; group 3, healthy pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of gestation without a history of prior pregnancy loss, n = 15; and group 4, pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of gestation, with a history of RSA, n = 22. Proliferative responses of peripheral blood leukocytes to the recall antigens influenza and tetanus, alloantigens, and phytohemagglutinin were determined prospectively. Positive responses (stimulation index > 3) to recall antigens (a response to either influenza or tetanus was considered positive) were as follows: group 1 (nonpregnant fertile women), 11/13 (85%); group 2 (nonpregnant RSA women), 24/28 (86%); group 3 (pregnant fertile women), 4/15 (27%) (P &lt;/= 0.007); and group 4 (pregnant RSA women), 13/22 (59%) (P = 0.032) [corrected]. In group 4, there was 100% fetal survival in the nine women who lost responsiveness to recall antigens; however, in the 13/22 patients who responded to recall antigens, 9/13 (69%) had a repeat spontaneous abortion. These findings suggest that immunosuppression, indirectly measured by proliferation to recall antigens, is necessary for early pregnancy maintenance. Furthermore, this approach may be useful for predicting pregnancy outcome for women with RSA and may provide a useful means for designing and monitoring therapies.

We present a patient with NIDDM, subacute onset of painful asymmetric polyradiculopathy, and unilateral enhancement of lumbar nerve roots on MRI. Clinical improvement and resolution of nerve root enhancement occurred with immunosuppression. We suggest, therefore, that nerve biopsy and gadolinum-enhanced lumbosacral MRI be performed in all patients presenting with diabetic amyotrophy. If nerve root enhancement is present or if nerve biopsy shows perivascular infiltrates, we recommend a trial of immunosuppression.

TI  - Treatment of acute rejection in live related renal allograft recipients: a comparison of three different protocols.  
AB  - We present our experience on the comparison of three different modes of steroid therapy, oral prednisolone (OP), intravenous dexamethasone (IVDX) and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in the treatment of acute rejection (AR) in renal allograft recipients. Between January 1980 and January 1992, 206 patients underwent live related renal transplantation. Before 1990, all received prednisolone (PRED) and azathioprine (AZA) only. After 1990, patients were given PRED, AZA and cyclosporine (CsA). After 1 year, CsA was stopped and patients were converted to a two-drug regimen only. Of the 206 patients, 180 (87.4%) were male and mean age was 30.3+/-8.7 years (range 14-63). During the mean follow-up of 43.5 months, 178 episodes of AR were seen in 121 patients. Each episode was considered as a separate entrant in the study.  Conventional immunosuppression was given in 151 episodes and 27 episodes were on triple-drug therapy. Diagnosis of AR was made by clinical, sonography, nuclear scan with or without graft biopsy evidence. Of the 178 AR, 110 (61.8%) were within 3 months, 36 (20.2%) were between 3 months and 1 year and 32 (18%) were after 1 year. OP was given in 11 cases while IVDX and IVMP were given in 48 and 119 cases respectively. Overall, 154 (86%) showed either a complete or partial response to antirejection therapy. Response to therapy was 91, 90 and 85% in OP, IVDX and IVMP groups respectively. There was no statistical difference in response rate in different groups. There was also no difference in side effects in three different groups. Our data suggest that it is the high dose of steroid rather than mode of therapy which is responsible for therapeutic benefit in treatment of AR.

TI  - Does methotrexate increase the risk of infection or malignancy?  
AB  - Most patients do not exhibit overt signs of immunosuppression. Studies cited in this article support a modest increase in the rate of bacterial respiratory and skin infections. Opportunistic infections occur rarely, however, and may be life threatening. The case for MTX carcinogenicity is less clear. The risk for malignancy other than lymphoproliferative disorders does not seem to be elevated, although multiple sporadic malignancies have been reported in treated patients. MTX is a superb agent for the therapy of a large group of immune-mediated diseases. Although an increased risk for infection and possible malignancy exists, the risk is small compared with the potential clinical benefit.

TI  - Solitary pancreas transplantation for nonuremic patients with labile insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation has become a widely accepted treatment option for selected uremic patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Patient survival rates at 1 year exceed 90%, and rates of pancreas graft survival, 70%. However, solitary pancreas transplantation for nonuremic patients with IDDM has been controversial because of the less favorable outcome and the need for long-term immunosuppression with its associated morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We studied the outcome of 225 solitary pancreas transplants during three immunosuppressive eras: the precyclosporine (CsA) era (n=83), the CsA era (n=118), and the tacrolimus era (n=24). Only patients with labile IDDM (e.g., hypoglycemic unawareness, insulin reactions, > or = 2 failed attempts at intensified insulin therapy for metabolic control) underwent solitary pancreas transplantation. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we looked at patient and graft survival, the risk of surgical complications, and native kidney function during these three eras. RESULTS: Pancreas graft survival improved significantly over time: 34% at 1 year after transplantation in the pre-CsA era, 52% in the CsA era, and 80% in the tacrolimus era (P=0.002). Pancreas graft loss due to rejection decreased from 50% at 1 year in the pre-CsA era, to 34% in the CsA era, to 9% in the tacrolimus era (P=0.008). The rate of technical failures (i.e., the risk of surgical complications) decreased from 30% in the pre-CsA era, to 14% in the CsA era, to 0% in the tacrolimus era (P=0.001). Patient survival rates at 1 year have ranged between 88% and 95% in the three eras (P=NS). Matching for at least one antigen on each HLA locus and avoiding HLA-B mismatches significantly decreased the incidence of rejection. The incidence of native kidney failure due to drug-induced toxicity decreased significantly over time, in part because only recipients with pretransplant creatinine clearance > or = 80 ml/min received transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Solitary pancreas transplantation has become a viable alternative for nonuremic patients with labile IDDM. The risks of surgical complications and drug-induced nephrotoxicity have significantly decreased over time. Using tacrolimus as the mainstay immunosuppressant, patient and graft survival rates now no longer trail those of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation.

TI  - Inhibition of xanthine oxidase does not influence immunosuppression after hemorrhagic shock.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resuscitated hemorrhagic shock causes global ischemia reperfusion with generation of toxic oxygen metabolites. We hypothesized that the immunosuppression that follows hemorrhagic shock may be linked to this process. METHODS: Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 250-300 g) were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg for 60 minutes, then were resuscitated with three times the maximum blood loss of lactated Ringer's solution. Immune response was assessed by splenocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production 72 hours after hemorrhage. Allopurinol (50 mg/kg) was given after hemorrhage and immediately before resuscitation. RESULTS: Hemorrhagic shock caused significant decreases in splenocyte proliferation (cpm: (157,880 +/- 22,068 (mean +/- SD) vs. 37,787 +/- 15,849) and IL-2 production (1/2 max U/ml: 79.6 +/- 7.9 vs. 48.0 +/- 7.7) (both p < 0.05). Hepatic xanthine oxidase was significantly increased with hemorrhage and resuscitation. Hepatic xanthine oxidase activity after hemorrhage and resuscitation was significantly decreased after treatment with allopurinol (74.2 +/- 41.7 vs. 9.2 +/- 9.40). Allopurinol did not affect splenocyte proliferation (cpm: 21,875 +/- 9,316) or IL-2 production (1/2 max U/ml: 45.0 +/- 7.1). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that inhibition of xanthine oxidase by allopurinol after hemorrhagic shock did not affect splenocyte proliferation or IL-2 production. We conclude that the immunosuppression after hemorrhagic shock is not dependent on xanthine oxidase-induced production of toxic oxygen metabolites.

TI  - A novel approach to the treatment of chronic allograft nephropathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive deterioration of renal function in kidney transplant recipients is the leading cause of graft failure. Both nonimmunologic and immunologic mechanisms contribute to this deterioration. METHODS: Twenty-eight cyclosporine (CsA)-treated renal transplant recipients (21 cadaveric, 5 living, 2 simultaneous kidney-pancreas) with progressive deterioration of renal function were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial and had their immunosuppressive regimen changed 24.3+/-7.7 months after transplant. All patients had their CsA dose reduced by 50%, azathioprine was discontinued, and mycophenolate mofetil was added to the medical regimen. The mean creatinine of the patients at the initiation of the change in immunosuppression was 3.5+/-1.2 mg/dl (range 1.9 to 6.2 mg/dl). RESULTS: Before the change in immunosuppression, the mean loss in renal function as indicated by the least-squares slope of the reciprocal of creatinine versus time was -0.006+/-0.002 (mg/dl)-1 per month. The change in immunosuppression significantly decreased the rate of loss in renal function for most patients when compared with their pretreatment values with a mean slope of 0.007+/-0.003 (mg/dl)-1 per month (P=0.003). Renal function improved in 21 of 28 patients. Only one patient had continued deterioration of renal function. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for CsA dose, mean arterial blood pressure, and baseline creatinine, the change in immunosuppression was significantly associated with improved renal function (P=0.02). There were no acute rejections after the immunosuppression change. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adding mycophenolate mofetil and reducing CsA in patients with chronic deterioration of graft function is well tolerated and results in a short-term improvement in renal function.

TI  - [Intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation in ovarian cancers: analysis of 67 patients treated at the Paoli-Calmettes Institute and a review of the literature]  
AB  - Despite important initial chemosensitivity, advanced ovarian cancer has a bad prognosis with a median survival of 20 to 30 months. These results might be better with intensive chemotherapy. We analysed 67 patients treated by intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for advanced ovarian cancer at Institute Paoli-Calmettes between 1980 and 1994. Population was divided in two groups: salvage group (n = 30) for initial chemotherapy-refractory patients and consolidation group (n = 37) for sensitive patients. Several successive conditioning regimens were used, all based on alkylating agents. Principal toxicities were severe aplasia and mucositis. Four patients died from toxicity related to infection during strong immunosuppression. In salvage group, 9 out of 21 evaluable patients responded (43%), but duration of responses was short (median range of 5 months) and 2-year overall survival rate was 8% after transplantation. In consolidation group, 19 patients are alive and 15 are without disease progression with a median follow-up of 42 months (17, 161) after diagnosis. Five-year disease-free survival rate is 28% (median range of 35 months) and 5-year overall survival rate is 48% (median range of 41 months). Intensification does not seem to be long term beneficial for initial chemotherapy refractory patients, despite objective responses rate better than classical treatment. On the other hand, results seem better than conventional treatments in case of chemosensitive disease and should be confirmed prospectively in larger cohort of patients. Moreover, other research directions are open like intensification supported by hematopoietic growth-factors and peripheral stem cells, definition of best conditioning regimen, use of taxanes, and intensification in first line chemotherapy after initial surgery.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring of blood supply to knee joint transplants in dogs.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transplantation of vascularized knee joints has become technically feasible, but graft rejection as well as failures of the vascular anastomoses remain critical hazards. We therefore tested the potential of repetitive non-invasive duplex sonography to detect changes of the arterial blood flow following canine knee joint transplantation. METHODS: Four transplantations and, as controls, 4 replantations of intact canine knee joints were performed. The follow-up was 6 months. During this period, repetitive duplex sonography measurements as well as tests of knee joint function were performed. Six months postoperatively, angiographies were performed and all joints were explanted for histological investigation. RESULTS: The luminal diameters of the implanted popliteal artery remained constant in the transplanted animals (preop. 2.6 +/- 0.2 mm, 6 months postop. 2.7 +/- 0.2 mm) but decreased in the autografted controls (preop. 2.9 +/- 0.3 mm, postop. 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm). The time-averaged velocity of the popliteal artery blood flow decreased in both groups 1 month postoperatively. Subsequently, blood flow velocity recovered in transplanted animals but remained low in replanted controls. Significant arterial wall thickening was also detected in transplanted animals as compared to controls. Six months postoperatively, hypervascularization of transplanted joints was confirmed by angiography and thickening of the arterial wall by histology. Furthermore, histology identified mild to chronic allograft rejection in all transplanted joints in spite of controlled cyclosporin A trough level immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic rejection of transplanted vascularized knee joints appears to be associated with vessel wall thickening and hypervascularization rather than with vascular rarefaction (picture of the 'arbre mort') that is characteristic of the rejection of most parenchymatous organs. Duplex sonography appears to be sensitive in detecting the corresponding changes of blood supply.

TI  - Proliferative response of human T lymphocytes to porcine fetal brain cells.  
AB  - Intracerebral grafting of porcine fetal brain cells is a potential treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Although it is well known that the survival of fetal pig brain cells in the rat brain requires immunosuppression, the response of human T lymphocytes to fetal pig brain cells is unknown. Here we report on the proliferative response of human T lymphocytes to freshly isolated cells and 14-18 days cultured cells from 28- or 35-day-old porcine fetal brains. After 5 days of mixed lymphocyte-brain cell culture, we observed no or only minor T cell responses to the freshly isolated brain cells, while both CD4 cells and CD8 cells proliferated in response to the cultured brain cells. Pretreatment of the cultured brain cells with heat-inactivated human serum significantly reduced the proliferative T cell response. The data suggest that the porcine fetal brain contains cells that can stimulate the human cellular immune system, and that this stimulation may be reduced by pretreatment of the fetal pig brain cells with human serum.

TI  - Modulation of immune response by blood transfusion: evidence for a differential effect of allogeneic and autologous blood in colorectal cancer surgery.  
AB  - Even though blood transfusion-associated immunomodulatory effects have been reported, the basic immune mechanism is still not understood. Data from studies on the clinical effects of allogeneic blood-induced immunosuppression are contradictory. However, there are indications that autologous blood transfusion is not immunologically neutral but has intrinsic immunomodulatory potential. Therefore we investigated in vivo different immunological mediators in 56 randomized patients of a study comparing autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion in colorectal cancer surgery. Soluble IL-2 receptor, which is an indicator of general immune activation and the following immunologic refractory phase, indicated immunosuppression was more elevated at the seventh postoperative day in patients with allogeneic transfusions (p = .013) and autologous transfusions (p = .0003). The immunologic determination of TNF-alpha showed a significant postoperative increase in patients with autologous transfusions only (p = .0031). However, postoperative increase of soluble TNF-receptors p55 and p75 was also significant in patients transfused with allogenic blood (p = .022; p = .0014). The response to tetanus toxoid vaccination, an indicator of humoral immunity, was higher in patients transfused with allogeneic rather than autologous blood (p = .082), whereas responses of patients with autologous transfusions were even lower than in nontransfused patients. The reciprocal was already found for cell-mediated immunity determined by epicutaneously tested delayed-type hypersensitivity-reactions. IL-10 levels, an indicator of cellular immunosuppression, were determined in 27 additional patients before operation, immediately postoperative, and at the seventh postoperative day. IL-10 was found elevated immediately postoperative in allogeneic (p = .011) and nontransfused patients only (p = .042). The data from this study substantiate recent findings of a different immunomodulatory potential of allogeneic and autologous blood transfusion. They furthermore support the hypothesis that autologous blood transfusion does not contain immunologically neutral effects of allogeneic blood, but itself exerts an immunomodulatory effect.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus: biology and disease.  
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus is a human herpes virus which, whilst found as a widespread asymptomatic infection, is also associated with certain tumours of lymphoid and epithelial origin including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), immunoblastic lymphoma (IBL), Hodgkin's Disease (HD) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A unique characteristic of EBV is its ability to infect and transform primary resting B lymphocytes in vitro into permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); this effect is associated with constitutive expression of a limited set of viral genes. Interestingly, the pattern of EBV gene expression observed in LCLs in vitro is also a feature of IBLs, a tumour associated with immunosuppression. The other EBV associated tumours display a more restricted pattern of EBV latent protein expression. B cell lines can be activated in vitro into the virus replicative cycle, where a large number of viral genes associated with EBV DNA replication and virus assembly are synthesised. Whilst EBV can be detected in throat washings from seropositive individuals, the only in vivo situation where full virus replication can be reliably observed in hairy leukoplakia (HL), a benign lesion of lingual epithelium frequently found in AIDS patients. Thus, the relative contribution of lymphoid cells and epithelial cells to latent EBV infection/persistence vs replication in vivo remains controversial. Recent studies suggest that HL represents a focus of EBV replication in the absence of a truly latent infection and this supports the contention that EBV persistence resides in the lymphoid compartment. These aspects together with the role of EBV in oral diseases and the effect of certain EBV genes on the control of epithelial cell growth and differentiation will be discussed.

TI  - Activation of bovine lymphocyte subpopulations by staphylococcal enterotoxin C.  
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major mastitis-causing pathogen in cattle. The chronic nature of bovine staphylococcal mastitis suggests that some products or components of S. aureus may interfere with the development of protective immunity. One class of molecules that could be involved are superantigens (SAgs). Although a significant number of mastitis isolates produce SAgs, the effect of these molecules on the bovine immune system is unresolved. To determine if immunosuppression caused by SAgs could play a role in pathogenesis, we monitored bovine lymphocytes exposed to staphylococcal enterotoxin C1 (SEC1). Activation of bovine lymphocytes by either SEC1 or concanavalin A (ConA) was influenced by the gammadelta/alphabeta T-cell ratio in the culture. Compared to ConA-induced stimulation, cultures stimulated with SEC1 generated small numbers of CD4+ alphabeta T cells expressing high levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), suggesting that SAg exposure does not lead to full activation of these cells. This state of partial activation was most pronounced in cultures with a high gammadelta/alphabeta ratio. In contrast, significant numbers of CD8+ alphabeta T cells expressed high levels of IL-2R alpha and MHCII, regardless of the gammadelta/alphabeta ratio and the stimulant used. CD8+ blasts in cultures stimulated with SEC1 also expressed another activation marker, ACT3, previously detected predominantly on thymocytes and CD4+ T cells. Although gammadelta CD2- and CD2+ T cells expressed MHCII and IL-2R alpha following stimulation with SEC1, only a few cells increased to blast size, suggesting that they were only partially activated. The results suggest ways in which SAgs might facilitate immunosuppression that promotes the persistence of bacteria in cattle and contributes to chronic intramammary infection.

TI  - Prevention of photoimmunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis by topical nicotinamide.  
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) B irradiation leads to a potent immunosuppression of the capacity to reject syngeneic, antigenic tumors. If this immunosuppression is critical for the development of most skin tumors, then its prevention should result in prevention of photocarcinogenesis. We previously showed a correlation between the inhibition of photoimmunosuppression and prevention of photocarcinogenesis by dl-alpha-tocopherol, tannic acid, or alpha-difluoromethylornithine. The current study was designed to determine whether topical nicotinamide, the active form of vitamin B-3, or niacin, prevents immunosuppression and skin cancer in UV-irradiated mice. In a passive transfer assay for immunosuppression, splenocytes from UV-irradiated mice enhanced the growth of antigenic tumor challenges in recipient mice. Treatment of the UV-irradiated mice with 40 mumol of nicotinamide twice weekly starting two weeks before UV irradiation and throughout the experiment prevented this immunosuppression. UVB irradiation consisted of five weekly 30-minute exposures to banks of six FS40 Westinghouse fluorescent sunlamps. Mice received approximately 6.2 x 10(5) J/m2 in the passive transfer assays and 1.09 x 10(6) J/m2 in the photocarcinogenesis studies. Application of nicotinamide to UV-irradiated mice reduced skin tumor incidence from 75% to 42.5% (p = 0.016, Cox proportional hazards analysis). Thus topical nicotinamide prevented the immunosuppression and skin tumor induction by UVB irradiation.

TI  - A tacrolimus-related immunosuppressant with reduced toxicity.  
AB  - BACKGROUND. Tacrolimus (FK506) has potent immunosuppressive properties reflecting its ability to block the transcription of lymphokine genes in activated T cells through formation of a complex with FK506 binding protein-12, which inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. The clinical usefulness of tacrolimus is limited, however, by severe adverse effects, including neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Although this toxicity, like immunosuppression, appears mechanistically related to the calcineurin inhibitory action of the drug, a large chemistry effort has been devoted to search for tacrolimus analogs with reduced toxicity but preserved immunosuppressive activity that might have enhanced therapeutic utility. METHODS. Here, we report on the identification of such an analog, which was synthetically derived from ascomycin (ASC), the C21 ethyl analog of tacrolimus, by introducing an indole group at the C32 position. The profile of biological activity of indolyl-ASC was characterized in rodent models of immunosuppression and toxicity. RESULTS. Indolyl-ASC was found to exhibit an immunosuppressive potency equivalent to that of tacrolimus in T-cell activation in vitro and in murine transplant models, even though indolyl-ASC bound about 10 times less to intracellular FK506 binding protein-12 than tacrolimus or ASC. Further evaluation of indolyl-ASC revealed that it is threefold less potent than tacrolimus in inducing hypothermia, a response that may reflect neurotoxicity, and in causing gastrointestinal transit alterations in mice. Moreover, indolyl-ASC was at least twofold less nephrotoxic than tacrolimus upon 3-week oral treatment in rats. CONCLUSIONS. Altogether, these data indicate a modest but definite improvement in the therapeutic index for indolyl-ASC compared with tacrolimus in rodent models.

TI  - Primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for renal allograft recipients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies using tacrolimus and corticosteroids or the combination of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes in cadaveric kidney recipients compared with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. The current study is a retrospective analysis of our experience with tacrolimus combined with mycophenolate mofetil and steroids as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, 72 patients who received primary therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids (triple therapy) were compared with a control group of 98 kidney recipients who received tacrolimus and corticosteroids (double therapy). RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection in the triple therapy group (8.2%) compared with the double therapy group (21%; P=0.003). One-year patient and graft survival did not differ between groups. The incidence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 18% and 21% in the triple and double therapy groups, respectively. Leukopenia and gastrointestinal side effects were the most common cause for discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids is more effective at preventing early acute rejection than tacrolimus and corticosteroids alone. The use of mycophenolate mofetil was associated with a higher incidence of leukopenia and diarrhea, often leading to discontinuation of the drug.

TI  - Augmentation of natural killer cell activity induced by cytomegalovirus infection in mice treated with FK506.  
AB  - Comparable rates of patient and graft survival after FK506 and cyclosporine treatments have been reported in the prevention of liver allograft rejection. On this basis, we examined the effect of FK506 on pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in mice. FK506 induced apparent immunosuppression in mice which could be monitored by the level of antibody production. The effective dose of trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH) for 50% reduction in antibody production was 0.9 mg/kg. Even in such an immunosuppressed status at this or higher dose of FK506, CMV infection was relatively alleviated, which was observed by the frequency of virus isolation and the mean virus titer of the lungs of mice treated with 0.1-1 mg/kg FK506 in comparison to untreated mice. The dose of FK506 attaining 50% frequency of lung infection was 1.5 mg/kg. The activity of natural killer (NK) cells was enhanced in infected mice. This enhancement was stronger in infected mice treated with FK506 at 0.32 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg than in untreated infected mice on day 3 post infection (p.i.). Thus, an immunosuppressant FK506 augmented inducible NK cell activity and alleviated MCMV infection even under immunosuppression.

TI  - Predictors and outcome of early- versus late-onset major bacterial infections in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus (FK506) as primary immunosuppression.  
AB  - Major bacterial infections and the predictors of early (within 100 days of transplantation) versus late onset (after 100 days post-transplant) bacterial infections were prospectively assessed in 130 consecutive liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus (FK506) as primary immunosuppression. The median follow-up period was 38 months. Overall, 35% (45/130) of the patients developed 67 episodes of major bacterial infections (0.52 episodes/patient). Sixty-three percent of the major bacterial infections occurred early, and 37% occurred in the late post-transplant period. Eighty-four percent of the abdominal infections occurred early, whereas 38% of the cases of pneumonia, 60% of the cases of primary bacteremia, and 50% of the biliary infections occurred late. By logistic regression analysis, portal vein thrombosis was the most significant independent risk factor for early-onset major bacterial infection (odds ratio 4.1; 95% CI 1.4-12.2), and recurrent hepatitis C was the most significant independent predictor of late-onset major bacterial infections (odds ratio 6.21; 95% CI 1.9-20.2). Thus, sources and risk factors differ for early versus late-onset bacterial infections after liver transplantation. Knowledge of the differences in the potential sources, the pathogens, and the predictors of early versus late-onset bacterial infections can be valuable in the evaluation and empiric treatment of liver transplant recipients with bacterial infections.

Our complex examination of the dogs included the following: leukocyte count, differential count, phagocytosis, blastogenic lymphocyte transformation and quantitation of total serum immunoglobulins, lysozyme and haemolytic complement. Immunosuppression was found in 19 (28.8%) cases. Immunosuppression was rare in dogs with demodicosis and did not appear without a concurrent pyoderma. An increase in the neutrophil counts and total serum immunoglobulin levels significant was found in dogs with demodicosis combined with pyoderma. On the contrary, marked immunosuppression was detected in dogs with deep pyoderma. A considerable immunosuppression was present in 7 of 10 German shepherds dog pyoderma (GSP). Significant depressions were found in phagocyte activity and lymphocyte activity. Immunosuppression was observed in 4 of 9 dogs in other breeds with uncomplicated deep pyoderma. All groups of dogs with pyoderma showed a significant increase in total serum immunoglobulins. Conclusion from these findings is that deep pyoderma more than Demodicosis was concerned with immunosuppression. German shepherds with deep pyoderma had more expressed immunosuppression than other breeds.

TI  - Characterization of the immune response after local delivery of recombinant adenovirus in murine pancreas and successful strategies for readministration.  
AB  - The pancreas is an ideal organ for adenoviral gene therapy because of the high level of gene transfer that can be achieved and because of the many diseases that can potentially be treated using this technology. In this report, we characterize the immune response to direct pancreatic injection of adenovirus and we overcome some of the limitations it imposes by using immunosuppression. Direct injection of recombinant adenovirus into the pancreas leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies and to sensitized splenocytes which engage in increased cytotoxic, lymphoproliferative, and cytokine release activity when reexposed to adenovirus. Transgene expression is transient and the vector cannot be readministered. Deletion of CD4+ T helper cells improves expression over time (40% of pancreatic cells express transgene at day 28 vs. 5% in controls), and allows the vector to be readministered in the pancreas, albeit, inefficiently, when compared to naive animals. Similarly, blockade of CD40 ligand, which preserves the CD4+ T helper cell population, also improves expression over time (30% of pancreatic cells express transgene at day 28), and allows the vector to be readministered. With both approaches, neutralizing antibodies are decreased and the remaining splenocytes do not engage in activated immune responses. Thus, local delivery of the adenoviral vector induces a systemic response that prevents pancreatic readministration, even with direct injection. Blockade of CD40 ligand and T helper cell depletion are transient regimens that induce systemic immunosuppression. Until the development of newer strategies that selectively suppress adenoviral immune responses, these are viable alternatives for enhancement of pancreatic adenoviral delivery.

TI  - Combined radiotherapy and medical immunosuppression in the management of thyroid eye disease [see comments]  
AB  - Although systemic steroids or orbital radiotherapy are effective in limiting the inflammatory response in thyroid eye disease (TED), there are reports of over 70% of treated patients requiring subsequent rehabilitative surgery: either orbital decompression or strabismus correction. This study investigated whether combined immunosuppression with primary orbital radiotherapy together with azathioprine and low-dose prednisolone, applied early in the active disease state, was more effective in treating TED. Forty consecutive patients with active TED were recruited. Orbital MRI (STIR sequence) was used to assess disease activity. Median duration of symptoms was 1.0 year. Subjects were treated with bilateral orbital radiotherapy (20 Gy in 10 fractions) and oral prednisolone and azathioprine. Pre- and post-treatment activity was measured clinically, including uniocular field of fixation, Mourits score and total eye score, until TED became inactive off all treatment. Before treatment, 15 subjects had signs of dysthyroid optic neuropathy, 35 had significant motility restriction and 38 had marked soft tissue signs. On average TED became inactive after 1.2 years (SD 0.7) of immunosuppression, and treatment was well tolerated. One patient required subsequent cosmetic orbital decompression, 6 had successful strabismus surgery and 13 required minor cosmetic lid surgery. Compared with previously reported treatment regimes we think that combined orbital radiotherapy and medical immunosuppression is far more effective than either treatment alone in the management of active TED, and led to fewer side effects of high-dose steroids. In particular there was more than a four-fold reduction in the requirement for orbital decompression and strabismus surgery.

TI  - The use of endogenous antioxidants to improve photoprotection.  
AB  - The skin possesses an elaborate antioxidant defence system to deal with UV-induced oxidative stress. However, excessive exposure to UV can overwhelm the cutaneous antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative damage and ultimately to skin cancer, immunosuppression and premature skin aging. Therefore, an interesting strategy for photoprotection is the support of the endogenous antioxidant system. This can be accomplished by induction or transdermal delivery of the various antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, or superoxide dismutase. Supplementation of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate and beta-carotene was also found to be very effective in photoprotection. Although treatments with single components of the antioxidant system were successful against a wide variety of photodamage, the balance between the different antioxidants in the skin is very important. In some studies, it was found that too much of a single component could even have deleterious effects. The most promising results were obtained in studies combining several compounds, often resulting in synergism of the protective effects.

TI  - Autoimmune disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia.  
AB  - Immune dysregulation, a hallmark of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), manifests itself in three autoimmune diseases: warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA); idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP); and, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). AIHA occurs in 11% of advanced stage CLL patients. Prednisone is the first treatment of choice, with 90% responses and 65% complete responses. More than 60% of patients relapse when treatment is stopped. Intravenous immunoglobulin, the next line of treatment, causes responses in 40% of patients. While the data are very limited, cyclosporine A is a reasonable choice for third-line therapy. Alkylating agents, danazol, plasma exchange, immunoabsorption, vincristine-loaded platelets, splenectomy, and splenic irradiation are also reported to cause responses. The data on mechanisms of AIHA are most consistent with immune dysregulation leading to loss of tolerance to a self antigen which in turn leads to the immune-based hemolytic anemia. PRCA is underrecognized in CLL with 6% of CLL patients having PRCA when tested for it. Unlike AIHA, PRCA often occurs in early stage disease. Anemia, reticulocytopenia, and a marrow virtually devoid of red blood cell precursors are hallmarks of PRCA. Corticosteroid therapy is the first line of treatment. If a response is not obtained in 4 weeks, cyclosporine A should be added. Although the data on pathophysiology are very limited, PRCA appears to be the result of an abnormal T cell that both fails in its normal function to support growth and inhibits the growth of erythroid progenitor cells. ITP occurs in 2-3% of CLL patients, occurs in early stage disease and may be a presenting manifestation. Initial therapy for ITP mirrors the guidelines for primary ITP. Initial therapy should consist of prednisone. Seventy percent of patients respond. Splenectomy is a reasonable second-line treatment. Autoimmune phenomena, largely related to blood cells, are based in the immune dysregulation of CLL. Longer survivals in CLL patients, more treatment regimens per patient, and more immunosuppression with modern treatments, allow us to predict an increasing incidence of autoimmune blood cell diseases in CLL.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta and immunosuppression in experimental visceral leishmaniasis.  
AB  - Hamsters infected with Leishmania donovani develop a disease similar to human kala-azar. They present hypergammaglobulinemia, and their T cells do not respond to parasite antigens. This unresponsiveness has been primarily ascribed to defects in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), because these cells are unable to stimulate proliferation of parasite-specific T cells from immunized animals. In this study, we show that APCs (adherent spleen cells) from L. donovani-infected hamsters produce high levels of the inhibitory cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Immunohistochemical studies with an anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody (MAb) showed that this cytokine is abundantly produced in vivo by the spleen cells of infected animals. In addition, high levels of TGF-beta are produced in vitro by infected hamster cells, either spontaneously or after stimulation with parasite antigen or lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, in vivo-infected adherent cells obtained from spleens of L. donovani-infected hamsters caused profound inhibition of the in vitro antigen-induced proliferative response of lymph node cells from hamsters immunized with leishmanial antigens. Moreover, this inhibition was totally abrogated by the anti-TGF-beta MAb. These results suggest that the immunosuppression observed in visceral leishmaniasis is, at least in part, due to the abundant production of TGF-beta during the course of the infection.

TI  - Metoclopramide: a novel and safe immunomodulating agent for restoring the depressed macrophage immune function after hemorrhage.  
AB  - BACKGROUND and OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that administration of the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin, after hemorrhage restored the depressed immune responses that are observed under those conditions. Because metoclopramide (MCP) is known to increase prolactin secretion and ultimately plasma prolactin levels, we attempted to determine whether administration of metoclopramide after hemorrhage produces any beneficial effects on the depressed splenocyte and peritoneal macrophage immune function after severe hemorrhage. DESIGN, MATERIALS and METHODS: Mice were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 35 mm Hg for 60 minutes, then adequately resuscitated and segregated into two groups. One group received saline vehicle; animals in the other group were treated with metoclopramide (100 microg/100 g body weight, subcutaneously) before resuscitation. Two hours after saline or MCP injection, the animals were killed and macrophage as well as splenocyte cultures established. Plasma corticosterone levels were also measured. RESULTS: The proliferative capacity of the splenocytes as well as their ability to release interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-3 in response to mitogen was markedly improved in animals that had hemorrhaged and that were treated with MCP compared with saline-injected mice. Moreover, the depressed splenic and peritoneal macrophage IL-1 and IL-6 release after hemorrhage was restored with MCP treatment. Furthermore, treatment with MCP prevented the increase in blood corticosterone levels seen after severe hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: These results support the concept that the immunosuppression after hemorrhage may be mediated by hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, MCP may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of the trauma-hemorrhagic shock-induced immunosuppression.

TI  - Time-dependent expression of donor- and host-specific major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens in allogeneic dopamine-rich macro- and micrografts: comparison of two different grafting protocols.  
AB  - Neural transplantation, as a therapeutic approach to Parkinson's disease, still requires allogeneic graft material and raises questions of immunosuppression and graft rejection. The present study investigated the time course of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression and astrocytic response in allogeneic dopaminergic grafts, comparing two different grafting protocols. Adult 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned Lewis 1.W rats received intrastriatal cell suspension grafts from the ventral mesencephalon of DA rat fetuses, either as single 1-microliter macrograft via metal cannula or as four micrografts of 250 nl/deposit via a glass capillary. No immunosuppression was administered. Immunohistochemistry was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks after grafting, using antibodies against donor- and host-specific MHC class I and II antigen, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Most animals showed good allograft survival up to 12 weeks after transplantation with no signs of rejection. Reinnervation of the lesioned striatum by TH-positive neurites was observed from 3-6 weeks on. Expression of donor-specific MHC class I was comparably low in both allogeneic grafting groups, while host MHC class I and II reaction as well as astrocytic response tended to be higher in the macrografted animals. Donor MHC class II was not observed at any time point. It is concluded that intraparenchymal allografts of fetal mesencephalic cell suspensions can survive well in the rat Parkinson model without immunosuppression for at least 12 weeks, and that the expression of moderate amounts of donor-specific MHC class I antigen does not suffice to initiate a rejection process. In addition, the microtransplantation approach may reduce the level of trauma and subsequent MHC and GFAP expression and may, thereby, minimize the risk of graft rejection.

TI  - Review article: Local and systemic regulation of mucosal immunity.  
AB  - An increased interest in mucosal immunity has stemmed from the identification of novel T-cell populations and developments in oral vaccines and oral tolerance. The development of physiological inflammation is antigen driven. Upon recognition of antigen, the lamina propria (LP) is populated with lymphocytes and activated peripheral cells acquire the capacity to home to the gut. Antigen entry to the gut is via follicle-associated epithelium or M cells. The antigen now interacts with macrophages or CD4+ cells, and go on to the Peyer's patch where B cells undergo a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-mediated isotope switch to immunoglobulin (Ig) A. TGF-beta may also play a role in the development of oral tolerance. The intestinal epithelium is seen as the site for the activation of CD8+ suppressor cells. Controlled inflammation is therefore explained by the interaction of LP lymphocytes and intra-epithelial cells (IEC). IECs are capable of extending processes that express regulatory surface molecules coupled with antigen processed from luminal uptake. CD8+ T-cell activation is favoured over CD4+ T-cell activation due to the size of the antigenic binding peptide. The result is suppressed inflammation. Other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells may also contribute to local immunosuppression.

TI  - [Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an uncommon agent of infective arthritis. In this report three cases of pneumococcal arthritis are described. METHODS: Retrospective review of synovial fluids processed in our laboratory yielding bacteria. The study period was from January 1991 to December 1995. The clinical records of patients with the clinical and microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight out of a total of 43 clinical records had the clinical and microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis and three (11%) were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The infective source in two of these three cases was probably the respiratory tract, and the most common location was the knee. CONCLUSIONS: In our cases immunosuppression seemed to be the major risk factor involved in the development of pneumococcal arthritis.

TI  - Immunosuppression during spaceflight deconditioning.  
AB  - Spaceflight results in immunosuppression which is likely due mainly to neurohumoral factors released in response to intermittent stress effects during flight. However, no major non-physiological health problems have been reported during or following spaceflight, but diseases resulting from immunosuppression could occur on long-duration missions and would include bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in addition to increased incidence of neoplasia and autoimmunity. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics appear to be altered during spaceflight and, as a consequence, alternative drug administration and dosing procedures will need to be developed. Moderate exercise training enhances immune function, but in-flight exercise may affect immunological parameters and immunity in ways not yet ascertained. Hyperosmolality may enhance some immune parameters, and attenuate others especially when associated with dehydration and exercise. Reducing in-flight stress may attenuate flight-induced immunosuppression, but pharmacological interventions may be essential to prevent undesirable immune responses which may occur on long-duration missions to Mars.

TI  - Mycoses of the urogenital tract.  
AB  - Mycotic infections of the urogenital tract are rarely caused by primary fungal pathogens, often however, by opportunistic fungi such as Candida species. Opportunistic fungi infect the urogenital tract either by haematogenous spread from a distant site, or a break of tissue integrity, or by retrograde ascension from the perianal region, or by wound contamination. After an initial polymorphonuclear reaction macrophages may invade giving rise to a granulomatous response. Risk factors for mycotic urogenital infections are extremes of age, long lasting and broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, malignancy, x-ray therapy, contaminated i.-v. catheters, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, surgery, obstructive uropathy and indwelling urethral catheters.

TI  - Cancer dissemination during laparoscopic surgery: tubes, gas, and cells.  
AB  - Port-site metastasis has been an unexpected finding after laparoscopic surgery in gastrointestinal cancer patients. No clear explanation exists for this phenomenom. The aims of this study were to evaluate the dissemination pattern in an experimental model of hepatocarcinoma in the rat and summarize current knowledge about the risks and the results of experimental studies on cancer dissemination during laparoscopic surgery. NDA-induced hepatocarcinoma was obtained in Sprague-Dawley rats. Tumors were manipulated during laparoscopy (group 1, n = 11) or laparotomy (group 2, n = 12). A Medline review of all experimental studies about the risk of cancer dissemination during laparoscopic surgery was undertaken. Both models were associated with implants in parietal wounds [1/11 in group 1 (9%) vs. 1/12 in group 2 (8%), p = NS]. Analysis of the current literature confirms that laparoscopy is associated with abdominal cell mobilization, and cells can be recovered in trocars, filtered exhaust gas, and instruments.  Postoperative immunosuppression, the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor, and the gas used for laparoscopy also influence tumoral growth. Port-site metastases are secondary to multiple factors, including the technical skill of the surgeon, the biologic properties of the tumors, and local environmental aspects. Undoubtedly, laparoscopy can help disseminate aggressive tumors and should be reserved for diagnostic and staging procedures or for treatment of low-grade malignant tumors. Therapeutic resection, especially of colon cancer, should be restricted to prospective and randomized trials until there are enough hard data to rule out the clinical importance of this potentially severe complication.

TI  - Fatal leukoencephalopathy in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with CHOP chemotherapy and high-dose steroids.  
AB  - Leukoencephalopathy syndromes encompass a variety of neurologic abnormalities that affect cerebral white matter. Known etiologies include malignant hypertension, eclampsia, renal failure, CNS infection, and drug therapy with cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK506) and interferon-alpha. Symptoms vary according to sites of involvement; they include altered mentation, visual disturbances, focal neurologic signs, and seizures. Characteristic radiologic findings are hypodense areas without contrast enhancement on CT and an increased T2 signal on MRI. The hypodense areas are often symmetric. The clinical symptoms and neuroimaging abnormalities are often reversible with treatment of the underlying condition or removal of the offending drug. We describe a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with conventional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy and high-dose steroids who developed a rapidly progressive fatal leukoencephalopathy. Her neurologic symptoms and findings on CT are consistent with reported cases of leukoencephalopathy; however, in this instance, the syndrome was not reversible and was ultimately fatal. None of the previously described etiologies could be demonstrated in association with the patient's illness. There are no prior reports of fatal leukoencephalopathy in adult patients treated with standard-dose CHOP. We believe the concurrent immunosuppression from chemotherapy and high-dose steroids resulted in this patient's fatal complication.

TI  - Hospitalization rates of tuberculosis in U.S. Navy enlisted personnel: a 15-year perspective.  
AB  - The epidemiology of tuberculosis in this country is changing because of a combination of biological and social factors. The recent use of DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis has suggested that nearly one-third of new cases of tuberculosis being reported in a large metropolitan city is a result of recent infection.  The immunosuppression of individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus and the prevalence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis has resulted in a renewed interest in the epidemiology and prevention of this disease. To determine the magnitude of the problem in the U.S. Navy enlisted population, a computer search of more than one million inpatient hospitalization records from January 1980 to December 1994 was performed. Total first hospitalization rates for all cases of tuberculosis during this period ranged from 2.2 per 100,000 person-years at risk in white females to 27.5 per 100,000 person-years in males, race "other" (includes mostly Filipinos and Asian-Americans). First hospitalization rates across all cases of tuberculosis declined during this period from a high of 8.7 per 100,000 in 1980 to a low of 2.2 per 100,000 in 1994.

TI  - Cellular mechanisms of cold stress-related immunosuppression and the action of interleukin 1.  
AB  - Recent studies of the immunomodulatory cytokines, especially interleukin 1 (IL-1), as the mediators of immunoneuroendocrine links have suggested their important physiological role in the development of host resistance during stress reaction. The present study examined the effects of cold stress (-20 degrees C, 20 min) in rats on the value of humoral immune response, lymphocyte activating factor (LAF) production by peritoneal macrophages, as well as IL-1 beta action on lymphocyte proliferation, and the level of general antibody titers. Cold stress exposure led to a considerable elevation of corticosterone (Cs) in rat blood serum and to pronounced suppression of humoral immune response. This kind of experimental stress induced peritoneal macrophages in rats to release LAF without additional stimulation within 24 h after termination of cooling. At the same time LAF production by macrophages after their additional stimulation by LPS in vivo and heat-killed staphylococcus in vitro was decreased during cold stress reaction. Cold stress exposure suppressed the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to proliferate in response to concomitant action of IL-1 beta. Immunoprotective effect of rat recombinant IL-1 beta administrated i.p. to rats before cooling was revealed. It is suggested that IL-1 beta modulates immunological and neuroendocrine responses to stress and plays a critical physiological role in realization of stress reaction.

TI  - Expression of functional aromatic hydrocarbon receptor and aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator proteins in murine bone marrow stromal cells.  
AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) acting through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its dimerization partner, the AhR nuclear translocator protein (arnt), elicits numerous toxicological effects including immunosuppression and thymic atrophy. Previous work has shown that TCDD alters bone marrow prothymocyte populations. These effects could be mediated at the lymphocyte level directly and/or through effects on bone marrow stromal cells, a population important in the support of lymphopoiesis. The purpose of this study was to characterize AhR and arnt expression in three murine bone marrow stromal cell lines (S17, M2-10B4, and BMS2) and in primary stromal cell cultures. Immunoblot analysis detected AhR protein in M2-10B4 and BMS2 cells. AhR protein was also detected in the primary cultures. Arnt protein could be detected in all cell cultures. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays detected TCDD-dependent dioxin-responsive element (DRE) binding in all three cell lines. DNA binding was sequence-specific and dependent on AhR, as demonstrated by the addition of unlabeled DRE DNA or of anti-AhR antibody. Results obtained with the primary cultures paralleled those seen with the stromal cell lines. The ED50 for induction of TCDD-dependent DRE binding in M2-10B4 cells was 0.21 nM. TCDD treatment did not induce stromal P4501A1 mRNA expression but did increase P4501B1 mRNA levels in all three cell lines and in the primary cultures. These results indicate that murine bone marrow stromal cells express AhR and arnt proteins. Furthermore, these proteins are functional in terms of their DRE-binding ability and potential to regulate mRNA levels in a gene-specific fashion. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - Ultraviolet A radiation (320-400 nm) protects hairless mice from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet B radiation (280-320 nm) or cis-urocanic acid.  
AB  - T cell-mediated immune function, here measured as the contact hypersensitivity reaction, is readily suppressed by moderate exposure of mice to ultraviolet B (UVB) or solar-simulated radiation (SSUV), or by topical application of cis-urocanic acid. The effect of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation on immune function has been unclear. Here we have demonstrated that when UVA radiation from a fluorescent tube source was rigorously filtered to remove contaminating UVB radiation, it was immunologically innocuous at physiologically relevant doses. Furthermore, we have found that mice exposed to UVA radiation, either immediately after, or up to 24 h before, immunosuppressive treatment with either UVB radiation, SSUV or cis-urocanic acid, became refractory to the immunosuppression and retained more normal contact hypersensitivity. A greater UVA exposure reversed the immunosuppression more effectively. The results suggest that there are immunologically significant interactions between UV wavebands, and that UVA exposure may induce a relatively long-lived immunoprotective photoproduct, as yet unidentified, that can inhibit the activity of epidermal cis-urocanic acid and thus provide protection from photoimmunosuppression.

TI  - Incidence, prevalence, and clinical outcome of hepatitis GB-C virus infection in liver transplant patients.  
AB  - A novel RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family has been discovered recently and designated hepatitis GB-C virus (GBV-C). Previous studies have reported that GBV-C is associated with posttransfusion hepatitis, chronic viral hepatitis, and cryptogenic hepatitis. However, the clinical significance of GBV-C infection has been questioned increasingly in patients not undergoing transplantation. To investigate whether GBV-C infection under immunosuppression affects the clinical or the histological outcome in liver transplant recipients, we determined the prevalence and incidence of GBV-C infections and the clinical and histological signs in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The presence of GBV-C was tested in sera from patients before and in regular intervals up to 6 years after OLT by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from the NS3 region. A total of 72 patients were studied. Before OLT, 8 of 72 (11.1%) patients were positive for GBV-C. After OLT, 7 of 8 (87.5%) remained positive. Of 64 patients who were negative for GBV-C before OLT, 23 became positive after OLT, resulting in a de novo rate of GBV-C infection of 35.9%. We could not detect a higher rate of histologically proven hepatitis in GBV-C-positive patients (29.1%) than in GBV-C-negative patients (14.6%, P > 0.057). Comparing GBV-C-positive with GBV-C-negative liver transplant patients, we could not find any differences in age, gender, liver function tests, number of blood transfusions, histological degree of hepatitis, or number of rejection episodes. Survival was not negatively influenced by GBV-C positivity. In conclusion, the presence of GBV-C did not influence the clinical or histological outcome in liver transplant patients.

TI  - Rapid progression to invasive cervix cancer in a woman infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown an increased risk of cervical dysplasia in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as an increased risk of progression to higher-grade lesions. It is not known whether the rate of progression is accelerated over that in immunocompetent women. CASE: During September 1991, an HIV-positive woman underwent conization of the cervix showing carcinoma in situ. The surgical margins and endocervical curettings were negative for dysplasia. Papanicolaou smears 4 and 7 months after the conization also were negative. She then presented 33 months postconization with a stage Ib2 cervical carcinoma, which proved resistant to chemotherapy and pelvic radiation. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection may cause a more rapid progression of cervical intraepithelial lesions to carcinoma.

TI  - Immune regulation by the ST6Gal sialyltransferase.  
AB  - The ST6Gal sialyltransferase controls production of the Siaalpha2-6Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (Sia6LacNAc) trisaccharide, which is the ligand for the lectin CD22. Binding of CD22 to Sia6LacNAc is implicated in regulating lymphocyte adhesion and activation. We have investigated mice that lack ST6Gal and report that they are viable, yet exhibit hallmarks of severe immunosuppression unlike CD22-deficient mice. Notably, Sia6LacNAc-deficient mice display reduced serum IgM levels, impaired B cell proliferation in response to IgM and CD40 crosslinking, and attenuated antibody production to T-independent and T-dependent antigens. Deficiency of ST6Gal was further found to alter phosphotyrosine accumulation during signal transduction from the B lymphocyte antigen receptor. These studies reveal that the ST6Gal sialyltransferase and corresponding production of the Sia6LacNAc oligosaccharide are essential in promoting B lymphocyte activation and immune function.

TI  - Cellular immune responses of human cadaver donor bone marrow cells and their susceptibility to commonly used immunosuppressive drugs in transplantation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cascade of immunological effects brought about by donor bone marrow cell (DBMC) infusions in human organ transplantation, especially in the context of continuous pharmacologic immunosuppression, is not fully understood. Yet, in inbred rodents and even primates, administration of specific bone marrow cells has caused a state of acquired immunologic tolerance. METHODS: In vitro mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) culture systems were used to compare the responding and regulatory properties of DBMC and individual bone marrow cell subsets versus spleen cells in the presence or absence of pharmacologic immunosuppression. RESULTS: In the absence of immunosuppressive drugs, the DBMC proliferated in MLC and in response to phytohemagglutinin, but to a lower magnitude than donor spleen cells. In CML assays, DBMC failed to function as cytotoxic cells. Removal of both CD3+ and CD34+ cells together (not just singly) had to occur for complete abrogation of the proliferative response of DBMC evoked in the presence of allogeneic stimulating cells. Testing several experimental variables using flow cytometric analysis led to the conclusion that when purified DBMC CD34+ cells were placed in coculture with irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such CD34+ cells give rise both to CD3- TCRalphabeta+ as well as to dimly staining CD3+ TCRalphabeta+ cells. Low pharmacologic concentrations of tacrolimus/cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) singly or in combination had no effect on the spontaneous proliferation of DBMC and had significantly less inhibitory activity on MLC responses of DBMC and its purified CD3+ or CD34+ subpopulations, compared with the responses of spleen cells. Moreover, the previously described regulatory effects of DBMC on the MLC responses of peripheral blood or splenic responding cells were not inhibited by these immunosuppressive drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results support the notion that in vitro DBMC subpopulations, which proliferate as responding cells in co-culture with x-irradiated allogeneic cells and which cause regulatory effects when added as a third component to MLC reactions, seem to be culture-generated lymphoid cell lineage(s) progeny of CD34+ cells. This possibly includes unique CD3+ "primitive" (dimly staining) T cells, which are not as inhibited in their function by tacrolimus/CsA and MPA, as are postthymic (splenic) T cells.

TI  - Clinical intestinal transplantation: new perspectives and immunologic considerations.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although tacrolimus-based immunosuppression has made intestinal transplantation feasible, the risk of the requisite chronic high-dose treatment has inhibited the widespread use of these procedures. We have examined our 1990-1997 experience to determine whether immunomodulatory strategies to improve outlook could be added to drug treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-eight consecutive patients (59 children, 39 adults) with a panoply of indications received 104 allografts under tacrolimus-based immunosuppression: intestine only (n = 37); liver and intestine (n = 50); or multivisceral (n = 17). Of the last 42 patients, 20 received unmodified adjunct donor bone marrow cells; the other 22 were contemporaneous control patients. RESULTS: With a mean followup of 32 +/- 26 months (range, 1-86 months), 12 recipients (3 intestine only, 9 composite grafts) are alive with good nutrition beyond the 5-year milestone. Forty-seven (48%) of the total group survive bearing grafts that provide full (91%) or partial (9%) nutrition. Actuarial patient survival at 1 and 5 years (72% and 48%, respectively) was similar with isolated intestinal and composite graft recipients, but the loss rate of grafts from rejection was highest with intestine alone. The best results were in patients between 2 and 18 years of age (68% at 5 years). Adjunct bone marrow did not significantly affect the incidence of graft rejection, B-cell lymphoma, or the rate or severity of graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that longterm rehabilitation similar to that with the other kinds of organ allografts is achievable with all three kinds of intestinal transplant procedures, that the morbidity and mortality is still too high for their widespread application, and that the liver is significantly but marginally protective of concomitantly engrafted intestine. Although none of the endpoints were markedly altered by donor leukocyte augmentation (and chimerism) with bone marrow, establishment of the safety of this adjunct procedure opens the way to further immune modulation strategies that can be added to the augmentation protocol.

TI  - Occurrence of gammopathies and lymphoproliferative disorders in liver transplant recipients randomized to tacrolimus (FK506)- or cyclosporine-based immunosuppression.  
AB  - Lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are a serious side effect of immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and the introduction on the market of a new immunosuppressive drug has been associated with an increased risk of these disorders. To compare the effect of cyclosporine A (CSA) and FK506 in a clinical setting, the incidence of monoclonal or oligoclonal gammopathies known to often precede the appearance of LPDs was evaluated. A total of 88 adult patients was analyzed, 46 were prospectively randomized to CSA and 42 to FK506 for immunosuppression. None of these patients had gammopathy before transplantation. All the patients were tested for immunoglobulin abnormalities five to nine times during a period of 1 year and then two to four times per year thereafter from December 1990 until March 1997. The same incidence of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) abnormalities was observed in both groups (13%) with a mean delay of appearance of 11.1 +/- 5.9 versus 7.6 +/- 3.6 months for CSA and FK506, respectively (P > .05). In each group, the gammopathies were transient in 3 patients and persisted in 2. The class of Ig involved was IgG, and a monoclonal component was documented in 2 patients treated with CSA and in 3 patients with FK506. One patient treated with FK506 developed an LPD localized to the lymph nodes 8 months after the occurrence of serum protein abnormalities. The lymphoproliferative lesions subsequently disappeared with the reduction of immunosuppression. In this study, an immunosuppressive regimen of FK506 has not shown an increased incidence of lymphoproliferation compared with CSA in adult liver transplant patients.

TI  - Single-center long-term results of renal transplantation for IgA nephropathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous reports with short-term follow-up after renal transplantation for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) have suggested an incidence of recurrence up to 50%, an increased recurrence with living-related donors, and the rarity of graft loss due to recurrence. In this study, the long-term results of renal transplantation for IgAN were examined. METHODS: Between June 1980 and December 1994, 54 patients (61 renal transplants) with end-stage renal disease due to IgA nephropathy were performed at the University of California San Francisco. Actuarial patient and graft survival were compared with a matched reference group. Correlates of recurrent disease (biopsy confirmed) and graft loss were determined. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival for IgA patients were good (100% and 75%, respectively, at 5 years after transplant). Graft survival was lower in IgA recipients with living-related compared with cadaveric renal allografts (P<0.09) and also with renal allografts well matched at HLA-AB (< or =2 AB mismatches) (P<0.09) or HLA-DR (< or =1 mismatch) (P<0.01). Recurrence was not correlated with donor status, recipient age, race, gender, or immunosuppression. Recurrence (18 of 61) resulted in substantial graft loss (6 of 18) or deteriorating renal function (4 of 18) at a mean follow-up of 61 months. Mean time to diagnosis of recurrence and subsequent graft loss was 31 and 63 months, respectively. Despite re-recurrence of IgAN in three of five patients who were retransplanted, all have good long-term renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial graft loss due to recurrent disease after renal transplantation for IgAN occurs with long-term follow-up. Living-related transplantation and HLA matching do not appear to confer an advantage for graft survival in patients with IgAN. Despite the potential for recurrence, IgAN patients enjoy good long-term graft survival.

TI  - Corticosteroids induce expression of transforming-growth-factor-beta1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - The mechanisms by which corticosteroids act in the treatment of an acute relapse in multiple sclerosis (MS) are not completely known. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression of transforming-growth-factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), a cytokine with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive potentials, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum of 10 patients with an acute relapse of MS before, during and after the treatment with 500 mg prednisolone daily over 5 days. The expression of TGFbeta1-mRNA increased at day 3-5 and declined at day 8-10. Serum levels of TGFbeta1 demonstrated a comparable course. The present data suggest that corticosteroids induce the expression of TGFbeta1 in vivo. This is might be an other mechanism by which corticosteroids mediate immunosuppression.

AB  - Active immunization against hepatitis B virus infection was carried out in 162 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia attending the Outpatient Department at Tata Memorial Hospital. Recombinant DNA vaccine was given in three doses at 0, 1 and 2 months followed by a booster 1 year after the first dose. Antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen could be detected in 19.7% of patients following vaccination. Of these only 10.5% had titers in the protective range.  Immunosuppression induced by both disease and treatment appears to diminish responsiveness to vaccination. Passive active prophylaxis with both vaccine and immunoglobulin may be a more effective alternative in these patients.

TI  - Detection of herpesvirus-like sequences in Kaposi's sarcoma from heart transplant recipients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesvirus-like DNA sequences have been found in lesions from patients with Kaposi's sarcoma in its several forms, suggesting that this tumor may be caused by a new herpesvirus, referred to as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or human herpesvirus 8. METHODS: We analyzed DNA from skin and lung lesions, healthy skin, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of three heart transplant recipients with Kaposi's sarcoma. We also studied DNA from normal skin and from peripheral blood of Kaposi's sarcoma-free heart transplant recipients. Samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers to amplify the KS 330 sequence. Results: The KS 330 fragment was found in Kaposi's sarcoma tissue of all three patients, in normal skin of one of them, and in peripheral blood of two. It was not detected in any of the samples from skin or peripheral blood of heart transplant recipients not affected by Kaposi's sarcoma. DNA extracted from a peripheral blood sample of one patient before transplantation showed that the KS 330 sequence was already detectable at that time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of all forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. The development of the tumor in transplant recipients may be related, at least in some cases, to transplantation-associated immunosuppression, rather than to the acquisition of the virus from the donor.

TI  - Encephalopathy and progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease in a cohort of children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. Women and Infants Transmission Study Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, predictors, and survival of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy followed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical and immunologic staging of perinatally HIV-infected infants, based on the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Classification System. RESULTS: Data were available for 128 HIV-infected children, with a median follow-up of 24 months. HIV encephalopathy was diagnosed in 27 (21%) of children. Median survival after diagnosis was 14 months. Of children with encephalopathy, 74% had at least moderate immunosuppression by the time of diagnosis. Encephalopathy represented the first acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining condition in 67%, and the only one in 26% of children. Hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy during the first 3 months of life was diagnosed in 63%, in contrast to 29% of those without encephalopathy (p value = 0.001). Cardiomyopathy was present in 30% of the children with encephalopathy versus 2% of those without encephalopathy. High viral load in infancy was associated with increased risk of encephalopathy but was not predictive of age at onset. CONCLUSIONS: Encephalopathy in children with HIV is common and is associated with high viral load, immunodeficiency, and shortened survival. Encephalopathy was more likely to develop in infants with early signs and symptoms of HIV, although age at onset could not be predicted.

TI  - Successful treatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder with interferon-alpha and intravenous immunoglobulin.  
AB  - We report on the use of interferon-alpha (INF-a) and high-dose non-specific intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in 2 patients (a 60-yr-old female and a 65-yr-old male) who developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 2 and 8 months after heart and liver transplantation, respectively. Both patients had received immunosuppression with ATG, CsA, azathioprine, and prednisone. The first patient did not receive additional immunosuppression with biological agents. The second patient developed 3 steroid-resistant acute rejection episodes requiring OKT3 (cumulative dose 100 mg) and ATG (cumulative dose 3450 mg). The first patient presented with nodules involving the liver, spleen, lungs and nasophar, ynx. The second patient presented with subcutaneous and liver nodules, as well as pert-portal and para-aortic lymphadenopathies. The histological diagnosis was diffuse B-cell PTLD in both patients. Despite reduction of immunosuppression, a progression of lesions was observed in both patients over 5 months and 2 months, respectively. The first patient received INF-alpha (2 x 10(6) IU, s.c. 3 times/wk) and IVIg (0.5 g/kg i.v. every 15 d) for.4 months, while the second patient received the same therapy for 12 and 7 months, respectively. Complete disappearance of all lesions was observed after 3 months of therapy in the first patient and after 7 months of therapy in the second patient, as assessed by CT scan. PTLD remains in remission 47 and 33 months after therapy, respectively. Our preliminary results suggest that the combination of INF-alpha and IVIg can be an effective therapy for PTLD which does not respond to reduction of immunosuppression.

TI  - Behaviorally conditioned effects of Cyclosporine A on the immune system of rats: specific alterations of blood leukocyte numbers and decrease of granulocyte function.  
AB  - Immunosuppression induced by Cyclosporine A (CsA) can be behaviorally conditioned. It is unknown, however, whether a taste aversion paradigm using CsA as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) induces alterations of blood leukocyte numbers and function. Results obtained by three-colour flow cytometry and granulocyte chemiluminescence response demonstrate that in conditioned rats, absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets, including B, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ naive and memory T cells, and granulocyte numbers and function were significantly decreased. In contrast to the conditioned response, CsA treatment alone increased lymphocyte numbers and did not affect granulocyte function. Thus, our data demonstrate that behaviorally conditioned CsA effects can be monitored in the blood. In addition, results indicate that the CNS mediates the behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression by reducing the availability and function of granulocytes and lymphocytes.

TI  - Early cyclosporine monotherapy in liver transplantation: a 5-year follow-up of a prospective, randomized trial.  
AB  - Maintenance of adequate immunosuppression and avoidance of side-effects are the goals of long-term management of all organ-transplanted patients. We here report the final results of a prospective, randomized trial comparing early cyclosporine monotherapy versus double-drug therapy (cyclosporine and steroids) in adult liver transplantation patients. One hundred four patients were randomized 3 months after transplantation either to continue (Group I = 50 patients) or to stop steroids (Group II = 54 patients). Patients on a double-drug regimen were maintained long term on methylprednisolone at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/d. Target cyclosporine trough levels were between 150 and 250 ng/mL in both groups. Our main points of interest were the prevalence of acute and chronic rejections and steroid-related side-effects in the two groups of patients. Mean follow-up was 41 +/- 16 months (range, 4-68 months). Patient actuarial survival 2 and 5 years after randomization was similar in the two groups (82% vs. 83% and 82% vs. 77%). The prevalence of acute rejections after randomization was, respectively, 8% and 4%. A single episode of chronic rejection was observed only in a patient on long-term steroid therapy. Side-effects of steroid therapy were less frequent in patients weaned off steroids, and when considering hypertension and diabetes, the differences between the two groups were statistically significant. Early cyclosporine monotherapy is a safe undertaking in liver transplantation because it allows a significant reduction of steroid-related side-effects without increasing the risk of acute and chronic rejection. After 5 years, patient survival was similar in patients with or without steroids.

AB  - Six hundred male turkeys were maintained in floor pens for 5 wk at which time half of the birds were given three intramuscular injections of 2 mg/kg BW of dexamethasone (DEX) on alternating days. On the day of the third DEX injection, the left thoracic air sac of each bird was injected with sterile tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) or with TPB containing approximately 1 x 10(2), 1 x 10(3), 1 x 10(4), or 1 x 10(5) cfu of Escherichia coli. All mortalities and birds necropsied at 14 and 15 d postchallenge were scored for air sacculitis/pericarditis (AS) and turkey osteomyelitis complex (TOC). Cumulative mortality and AS score were both increased by either DEX treatment or E. coli. Although TOC incidence was significantly increased by the lowest titer of E. coli inoculation, increasing the number of bacteria inoculated did not increase TOC incidence due to increased mortality before TOC lesions developed. The DEX treatment by itself increased TOC incidence and there was a synergistic interaction between DEX treatment and E. coli on TOC incidence. Both DEX treatment and E. coli significantly decreased BW. Relative weights of liver, heart, and spleen were significantly increased by both E. coli and DEX, whereas both treatments significantly decreased relative weight of the bursa of Fabricius. The number of positive bacterial isolations from tissue and the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio were increased by both DEX treatment and E. coli challenge. These results suggest that stress-induced immunosuppression may be involved in the etiology of TOC, and that bacterial respiratory infection can lead to the development of TOC lesions.

TI  - An immunoaffinity-purified Trypanosoma cruzi antigen suppresses cellular proliferation through a TGF-beta-mediated mechanism.  
AB  - Two subfractions with opposite immunological properties were obtained from the flagellar antigens (FF) of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes by immunoaffinity chromatography. The ligand-bound material (Ag 123) contained four polypeptide bands of 97, 55, 38 and 14 kDa. The nonretained flow-through (FT), induced a potent proliferation of murine naive splenocytes. In contrast, Ag 123 inhibited the proliferative capacity of the FT as well as the proliferation mediated by the mitogen Concanavalin A (Con A). The suppressive effect of Ag 123 on the Con A-mediated proliferation was neutralized by an anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody. Both Ag 123 and FF stimulated high serum levels of TGF-beta in injected mice. Ag 123 also induced in vitro secretion of TGF-beta by murine splenocytes. These results demonstrate that Ag 123 is a potent stimulator of TGF-beta both in vivo and in vitro. Oligopeptides derived from the 38 kDa protein present in Ag 123 showed homology with human and rat alpha-fetoproteins (AFP). Ag 123 seems to have a key role in the immunosuppression that develops during early stages in the infection with T. cruzi.

TI  - [Immunology in clinical practice IX. Systemic vasculitis]  
AB  - A diagnosis of vasculitis generally requires histopathological proof of vasculitis, particularly because many other disease entities may mimic vasculitis ('vasculitis-look-alikes'). Vasculitis can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other diseases, especially infectious diseases. The primary vasculitides are classified according to the size of the vessels involved and the nature of the inflammation, in combination with clinical symptoms. The detection of autoantibodies, particularly the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), in some of the primary vasculitides, has facilitated the diagnosis of those diseases and has given more insight into their pathophysiology. Treatment of primary vasculitis still consists of corticosteroids whether or not in combination with immunosuppression. New insights in pathophysiology may provide more specific and less toxic treatment modalities.

TI  - Early development of Epstein-Barr virus-associated T-cell lymphoma after a living-related renal transplantation.  
AB  - We herein report a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated T-cell lymphoma that developed within a month after a kidney transplantation. The recipient was a 37-year-old man who had evidence of a previous EBV infection. Cyclosporine, methylprednisolone, and azathioprine were used for immunosuppression, and acute rejection was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone. The lactate dehydrogenase level started to increase on day 24 and thereafter peaked on day 37 while also demonstrating progressive jaundice and a bleeding tendency. A transplant nephrectomy was done on day 37; however, the patient could not recover and eventually died of respiratory failure as a result of diffuse pulmonary edema. A pathological examination of the resected kidney revealed a diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells in the parenchyma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD45 and T-cell marker, CD45RO, but negative for B-cell markers. EBV-encoded RNA was demonstrated within the neoplastic cells by in situ hybridization.

TI  - Immunosuppression and nitric oxide production induced by parenteral live Salmonella vaccines do not correlate with protective capacity: a phoP::Tn10 mutant does not suppress but does protect.  
AB  - Previous work from our laboratory showed that an aroA mutant strain of S. typhimurium, SL3235, induces profound immunosuppression 7 days post-parenteral inoculation, and that the suppression is mediated by nitric oxide. Suppression was measured by the capacity of spleen cells to mount a primary in vitro plaque-forming cell response to sheep red blood cells in Mishell-Dutton cultures. In the present studies, the capacity of a panel of strains of attenuated Salmonella with various genetic lesions was tested. Most of the strains were S. typhimurium, but several were S. dublin. It was found that a variety of Salmonella strains induced suppression, demonstrating that suppressive capacity is not unique to SL3235 or to S. typhimurium. A strong correlation was obtained between the log10 of the microbial burden (cfu spleen-1) on the seventh day post-vaccine inoculation and the degree of immunosuppression. Strains that gave high spleen counts gave greater suppression. Microbial burden also correlated with the size of the spleen and the amount of nitrite produced by spleen-cell cultures, a measure of nitric oxide. Finally, the degree of immunosuppression was found to be linearly related to the log10 of the amount of nitrite produced. The capacity of the various strains of Salmonella to protect against challenge with virulent S. typhimurium, strain W118-2, was also tested. No correlation was found between suppressive and protective capacities of the various strains. Two strains suppressed, but did not protect. While most strains that protected grew or persisted in vivo, a phoP::Tn10 mutant of S. typhimurium did not grow or persist; this phoP mutant did not cause immunosuppression, but gave 100% protection against challenge with wild type S. typhimurium, suggesting that such mutants have advantageous properties as live vaccines.

TI  - Chronic hepatitis in children after liver transplantation: role of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis G virus infections.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic graft hepatitis occurs in 20-30% adults after liver transplantation but the prevalence and causes in children are not known. In adults, hepatitis C virus infection is prevalent prior to transplantation and recurrent infection is a frequent cause of graft dysfunction. The significance of the recently described hepatitis G virus infection remains unproven. The aim of this study was to examine the role of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis G virus infection in chronic graft hepatitis after paediatric liver transplantation. METHODS: The prevalence of graft hepatitis and the role of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis G virus infections in 80 children after liver transplantation have been studied, with a median follow up of 4.4 years (range 0.4 to 10.7), and the persistence of hepatitis G infection in the presence of immunosuppression has been determined. RESULTS: Chronic graft hepatitis was diagnosed in 19/80 (24%) children and was most frequently seen in children transplanted for cryptogenic cirrhosis (71%). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of chronic hepatitis in those transplanted before or after donor anti-HCV screening. Hepatitis C infection occurred in three children transplanted prior to donor screening but in only one was associated with chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis G infection was found in 22/79 (28%) transplant recipients but was not associated with graft hepatitis. In 17/21 children hepatitis G infection persisted for a median of 5.2 years after transplantation. CONCLUSION: Chronic hepatitis occurred in 24% of children after liver transplantation, a similar prevalence to that in adults. Cryptogenic liver disease predisposed to graft hepatitis, but neither hepatitis C nor hepatitis G infection was associated. Hepatitis G virus caused a frequent and usually persistent infection after transplantation.

TI  - Chronic episodic diarrhoea associated with apparent intestinal colonisation by the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida famata in a German shepherd dog.  
AB  - A 3-year-old German shepherd dog was presented with a history of lifelong episodic diarrhoea. An adverse reaction to food was considered the most likely cause of the diarrhoea. The dog had received prolonged antibiotic therapy for most of its life as well as receiving probiotics containing the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (syn. S. boulardi) for a year before referral. The probiotic was discontinued 2 months before to referral. Examination and culture of faecal samples identified yeast-like organisms, S. cerevisiae and Candida famata. S. cerevisiae has been isolated from humans in association with predisposing conditions such as prolonged sojourns in hospital, immunosuppression, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and prosthetic devices, but is regarded as non-pathogenic in humans and is rarely associated with disease in animals. C. famata has been isolated from animals, humans and the environment, but is regarded as a very rare pathogen. No evidence of immunosuppression was found in the dog. The presence of yeasts in the faecal isolates and the history of prolonged use of antibiotics and probiotics with a concurrent adverse reaction to food, suggest that conditions may have occurred within the bowel that made it possible for the yeasts to colonise parts of it. This has apparently not been reported before.

TI  - Cyclosporine A affects open field behavior in DA rats.  
AB  - Since the introduction of Cyclosporine A (CsA) for immunosuppression in solid-organ transplantation, the rate of allograft rejection has decreased substantially. However, treatment with CsA induces neuropsychological complications in patients, including affective disorders such as anxiety, disorientation, depression, aggression, paranoia, and apathy. These CsA-induced affective side effects cannot be extensively studied in humans. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of intraperitoneal CsA (20 mg/kg) injections on the open-field behavior of male Dark Agouti (DA) rats 1, 6, 12, and 23 h after drug administration on 3 consecutive days. CsA induced an increase in emotionality in DA rats 6 h after injection, reflected by decreased ambulatory activity in the open field and increased defecation. In addition, a decrease in rearing activity was observed 12 h after CsA administration. These behavioral alterations are discussed in the view of changes in cytokine profiles induced by CsA.

TI  - Decreased immunosuppressive effect of cortisol on natural killer cytotoxic activity in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.  
AB  - Former studies have indicated alterations of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells in senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). These changes may be related to the increased reactivity of NK cells with cytokines, even if an impairment of the immunosuppressive effect of glucocorticoids cannot be excluded. In the present study we have demonstrated a lower immunosuppressive effect of cortisol on NK cytolytic function in patients with SDAT than in healthy elders and in patients with dementia of multi-infarct origin (MID). This suppression is completely lacking when cortisol is employed at low concentrations (10(-7) M) and is significantly reduced after incubation at physiological (10(-6) M; p < 0.001) and supraphysiological concentrations (10(-5) M; p < 0.001). The addition of IL-2 (50 and 100 IU/ml/cells) significantly antagonizes the effects of cortisol in SDAT, whereas the cortisol-dependent immunosuppression is partially maintained in healthy elders and in patients with MID. Our data indicate that the defect of the immunosuppressive effect of cortisol may play a role in NK dysregulation in SDAT, contributing to the cytokine-mediated NK overactivity in this disease.

TI  - [Indication for the steroid therapy for acute rejection]  
AB  - Between January 1, 1986 and March 31, 1997, 103 kidney transplantations were performed at our institution. Seventy-nine grafts were from living related donors; one was from a living unrelated donor; 23 were from cadaveric donors.  Basic immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporin (CYA), azathioprine (AZ) and methylprednisolone (MP). Twenty of these grafts (14.9%) developed steroid resistant rejection (SRR). The 5-year graft survival rate of patients with SRR (57.9%) was lower than that with no rejection (92.9%) and steroid responded rejection ( 85.6%). (p = 0.002) Treatment methods of SRR were methylprednisolone pulse (n = 5), plasma exchange (n = 7) and others (n = 8) such as, OKT 3, 15-deoxyspergualin, anti-thymocyte globulin, Tacrolimus rescue and cyclosporin rescue. No significant differences could be seen on the 5-year graft survival between the 3 groups. We reviewed 9 episodes of acute rejection, and compared the Banff classification with the degree of reversibility of rejection. Of the 9 biopsies examined, 5 were classified as borderline change, 2 had mild rejection (grade I), 2 had moderate rejection (grade II), 1 had severe rejection (grade III). Complete reversal of rejection by steroids was observed in only 3 patients; 2 were borderline and one was grade II.

TI  - Experimental toxoplasmosis, and immunosuppression (parasite evaluation and histological alterations) [published erratum appears in Rev Hosp Clin Fac Med Sao Paulo 1998 Jan-Feb;53(1):21]  
AB  - With the purpose of studying immunosuppressant drug action on parasites, the effect of Cyclosporine and cortisone in experimental toxoplasma evaluation, a highly virulent strain of Toxoplasma gondii (RH strain) was used. The animals were divided in two groups: control and immunosuppressed. Two animals from each group were sacrificed daily. Evaluation was based on parasitemia and parasitism of peritoneal exsudate and presence of the parasite in heart, lung, liver, spleen, small bowel, brain, cerebellum, spinal cord and eyes. Parasite infestation in peritoneal exsudate was 10 times greater than parasitemia. Red spots were observed after the second day; after the fourth day, focal necrosis with softening and fluidification of brain tissue spattered throughout the nervous tissue with enhanced vascularization. Capillaries obstructed by Toxoplasmas gondii were found, causing infarction and necrosis due to toxic or enzymatic substances. Images suggestive of cells an "owl-eye", Cytomegalovirus-like were found, with T. gondii, both in the brain, as well as in the tear glands and small bowel. Blood stream parasite infestation was observed, no histopathological lesions were found in the remaining tissue, possibly due to lack of time, for all animals died within a week's observation. We conclude that immunosuppression has worsened the outcome, anticipating the disease in 24 hours.

Furthermore, administration of fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids is a new and exciting idea in glucocorticoid therapy in that small amounts of oral DH-D may pass the liver largely unmetabolized (11 beta-HSD-I has low affinity for such steroids) and may then be activated to D by high-affinity 11 beta-HSD-II, thus allowing selective immunosuppression in organs expressing 11 beta-HSD-II (kidney and colon).

TI  - Metabolism of synthetic corticosteroids by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases in man.  
AB  - The presence of an 11 beta-hydroxyl group is essential for the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids. Interconversion of the 11 beta-hydroxyl into the corresponding 11 beta-keto group and vice versa by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) may thus play a pivotal role in the efficacy of these steroids. Therefore, we have compared the metabolism of the endogenous glucocorticoid cortisol (F) with that of synthetic 9 alpha-fluorinated steroids by 11 beta-HSDs in humans in vivo and in vitro. Whereas 30% of the free steroids in urine after oral administration of 5 mg of F is F itself and 70% the inactive keto-product cortisone (E), the urinary excretion of an identical dose of oral 9 alpha-fluorocortisol (9 alpha FF) is 90% 9 alpha FF and 10% inactive 9 alpha-fluorocortisone (9 alpha FE). Kidney slices similarly convert F much faster to E than 9 alpha FF to 9 alpha FE; conversely, renal 11 beta-reduction of 9 alpha FE to 9 alpha FF is much more effective than that of E to F. Kinetic analyses in human kidney cortex microsomes prove that the preference of fluorinated steroids for reduction in human kidney slices is catalyzed by 11 beta-HSD type II: the NADH-dependent conversion of 11-dehydro-dexamethasone (DH-D), another fluorinated steroid, to dexamethasone (D) is very effective (high affinity, high Vmax), whereas reduction of E to F is very slow. In human liver microsomes (11 beta-HSD type I), nonfluorinated (E) and fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids (DH-D) are both reduced to their corresponding active 11-hydroxyderivatives but with a Michaelis-Menten constant about 20-fold higher than for kidney microsomes (11 beta-HSD-II). Our results suggest that the decreased renal 11 beta-oxidation of 9 alpha-fluorinated steroids may offer pharmacokinetic advantages for renal immunosuppression. Furthermore, administration of fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids is a new and exciting idea in glucocorticoid therapy in that small amounts of oral DH-D may pass the liver largely unmetabolized (11 beta-HSD-I has low affinity for such steroids) and may then be activated to D by high-affinity 11 beta-HSD-II, thus allowing selective immunosuppression in organs expressing 11 beta-HSD-II (kidney and colon).

TI  - Ovicidal activity of neem products (azadirachtin) against Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae).  
AB  - Bioactive compounds contained in the seed kernel and other parts of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) have been found to show insecticidal activities and other effects in many species of insects. These activities include antifeedancy, growth regulation, fecundity suppression, male sterility, oviposition repellency, changes in biological fitness such as loss of flying ability, immunodepression, enzyme inhibition, splitting of biological rhythms, and so forth. We investigated the ovicidal effects of various formulations of azadrirachtin (AZ) against the mosquitoes Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The formulations tested were wettable powder Azad WP10, emulsifiable concentrate Azad EC4.5, and technically pure AZ. The ovicidal activity of the test neem products was influenced by concentration of AZ, age of the egg rafts, and age of the neem preparations. Other factors such as formulation and mosquito species were also involved in the degree of ovicidal activity. When the egg rafts were deposited directly in fresh neem suspension and left there for 4 h before transfer to untreated water, 1 ppm of AZ produced almost 100% mortality in eggs. When egg rafts aged for 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h were exposed to 10 ppm neem suspensions for 36 h, the ovicidal activity was only attained in the egg rafts deposited directly (0 h old) in the neem suspension, not in those with ages of 4-24 h. On aging, depending on the formulations and mosquito species, the neem suspensions at 1 ppm completely lost ovicidal activity within 7-20 days. The egg rafts of Cx. quinquefasciatus were more susceptible to the test neem products than those of Cx. tarsalis. The formulated neem products were more persistent and effective than the technical AZ. The wettable powder (WP) formulation was slightly more persistent and effective than the emulsifiable concentrate (EC). The ovicidal activity of the neem products against mosquitoes from the current research clearly demonstrated the potential of neem products as possible ovicides against Culex mosquitoes.

TI  - Donor-specific portal blood transfusion in intestinal transplantation: a prospective, preclinical large animal study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unlike in kidney and heart transplantation, the role of pretransplant donor-specific blood transfusion (DST) has not been studied prospectively in a large animal model of bowel transplantation. We investigated the impact of portal versus systemic DST on overall survival, rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infection after total (small and large) bowel transplantation in pigs. METHODS: Mixed lymphocyte culture-reactive, outbred pigs underwent total enterectomy and orthotopic total bowel transplantation with portal vein graft drainage. One unit of donor blood was transfused via the portal or systemic circulation (according to a randomization protocol) before graft implantation was begun. We studied six groups, all of which underwent at least a total bowel transplant: group 1 (n=5) comprised nonimmunosuppressed control pigs with portal DST; group 2 (n=6), nonimmunosuppressed control pigs with systemic DST; group 3 (n=5), cyclosporine (CsA)-treated pigs with portal DST; group 4 (n=5), CsA-treated pigs with systemic DST; group 5 (n=5), tacrolimus-treated pigs with portal DST; and group 6 (n=5), tacrolimus-treated pigs with systemic DST. All immunosuppressed pigs received prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) and either CsA (to maintain levels between 250 and 350 ng/ml) or tacrolimus (to maintain levels between 10 and 30 ng/ml). Stomal biopsies and autopsies were obtained to study the incidence of rejection, GVHD, and infection. RESULTS: Portal DST and tacrolimus-based immunosuppression resulted in the highest survival rates. At 7, 14, and 28 days after transplantation, survival rates in group 5 were 100%, 100%, and 80%; in group 6, 100%, 60%, and 40%; and in group 3, 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Only the combination of portal DST and tacrolimus prevented the occurrence of, and death from, rejection. Death from rejection at 7, 14, and 28 days in group 5 was 0%, 0%, and 0%; in group 6, 0%, 33%, and 67%; and in group 3, 0%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Of note, if immunosuppression was used, the groups with portal (versus systemic) DST had a higher risk of death from infection but a lower risk of death from GVHD. Simultaneous immunologic events were noted more frequently in groups with systemic (versus portal) DST. Long-term survival was noted only in groups with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and was more common for those with portal (versus systemic) DST. CONCLUSIONS: Portal DST at the time of total bowel transplantation and posttransplant immunosuppression with tacrolimus prevent rejection and significantly increase graft survival. The combination of portal antigen presentation and tacrolimus needs to be studied in clinical bowel transplantation.

TI  - Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression using cyclosporine A: central nervous system reduces IL-2 production via splenic innervation.  
AB  - Bi-directional interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and immune system are demonstrated by the modification of immune function using behavioral conditioning. However, the mechanisms by which the CNS achieves conditioned immunomodulation are still in question. Here, we report that the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) can be behaviorally conditioned in rats using saccharin as a gustatory conditioned stimulus. The conditioned effects were compared to control groups that received CsA paired with water (sham-conditioned), CsA injection on test days (CsA-treated), and unhandled rats (untreated). In conditioned animals, the mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen is significantly suppressed, and the survival time of heterotopic heart allografts prolonged. These effects are paralleled by conditioned inhibition of IL-2 and IFN-gamma synthesis by splenocytes. Furthermore, the CNS-induced immunosuppression is mediated neuronally and not via the blood, since the conditioned reduction of proliferation and cytokine production is completely abrogated after surgical denervation of the spleen. Thus, during conditioning, the CNS learns to reinstate at demand a CsA-like immunosuppression via splenic innervation. This might be used as a supportive therapy for controlling immune functions.

TI  - Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in bronchial epithelium after lung transplantation in the rat.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The normal, mature airway epithelium in experimental animals has a very slow cell turnover and minimal proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an index of bronchial cell proliferation in the Brown Norway to Lewis rat pulmonary allograft model with or without immunosuppression. METHODS: Brown Norway left lungs were transplanted into Lewis recipients. Some recipients were treated with a high dose of cyclosporine and FK506. Lewis-to-Lewis donor-recipient combination was performed as a control. Lungs were excised on postoperative days 3 and 5. Routinely processed, paraffin-embedded sections were prepared and stained by PCNA. Counts of PCNA-positive cells in the perivascular cellular infiltrate and bronchial surface epithelium were compared with the histologic grade of rejection. RESULTS: The PCNA index (percent of nuclei immunostaining for PCNA) in bronchial surface epithelium was significantly higher in allografts (21.0% +/- 3.1% at 3 days, 31.4% +/- 9.8 % at 5 days, p < 0.05) than in isografts (5.4% +/- 3.0% at 3 days, 4.7% +/- 4.6% at 5 days). The PCNA index was also greater in the perivascular infiltrates of rejecting lungs (23.9% +/- 3.7% at 3 days, 29.1% +/- 6.6% at 5 days). However, in the cyclosporine- and FK506-treated groups, the PCNA index in bronchial surface epithelium was suppressed to less than 5% at 3 and 5 days. Even at 50 days after transplantation, PCNA-positive cells were rare in bronchial epithelium of FK506-treated grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial epithelium in isografts has a relatively low rate of proliferation. In rejection, allografts have a very rapid cell turnover and proliferation. Proliferating epithelium may be a consequence of immune events or it may contribute to the pathogenesis of those events.

TI  - Role of adjuvant treatment in liver transplantation for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.  
AB  - The results of liver transplantation for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma have been disappointing because of high recurrence rates, leading to low long-term survival; this indication remains controversial in an era of organ shortage. To continue to offer this treatment possibility, efforts were made to reduce recurrence and improve survival. The first approach is to maintain a strict selection policy excluding patients with extraheptic disease. The second approach is to test the efficacy of perioperative adjuvant therapies in patients selected for transplantation. The reasons for recurrence include: (1) undetected preoperative micrometastases, (2) intraoperative dissemination by surgical manipulation, and (3) acceleration of tumor growth by immunosuppression. Preoperative treatment, which may include systemic chemotherapy or arterial chemoembolization, seems necessary to limit tumor progression during the waiting period. Systemic chemotherapy has been tested pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. It is considered essential postoperatively and should be used as soon as possible after surgery (i.e., in the 1st postoperative week). Several teams have performed pilot studies that included rather limited numbers of patients, and the results were compared with those for historic controls. Published results show that chemoembolization creates tumor necrosis in most instances. This is efficient in limiting tumor progression but the effect on recurrence and survival is unknown. All authors who used postoperative chemotherapy reported improved survival over controls, with 50%-60% 3-year survival and up to 50% 5-year survival. However, recent results suggest that late recurrence may occur. Chemotherapy was usually well tolerated, although leukopenia, sometimes severe, was observed in most patients. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor seems useful to overcome this problem. Perioperative adjuvant treatments seem to prolong survival in patients undergoing liver transplantation for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but delayed recurrence remains possible. Further studies are necessary; these should ideally be multicentric, prospective, and randomized.

AB  - Previous work from our laboratory has shown that chronic alcohol consumption in mice creates immunosuppression sufficient to permit infection with the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis carinii. Host defense against P. carinii is critically dependent upon host T lymphocytes. In these experiments, we address the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on recruitment of T lymphocytes into infected lung tissue and on lymphocytes in host lymphoid tissue. We find that mice administered alcohol in drinking water and then inoculated with P. carinii show significantly decreased recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes into lung tissue in comparison with control mice. Additional experiments show significant depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes in spleens from alcohol mice and decreased numbers of activated T lymphocytes. Analysis of surface expression of the adhesion molecules LFA-1, VLA-4, and ICAM-1 show no significant differences in lymphocytes from alcohol-consuming mice, and lymphocyte chemotaxis in vitro is also unaltered. We conclude that chronic consumption of alcohol impairs lung recruitment of lymphocytes in response to an infectious challenge. This impaired lymphocyte recruitment may be a consequence of depletion of T lymphocytes in host lymphoid tissue. Impaired recruitment of lymphocytes may explain the increased morbidity and mortality of pulmonary infections in alcoholic subjects.

TI  - Overview of the epidemiology of immunodeficiency-associated cancers.  
AB  - Immunodeficiency, be it congenital, therapeutic, or infectious in origin, increases the risk of certain, but not all, types of cancer. A common feature of these cancers is that specific infectious agents appear to be important in their etiology, not only in immunodeficient subjects but also in the general population. People with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are at an increased risk of Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and childhood leiomyosarcoma. It is striking that most of these cancers have been associated with specific human herpesvirus (HHV) infections: HHV-8 with Kaposi's sarcoma and the closely related Epstein-Barr virus with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and possibly also with childhood leiomyosarcoma. Moreover, similar associations between these viruses and cancer have been found, albeit inconsistently, in people who are not immunosuppressed. Further research is needed to establish whether the risk of other cancers is also increased in people with AIDS, although, if so, the cancers are likely to be rare or to have comparatively small associated relative risks. Existing evidence suggests that there may be no marked increase in the risk of two common cancers that are known to be caused by infectious agents--hepatocellular carcinoma and invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The apparent lack of an increase in invasive cervical cancer is unexpected and needs further investigation, especially since the prevalence of cervical infection with human papillomaviruses and of low-grade preneoplastic changes in the cervical epithelium is increased in women with AIDS. With the prospect of improved survival in people with AIDS, the effect of immunosuppression on cancer is likely to become an increasingly important issue.

TI  - Orthotopic xenografts of human melanoma and colonic and ovarian carcinoma in sheep to evaluate radioimmunotherapy.  
AB  - Extrapolation to humans from experimental radioimmunotherapy in nude mouse xenograft models is confounded by large relative tumour size and small volume of distribution in mice allowing tumour uptake of radiolabelled antibodies unattainable in patients. Our large animal model of human tumours in cyclosporin-immunosuppressed sheep demonstrated tumour uptake of targeted radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies comparable with uptakes reported in clinical trials.  Sheep immunosuppression with daily intravenous cyclosporin augmented by oral ketoconazole maintained trough blood levels of cyclosporin within the range 1000-1500 ng ml(-1). Human tumour cells were transplanted orthotopically by inoculation of 10(7) cells: SKMEL melanoma subcutaneously; LS174T and HT29 colon carcinoma into bowel, peritoneum and liver; and JAM ovarian carcinoma into ovary and peritoneum. Tumour xenografts grew at all sites within 3 weeks of inoculation, preserving characteristic morphology without evidence of necrosis or host rejection. Lymphatic metastasis was demonstrated in regional nodes draining xenografts of melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. Colonic LS1 74T xenografts produced mucin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The anti-CEA IgG1 monoclonal antibody A5B7 was radiolabelled with iodine-131 and administered intravenously to sheep. Peak uptake at 5 days in orthotopic human tumour transplants in gut was 0.027% DI g(-1) (percentage of injected dose per gram) and 0.034% DI g(-1) in hepatic metastases with tumour to blood ratios of 2-2.5. Non-specific tumour uptake in melanoma was 0.003% DI g(-1). Uptake of radiolabelled monoclonal antibody in human tumours in our large animal model is comparable with that observed in patients and may be more realistic than nude mice xenografts for prediction of clinical efficacy of radioimmunotherapy.

TI  - Retroviral marking of canine bone marrow: long-term, high-level expression of human interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain in canine lymphocytes.  
AB  - Optimization of retroviral gene transfer into hematopoietic cells of the dog will facilitate gene therapy of canine X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) and in turn advance similar efforts to treat human XSCID. Both canine and human XSCID are caused by defects in the common gamma chain, gammac, of receptors for interleukin-2 and other cytokines. In this study, normal dogs were given retrovirally transduced bone marrow cells with and without preharvest mobilization by the canine growth factors granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF). Harvey sarcoma virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus constructs were used, both containing cDNA encoding human gammac. The Harvey-based vector transduced into cytokine-primed marrow yielded persistent detectable provirus in bone marrow and blood and expression of human gammac on peripheral lymphocytes. In three dogs, human gammac expression disappeared after 19 to 34 weeks but reappeared and was sustained, in one dog beyond 16 months posttransplantation, upon immunosuppression with cyclosporin A and prednisone, with up to 25% of lymphocytes expressing human gammac. The long-term expression of human gammac in a high proportion of normal canine lymphocytes predicts that retrovirus-mediated gene correction of hematopoietic cells may prove to be of clinical benefit in humans affected with this XSCID. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.

TI  - [Interactions between the immune system and the psyche]  
AB  - Compared to well documented studies on immunosuppression "psychologically induced immunoenhancement" is a rather neglected topic in medical literature and research, even in the new established field of psychoneuroimmunology. Starting with the premise that research questions emanating from this field and from behavioural medicine may provide critical information for understanding the phenomena of immunomodulation, evidence and illustrations of psychologically induced immunoenhancement are provided in the context of psychosocial neuroimmunomodulation. Distress-reducing interventions such as progressive relaxation training, imagery, experimentally induced short-term positive mood states and mirthful laughter enhances various aspects of immune functions, i.e., primarily the phylogenetically old paraspecific parameters. Additionally, a larger variety of emotional/psychosocial factors with potentially but yet unproved immunoenhancing effects seems to exist. In particular, enhancement of phagocytosis, NK cell and T cell response to phytohemagglutinin, decrease in the number of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells and increase in the number of circulating T helper/inducer cells in peripheral blood, and enhancement of spontaneous lymphocyte blastogenesis as well as cytokines have all been shown to be associated with the above mentioned intervention techniques.

TI  - Modulation of the immune response by changing neuromediator systems activity under stress.  
AB  - The possible correction of the immune response affecting the mechanisms of neuroimmunomodulation in the animal model of immobilization stress is considered. Immobilization (3 h on the back) of CBA mice caused a suppression of the immune response. The number of plaque-forming cell (PFC) on the 4th day as well as rosette-forming cell (RFC) number on the 5th day of the immune reaction to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were found to be reduced as compared to the control. Immunoinhibition in the stressed mice was reversed by the depletion of the cerebral serotonin (5-HT) with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) 2 days before immobilization at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Activation of postsynaptic D-1 and D-2 dopamine (DA) receptors with apomorphine administered 30 min before stress attenuated stress-induced immunosuppression as well. Thus, the immunosuppression elicited by a stressor can be modified by drugs influencing the 5-HT and DAergic systems. It is suggested that the stress-provoked alterations of the immune response can be a consequence of changing neurochemical pattern of the brain and the disturbances of the mechanisms of psychoneuroimunomodulation.

TI  - The gamma interferon gene knockout mouse: a highly sensitive model for evaluation of therapeutic agents against Cryptosporidium parvum.  
AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is a serious disease in malnourished children and in people with malignancies or AIDS. Current rodent models for evaluating drug therapy against cryptosporidiosis have many limitations, including the need for a high inoculum, the absence of symptoms resembling those seen in humans, and the need to maintain exogenous immunosuppression. We have developed a gamma interferon knockout (GKO) mouse model with which to evaluate therapies against C. parvum and have used paromomycin for evaluation of this model. The GKO model offers considerable improvements over other systems, since it requires no additional immunosuppression and adult mice can be infected with as few as 10 oocysts (compared with 10(7) for SCID mice). Infected mice develop profound gastrointestinal dysfunction due to extensive infection and severe mucosal damage involving the entire small intestine. Clinical symptoms, which include depression, anorexia, weight loss, and wasting, result in death within 2 to 4 weeks. The time of death depends on the oocyst challenge dose. Paromomycin modulated parasitological and clinical parameters in highly predictable and significant ways, including prevention of death. In addition, examination of the extensively infected gut provided an important insight into the dynamics between a specific drug treatment, its impact on the extent and the site of parasite distribution, and clinical outcome. These uniform symptoms of weight loss, wasting, and death are powerful new parameters which bring this model closer to the actual disease seen in humans and other susceptible mammalian species.

TI  - Renal transplantation in children with posterior urethral valves revisited: a 10-year followup.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Renal transplantation is safe and effective for end stage renal disease in children with posterior urethral valves. We previously reported our 5-year post-transplantation results in boys with posterior urethral valves and matched controls. Graft survival was similar. However, we were concerned about elevated serum creatinine and the potential detrimental effects of hostile bladder dynamics in these children. We performed this study to determine whether our concern would be substantiated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records and computerized transplantation database in 268 boys younger than 19 years who underwent renal transplantation from May 1968 through November 1988. The 18 children with posterior urethral valves were compared to a nonobstructed cohort of 18 boys in regard to age, number of transplants, donor type and immunosuppression. All children had at least 10 years of followup (range 10 to 19). RESULTS: The 10-year post-transplant patient survival in the posterior urethral valves and control groups was 94 and 100%, while 10-year graft survival was 54 and 41%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in graft survival when comparing immunosuppression type, donor source and pre-transplant proximal urinary diversion. The 10-year mean serum creatinine was 2.3 and 2.0 mg./dl. in the posterior urethral valve and control groups, respectively (not statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: Our renal transplantation results in children with posterior urethral valves are comparable to those in children with nonobstructive end stage renal disease. The 10-year graft survival was better but not statistically significant in the posterior urethral valve group, while serum creatinine was similar. Our concern regarding renal transplantation in children with posterior urethral valves was not substantiated.

TI  - Low-dose narrow-band UVB phototherapy combined with topical therapy is effective in psoriasis and does not inhibit systemic T-cell activation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease which can be treated with topical medication, phototherapy or systemic medication. A subgroup of psoriatic patients does not respond to monotherapy and needs combination therapy. We used low-dose narrow-band UVB phototherapy, combined with balneotherapy, short-contact anthralin, liquor carbonis detergens and calcipotriol for treatment of psoriatic patients in our day care centre. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the efficacy, induction of erythema and effect on systemic T-cell activation of this combination therapy. METHODS: Skin reflectance spectrophotometry was used to measure skin erythema. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was used to evaluate psoriatic patients. Serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2-R) levels were measured by an ELISA. RESULTS: The possible erythematogenic effect of low-dose narrow-band UVB irradiation was studied (skin reflectance spectrophotometer) in a control group of psoriatic patients (n = 11). No induction of skin erythema was seen. Subsequently, this low-dose irradiation regimen was used in combination with topical medication in 26 psoriatic patients. A 90% decrease in the PASI was seen after a mean number of 35 treatment sessions. Seventeen patients (65%) remained in remission during the following 6 months. Serum sIL-2R levels were elevated in all patients (mean 913 U/ml) and did not change during treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that low-dose narrow-band UVB can be used successfully, in combination with topical treatment, in a day care setting to treat psoriatic patients. Since sIL-2R serum levels were not decreased, it can be speculated that this treatment does not induce systemic immunosuppression.

TI  - Health-related quality of life and symptom frequency before and after lung transplantation.  
AB  - Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom frequency and severity were assessed in 17 lung transplant recipients both prior to and following the procedure. Using standardized assessment techniques we found that the following components of QOL significantly improved post-transplantation: physical functioning, general health, vitality and social functioning. Both prior to and following transplantation, lung transplant recipients had significantly lower scores on all health-related quality of life indices when compared with a normative sample. Perhaps as a consequence of immunosuppression medication, recipients reported increased frequency of symptomatology following the procedure; however, considered together the symptoms were not reported as significantly more problematic following transplantation. These findings document improved HRQOL for lung transplant recipients and provide useful information for patients considering this potentially life-saving treatment option.

TI  - Sirolimus in transplantation.  
AB  - Although sirolimus (SRL) alone was very effective in rodents and pigs, it produced toxic side effects in dogs. Low doses of SRL combined with cyclosporine/brequinar (CsA/BQR) combinations achieved potent immunosuppression in the CsA-resistant mouse model. Similarly, SRL/CsA/BQR therapy protected kidney allografts from rejection in dogs without producing toxic side effects. In the CsA-sensitive rat model SRL/CsA combinations produced a potent synergistic interaction. In addition, recent clinical trials document the beneficial effects of low SRL doses in human kidney transplant recipients. Sirolimus, when combined with standard immunosuppressive therapy, remarkably reduces the incidence of acute rejection and permits individual drug dose reduction.

TI  - Flow cytometric analysis of chimerism in the rat tolerant to a renal allograft.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chimerism, produced by the two-way migration of cells between graft and host, is a proposed mechanism by which tolerance occurs. The appearance of donor/recipient chimeras in tolerant ACI to Lewis rat heterotopic renal transplants was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes using flow cytometry after staining with monoclonal antibodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ACI and Lewis rats were used as donor and recipient, respectively, after Rapamycin and Cyclosporin immunosuppression with or without donor blood or bone marrow transfusion. ACI and Lewis animals were also used for isograft and single-kidney controls. Animals were sacrificed at various time points after initial operation. Flow cytometry was performed on isolated peripheral blood leukocytes at sacrifice. Histologic and functional data were also obtained. The monoclonal antibody panel included RT1(a) (ACI, MHC I) combined with CD2, CD4, CD8, CD16, and CD25 or RT1(a,c) (bone marrow chimeras). RESULTS: RT1(a)+, CD8+ cells were transiently present in the peripheral blood leukocytes of Lewis recipients with the exception of allogeneic bone marrow recipients. No significant number of RT1(a)+, CD16+ ("dendritic" cell-line) chimeras was seen. Veto cells (RT1(a,c)+) were transiently present in the bone marrow recipients, but they did not lead to improved outcome. Furthermore, no correlation was made between histologic tolerance and any of these donor-derived cells. CONCLUSION: Donor/recipient chimerism, and the veto cell phenomenon are not operational tolerance mechanisms in this stringent model of ACI to Lewis rat renal transplantation.
