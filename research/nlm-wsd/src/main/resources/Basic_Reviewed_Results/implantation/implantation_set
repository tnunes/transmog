TI  - One balloon approach for optimized Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation: the MUSCAT trial [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: After stent deployment, larger balloons are frequently needed to optimize stent expansion according to angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) criteria. The objective of this trial was to assess the feasibility and safety of a single-balloon approach for predilation, stent implantation, and optimization with a differential-compliant balloon allowing for focal overexpansion. We also evaluated the achieved degree of stent expansion according to IVUS criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with 50 lesions received single or multiple Palmaz-Schatz coronary stents. The final angiographic diameter stenosis was -2.6 +/- 12.6% (reference diameter, 2.89 +/- 0.44 mm), and the residual lumen area stenosis (IVUS) was 13.0 +/- 12.3% (reference area 10.8 +/- 3.0 mm2). This result was achieved in two steps (first angiographic, then IVUS-guided stent optimization). The balloon inflation pressure increased from 13.1 +/- 3.0 bar at step 1 to 16.1 +/- 3.0 bar at step 2, which resulted in a balloon to artery ratio of 0.97 +/- 0.12 and 1.10 +/- 0.15, respectively, at the low-compliant peripheral balloon segments. The more compliant central balloon segments showed a balloon to artery ratio of 1.09 +/- 0.17 and 1.28 +/- 0.17, respectively. The primary success rate for stent deployment was 94%. Acute complications included two type A and one type B dissection without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The single-balloon approach for stenting is feasible and safe. The acute result is comparable to that of other studies with IVUS-guided stent optimization, the primary success rate, however, is slightly lower with the presently available catheter.

TI  - Expression of betacellulin and epiregulin genes in the mouse uterus temporally by the blastocyst solely at the site of its apposition is coincident with the "window" of implantation.  
AB  - In the mouse, the process of implantation is initiated by the attachment reaction between the blastocyst trophectoderm and uterine luminal epithelium that occurs at 2200-2300 h on day 4 (day 1 = vaginal plug) of pregnancy. Several members of the EGF family are considered important in embryo-uterine interactions during implantation. This investigation demonstrates that the expression of two additions to the family, betacellulin and epiregulin, are exquisitely restricted to the mouse uterine luminal epithelium and underlying stroma adjacent to the implanting blastocyst. These genes are not expressed during progesterone-maintained delayed implantation, but are rapidly switched on in the uterus surrounding the implanting blastocyst following termination of the delay by estrogen. These results provide evidence that expression of betacellulin and epiregulin in the uterus requires the presence of an active blastocyst and suggest an involvement of these growth factors in the process of implantation.

TI  - Retrievable patent ductus arteriosus plug for interventional, transvenous occlusion of the patent ductus arteriosus. Evaluation in lambs and preliminary clinical results.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The clinically most widely used devices (Porstmann-plug, Rashkind-umbrella, Botallooccluder) have inherent specific limitations (eg, transarterial approach, residual shunts, limited retrieval). The authors assess practicability, efficacy, and tissue reaction of the new retrievable transvenous plug device for the occlusion of the persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). METHODS: A foam plug (polyvinyl alcohol) is mounted on a titanium core pin where, at both ends, small legs (titanium nickel alloy) with titanium heads are anchored, to ensure safe fixation in the ductus. The device is introduced transvenously through a long sheath (Mullins sheath) and held by a modified biopsy forceps allowing complete retrieval until final release. A common lamb model of large PDAs (n = 11) was used to test for practicability and the histomorphologic outcome. Clinical results were obtained from a consecutive series of 16 patients (aged 13 to 71 years). RESULTS: In all lambs, placement of the plug within the PDA was possible. Histopathology (follow-up 10 to 215 days; mean 112 days) revealed an adequate ingrowing of the device and no pathologic foreign body reaction. The diameter of the human PDAs ranged from 3 to 7 mm (mean 5 mm). The size of the sheath used for introducing the plug (diameter 8 to 16 mm) ranged from 8 to 16 French. Fourteen of 16 PDAs were closed immediately after or on day 1 after implantation, 1 was closed after the 12-month follow-up, and 1 needed an additional plug after 30 months for definitive closure. CONCLUSIONS: The device demonstrated practicability and biocompatibility in our experimental lamb model and effectively closed the PDA in a consecutive series of 16 patients. A greater number of patients and a longer follow-up period are necessary for the definitive clinical assessment of the new device.

TI  - Single pass lead VDD pacing in children and adolescents.  
AB  - Implantation of permanent pacemakers in children and adolescents is possible but usually is limited to single chamber generators. The natural growth of these patients may require physiological pacing, but until recently two leads were required for this type of pacing. The single pass lead VDD pacing mode makes possible physiological pacing by using only one lead, for both atrial sensing and ventricular sensing and pacing. The feasibility of VDD pacing using endocardial lead was evaluated in 16 children and adolescents with congenital or postsurgical atrioventricular block. Their mean age was 7.9 +/- 4.9 years (range 1-16 years) and the smallest patient's weight was 8.2 kg. In all the patients, a single pass pacing lead with atrial sensing rings and bipolar ventricular pacing and sensing capability was implanted through the left or right subclavian vein. The pacemaker generator was implanted in a rectopectoral position. The mean atrial electrogram during the implantation was 4.2 +/- 2.1 mV and 2.6 +/- 1.9 mV after a mean of 1 week. The ventricular pacing threshold was 0.5 +/- 0.2 V; the ventricular pacing impedance was 560 +/- 95 omega; and the ventricular electrogram amplitude was 9.9 +/- 2.1 mV. This is a first report to demonstrate the feasibility of atrial synchronous ventricular endocardial pacing using a single pass lead in a relatively large group of children and adolescents.

TI  - Expression of laminin chain-specific gene transcripts in mouse uterine tissues during peri-implantation period.  
AB  - Laminin may be involved in uterine re-organization and embryo attachment to the uterine wall during the peri-implantation period. In the present study using a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the precise expression patterns of laminin chain (A, B1, and B2)-specific mRNAs were examined in mouse uterine tissues during the peri-implantation period. Although Northern blot hybridization failed to detect laminin A chain mRNA in mouse uterus, RT-PCR analysis showed that laminin A chain mRNA was present even at the lower level compared with B1 and B2 chain mRNA levels. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that approximately 3 x 10(6), 3.6 x 10(7), and 4 x 10(8) copies of A, B1, and B2 chain mRNA transcripts were present in 1 microgram of total RNA isolated from the uterus. During pregnancy, the A chain mRNA level was significantly increased only from day 6 after post-hCG when embryo attachment and decidualization started. Elevated level of A chain mRNA was sustained thereafter. Laminin A chain mRNA synthesized at this period was mainly originated from stroma decidual cells. The discrete elevation of laminin A chain mRNA level was also observed after estrogen stimulation in the delayed implantation model. Estrogenic stimulation to ovariectomized, progesterone-treated pregnant mice resulted in about a three-fold increase of laminin A chain mRNA levels. In contrast to A chain mRNA, both B1 and B2 chain mRNA levels were insignificantly altered during the peri-implantation period and delayed implantation by an estrogenic stimulation. Taken together, our results for the first time demonstrate that: (1) laminin A chain mRNA as well as B chain mRNAs is expressed in mouse uterus, (2) its mRNA level is significantly increased along with implantation process, and (3) ovarian steroids, especially estrogen, are likely to be involved in the regulation of laminin gene expression in the uterus.

TI  - Use of the artificial urinary sphincter in men and women.  
AB  - There are numerous therapeutic options for treating incontinence. Implantation of an artificial genitourinary sphincter is an excellent choice in cases of incontinence due to sphincteric dysfunction. In this article we report the Mayo Clinic data from several large series and compare these data to other recent reviews. In addition, we review current recommendations regarding patient selection and evaluation. There were 458 patients who underwent implantation of an artificial sphincter, including 417 men and 41 women. The overall continence rate was 88.2%, the reoperation rate was 23.1%, and the mechanical reliability was 88%. Satisfaction rates were greater than 90%. We conclude that artificial sphincter implantation is safe, reliable and very effective in treating incontinence due to sphincteric dysfunction in properly selected patients.

TI  - Nitric oxide inhalation in the treatment of right ventricular dysfunction following left ventricular assist device implantation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in end-stage heart failure, the management of right ventricular dysfunction presents a therapeutic problem unresolved by conventional drug therapy (catecholamines, nitrates, and prostacyclin). This study was performed to investigate the effects of supplemental inhalation of nitric oxide (NO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, postoperatively and prospectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intraindividual dose titration of NO was performed (0 to 40 ppm) according to a standardized protocol. Thereafter treatment was continued with the individually most effective dose of NO (25 to 40 ppm). In 8 consecutive male patients presenting with right ventricular dysfunction postoperatively, a significant dose-dependent improvement in hemodynamic function was observed: pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 336+/-110 to 210+/-59 dynes x s x cm(-5) (P<.0001), cardiac index rose from 2.0+/-0.4 to 2.7+/-0.4 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (P<.003) at 40 ppm; doses of >20 ppm were effective in increasing cardiac index (P<.05). With continuous NO inhalation up to 48 hours, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased further to 155+/-33 dynes x s x cm(-5) (P<.0001) as the cardiac index increased to 3.3+/-0.6 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (P<.003). Pulmonary artery pressure decreased (P<.0001) as did systemic vascular resistance with hemodynamic improvement (P<.01). Central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Right ventricular ejection fraction at transesophageal echocardiography increased from 24+/-7% to 44+/-7% (P<.01) at the end of the study, and right ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased (P<.05). Weaning from NO therapy was successful at 2 to 8 days, and all patients were extubated. Right ventricular function remained stable thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of right ventricular dysfunction following LVAD implantation, inhalation of NO markedly decreased right ventricular afterload by its selective vasodilating effects on the pulmonary circulation without producing systemic hypotension; this merits further evaluation.

TI  - [Temporary and permanent pacemaker provision in persistent left superior vena cava and atresia of the right superior vena cava (comment)]  
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: An 80-year-old woman was admitted because of confusion episodes, difficulty of finding words and transitory clouding of consciousness on that day. There were moderately moist rales over both lung bases and mild pretibial oedema. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of 30/min.  Attempted emergency implantation of a pacemaker electrode via the right subclavian vein failed because the catheter could not be advanced in the usual manner due to complete obstruction of unknown cause. INVESTIGATIONS: Fluoroscopy and venography of the upper great veins demonstrated a persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC), connecting to an aneurysmally enlarged coronary sinus (CS), as well as atresia of the right SVC (RSVC). TREATMENT AND COURSE: A temporary pacemaker was introduced transfemorally, subsequently replaced electively by a permanent one-chamber pacemaker system, the electrode wire having been introduced via the left cephalic vein--left SVC--CS, with its tip positioned in the right ventricle. CONCLUSION: If emergency placement of a pacemaker electrode proves impossible via the usual route because of a persistent LSVC and RSVC atresia, a transfemoral route should be used for temporary pacing. Permanent placement can usually be accomplished subsequently without much problem via the LSVC and coronary sinus.

AB  - We reported two male and one female patient (17, 36 and 47 years old, respectively) who presented infectious endocarditis (IE) in association with ventricular septal defect (VSD). In all cases, surgical treatment was performed in the acute stage of IE for persistent sepsis, pulmonary embolisms, and for giant vegetations. Because the tricuspid valve apparatus was severely damaged, valve replacement with the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprosthesis was done and small VSD was directly closed in all cases. In one case, a complete heart block occurred, which necessitated postoperative implantation of a permanent pacemaker. All patients recovered and resumed their original social activities without the relapse of endocarditis.

TI  - Reproductive efficiency in mink (Mustela vison) treated with the pesticides lindane, carbofuran and pentachlorophenol.  
AB  - Mink are carnivores of agroforestry fringe habitats and are exposed to pesticides that biomagnify within the food chain. Some pesticides are thought to disrupt reproductive and endocrine functions. In Expt 1, four groups of mink (n = 10) were fed either a control diet, or diets treated with lindane (1 mg kg-1 day-1), carbofuran (0.05 mg kg-1 day-1) or pentachlorophenol (1 mg kg-1 day-1) from before breeding until weaning. Mink were mated twice, at 7-8 day intervals. The treatments had no effect on the proportion of mink accepting the first mating; however, lindane and pentachlorophenol caused a decrease in the percentage of females accepting the second mating. Lindane and pentachlorophenol caused a decrease in whelping rate, although litter size was not affected. Carbofuran had no effect on fertility. Mink that mated only once had a lower whelping rate than mink that mated twice; therefore, it could not be determined whether the decreased whelping rates were due to the lack of a second mating or to increased embryo loss. In Expt 2, two groups of mink (n = 15) were fed a control diet or a diet treated with lindane (1 mg kg-1 day-1) from before mating until weaning. Mink were mated twice on two consecutive days. Lindane did not affect mating response at either mating. Whelping rate, but not implantation rate, was decreased by the lindane treatment. The proportion of embryos lost after implantation (implantation scars not represented by kits at whelping) was increased by the lindane treatment. In conclusion, both lindane and pentachlorophenol decreased fertility in mink, and the lindane effect was primarily a result of embryo mortality after implantation.

TI  - The effect of adjunctive mitomycin C in Molteno implant surgery.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of adjunctive intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) in Molteno drainage device implantation for patients with recalcitrant glaucomas. METHOD: Forty-nine eyes of 49 patients who underwent one-stage, single-plate Molteno device implantation with adjunctive intraoperative MMC (0.5 mg/ml) for 3 to 5 minutes (MMC group) were compared to a historic control group of 51 eyes of 51 patients (control group) who received one-stage, single-plate Molteno device implantation without MMC. Success (survival) was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 21 mmHg, inclusive, with (qualified success) or without (complete success) glaucoma medications and with no additional glaucoma surgery, phthisis, implant removal, or loss of light perception. RESULTS: Preoperative conditions were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in surgical survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.13, log-rank test). There also were no significant differences in the postoperative IOP levels and numbers of antiglaucoma medications between the two groups at all times (P > 0.05). Visual acuity was improved or remained within one line of preoperative visual acuity in 76.1% of the MMC group and 78.7% of the control group at 1 year after surgery (P = 0.76, chi-square test). Complications and reoperation for complications were similar in both groups (P > 0.05, chi-square test) except for the incidence of early postoperative hypotony and the total number of eyes with complications not requiring reoperation, which were more common in the MMC group (P = 0.027, 0.005, respectively, chi-square test). The most common complications included hypotony with or without a flat anterior chamber or choroidal detachment, followed by hyphema and tube plugging. CONCLUSION: Molteno device implantation with adjunctive intraoperative MMC in patients with complicated glaucoma may not offer a better chance of surgical success compared with Molteno implantation without MMC.

TI  - The history of interstitial brachytherapy of prostatic cancer.  
AB  - The history of interstitial brachytherapy of the prostate began in 1917 when Barringer inserted radium needles transperineally into the prostate, guided by a finger in the rectum. In 1952, Flocks et al. injected radioactive gold solution in prostatic cancer during open operation. In 1972, Whitmore et al. described retropubic Iodine-125 seed implantation through an open operation with pelvic lymph node dissection. The basis for ultrasound (US)-guided seed implantation was established in the late 1960s by Kratochwil's description of the first puncture transducer for one-dimensional US-guidance and Watanabe's pioneer work in prostatic screening. Our group performed the first punctures guided by static two-dimensional ultrasonic scanning (1969) and by dynamic ultrasound scanning (1974). During the 1970s, US-guided biopsies of almost all abdominal organs were performed and, in 1981, we introduced US-guided seed implantation of abdominal tumors and developed a technique for precise needle placement in the prostate guided by transrectal ultrasound. This was followed in 1983 by a technique for seed implantation guided by transrectal (transverse) ultrasonic scanning. That same year, Fornage described prostatic biopsy guided by transrectal longitudinal scanning. In 1990, we developed the seed implantation technique further by combining transverse and longitudinal scannings. In the late 1980s, Ragde from Seattle transferred the technique to the U.S., and since then, Ragde, Blasko, and others have treated numerous patients, refined the technique, taught many courses, and published extensively. They have obtained very promising prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based results which compare favorably with radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation in the treatment of prostatic cancer.

TI  - Reduction of polyethylene in a congruent meniscal knee prosthesis. Experimental and clinical studies.  
AB  - Polyethylene wear was assessed in the Rotaglide congruent meniscal bearing total knee prosthesis and a partial congruent total knee prosthesis with fixed bearing polyethylene tibial platform and a posterior stabilizer mechanism. A special wear test rig was used to test the 2 prostheses under compression load of 2960 N/mm2 (about 4 times the average body weight) and continuous 0 degree-70 degrees flexion-extension motion at the rate of 1 cycle per second. The most remarkable finding was the lack of measurable wear on the Rotaglide meniscal bearing up to 3.5 million cycles, while the other prosthesis began to show wear from the first million cycles and progressed to 0.38 mm at about 3.5 million cycles. At 11 million cycles (about 20 years of life), the Rotaglide showed penetration wear of 0.35 mm compared to 2.1 mm in the other prosthesis. In 7 meniscal bearings, retrieved either at postmortem (2) or at reoperation (5), no measurable penetration wear was observed after 3 years of implantation. Only 1 prosthesis obtained 5 years after implantation showed 0.23 mm penetration wear or about 0.05 mm per year. These findings strongly suggest that the use of congruent meniscal bearing prosthesis can reduce the polyethylene wear in total knee replacement.

TI  - Reproducibility of ventricular fibrillation characteristics in patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate reproducibility of local electrogram characteristics recorded during repeated episodes of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Power spectral analysis (using a fast Fourier transform algorithm) of electrograms recorded during 3 seconds of VF were analyzed in 24 patients undergoing ICD implantation using a Medtronic Transvene lead. Patients had 2 to 7 episodes of VF that were induced during defibrillation threshold testing. VF was induced by burst pacing (n = 20) or T wave shock (n = 4). Simultaneous electrograms during VF were recorded from a Medtronic Transvene lead with the following configurations: (1) a narrow spaced (12 mm) dedicated bipole used clinically for sensing; (2) a unipolar electrogram from the right ventricular coil; and (3) a widely spaced (18.3 mm) integrated bipole using the distal tip and the coil. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined to examine the reproducibility of these VF characteristics among VF episodes in each patient. Recordings from both bipolar configurations had ICCs from 0.40 to 0.55, whereas unipolar recordings ICCs were below 0.40. Reproducibility was similar for dedicated and integrated recordings. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency characteristics of repeated episodes of VF induced in the same subjects show fair-to-good but not excellent reproducibility. Bipolar recordings were far more reproducible than unipolar recordings, but both bipolar configurations had similar reproducibility. These findings have implications for both the pathophysiology of induced VF and the design of VF detection algorithms.

TI  - Role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in repairing of bone defects.  
AB  - TGF-beta is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates many aspects of cellular function, including periosteal mesenchymal cell proliferation, differentiation. This experiment is to study its effects on bone defect repair. A rabbit radial bone defect model was used to evaluate the effect of TGF-beta, which was extracted and purified from bovine blood platelets, on the healing of a large segmental osteoperiosteal defect. A 1.5-centimeter segmental defect was created in the mid-upper part of the radial shaft of adult rabbits. The defect was filled with implant containing TGF-beta that consisted of carrier and bovine TGF-beta. Limbs served as controls received carrier alone. The defects were examined radiographically and histologically at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after implantation. The results showed that in TGF-beta implant group, the defect areas at 12 weeks post operation were bridged by uniform new bone and the cut ends of cortex could not be seen; while in control group, the defects remained clear. Only a small amount of new bone formed as a cap on the cut bone ends. In the experimental group, new lamellar and woven bone formed in continuity with the cut ends of the cortex. An early medullar canal appears to be forming and contained normal-appearancing marrow elements; while the control group displayed entirely fibrous tissue within the defect site. Remnants of the cancellous bone carrier were observed in the control specimen. These data demonstrate that exogenous TGF-beta initiate osteogenesis and stimulate the bone defects repair in animal model.

TI  - [Myocardial revascularization for sudden cardiac death in patients after previous coronary angioplasty]  
AB  - PTCA was introduced into our hospital in June 1991. Since then till the end of 1996 emergency CABG operations were performed in fourteen patients. They were indicated because of acute myocardial ischaemia and hemodynamic deterioration that was the result of the dissection and occlusion of a coronary artery during angioplasty. There were 11 male and 3 female patients in this group aged 34 to 65 average 50 years. Twenty-three grafts were performed in total (18 saphenous, 5 using internal mammary artery), that is 1.6 graft per patient. A female patient died of myocardial infarction on the first postoperative day. All other patients survived and are under outpatient clinic's care. Over the analysed 6 years' period of time 1079 PTCAs were performed. The low rate of the unsuccessful procedures (1.3%) that required the emergency CABG is noteworthy. Since 1995, when the implantation of stents was introduced into our hospital, there were only 2 such procedures (0.4% of all PTCAs). Conclusions: The CABG operation performed shortly after a dissection and occlusion of the coronary artery underwent angioplasty usually prevents myocardial infarction and saves the patient's live. The introduction of implantation of the stents significantly diminished a number of patients who required an emergency CABG operation.

TI  - Baseline characteristics of patients in the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) Patch Trial.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery frequently have late sudden cardiac death. The CABG Patch Trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that randomized patients at high risk at the completion of CABG surgery to implantation of an epicardial implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or to no antiarrhythmic treatment. The trial was designed to determine whether prophylactic implantation of an ICD at the time of CABG surgery would result in a lower total mortality in long-term follow-up. METHODS: Patients undergoing CABG surgery were eligible for the trial if they were younger than 80 years, had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.36, and had an abnormal signal averaged electrocardiogram. Patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were excluded from the trial. All patients were scheduled to undergo follow-up at 3-month intervals until 42 months after surgery. RESULTS: Randomization of patients in the trial ended in February 1996. During the recruitment period 71,855 patients were screened, 1,422 were eligible, 1,055 were enrolled (signed consent forms), and 900 patients (76% of eligible patients) were randomized. The mean age of the 446 patients in the ICD group was 64 years versus 63 years for the 454 patients in the control group. A total of 87% of the participants in the ICD group were men versus 82% in the control group (p = NS). Most of the patients had a history of hypertension (55%), smoking (78%), and hypercholesterolemia (54%). Half of the patients had clinical heart failure, and the mean ejection fraction for both patient groups was 0.27 +/- 0.06. No difference was seen in the history of myocardial infarction (83%), congestive heart failure (50%), or atrial (11%) or ventricular (17%) arrhythmias between the two groups. Major clinical characteristics (age, sex, number of previous infarctions, incidence of heart failure, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction) were almost identical to those found in another ICD primary prevention trial, the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT). CONCLUSIONS: A high risk sample of patients was enrolled in The CABG Patch Trial, as shown by examination of their baseline characteristics.

TI  - Radiofrequency catheter ablation of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia: long-term success and the significance of inducible nonclinical arrhythmias.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is effective therapy for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients without structural heart disease. In patients with postinfarction VT; however, this procedure has been used predominantly as adjunctive therapy, targeting only the patient's clinically documented arrhythmia. By targeting all inducible, sustained VT morphologies, we sought to determine the utility of RF catheter ablation as a primary cure in patients who present with hemodynamically tolerated VT. METHODS AND RESULTS: RF ablation was attempted in 35 patients with a previous myocardial infarction and recurrent, hemodynamically tolerated VT. A mean of 3.9+/-2.7 VTs were induced per patient (range, 1 to 10). The clinically documented arrhythmia was successfully ablated in 30 of 35 patients (86%), and on follow-up electrophysiological testing, 11 patients had no inducible VT and were discharged without other therapy. Nineteen patients had inducible "nonclinical" arrhythmias on follow-up testing, and the majority underwent cardiac defibrillator implantation. Freedom from recurrent arrhythmias, including sudden death, was 91% in patients without inducible VT and 53% in patients with persistently inducible "nonclinical" arrhythmias (P<.05; mean follow-up, 17+/-12 and 12+/-11 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with well-tolerated VT, RF catheter ablation may be useful as a primary cure if no other ventricular arrhythmias are inducible on follow-up testing. Ablation of all hemodynamically tolerated arrhythmias should be attempted in patients with multiple inducible VT morphologies because of the high rate of recurrence of unablated VTs in these patients.

TI  - Tumor cell implantation after colonoscopy with biopsies in a patient with rectal cancer: report of a case.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Colonoscopy with biopsy(ies) is performed in patients with colorectal cancer for diagnosis and screening of synchronous lesions. There is some fear of spreading the disease related to implantation of tumor cells at sites of mucosal damage or to hematogenous or lymphatic spread as a result of tumor manipulation. METHODS: A total colonoscopy including biopsies, performed in a patient because of anal blood loss and tenesmus, revealed a circular, polypoid, ulcerated mass from 1.5 to 12 cm above the anal verge. After preoperative radiotherapy, the patient was subjected to surgical intervention. RESULTS: Histopathology revealed a poorly differentiated rectum adenocarcinoma, staged pT4N1Mx. At approximately 12 cm proximally from the tumor, a biopsy taken through a minute irregularity of the mucosa revealed some granulation tissue with adjacent normal colon mucosa. The basis of this granulation tissue, corresponding to submucosa, contained poorly differentiated tumor elements. CONCLUSIONS: This tiny lesion might have been caused by implantation of exfoliated cancer cells in a biopsy site. It may not be without risk to create excessive biopsy lesions in the presence of a manifestly malignant tumor because of the possibility of tumor cell implantation.

TI  - Progesterone and implanting blastocysts regulate Muc1 expression in rabbit uterine epithelium.  
AB  - Mammalian uteri are unreceptive to blastocyst implantation except during a relatively brief period. The transmembrane, cell surface mucin, Muc1, is present on epithelial cells of nonreceptive uteri in various species and has been demonstrated to have antiadhesive properties. These activities of Muc1 may prevent interaction of the embryonic trophoblast cells with the uterine epithelium. A previous study indicated that Muc1 expression in the rabbit, as in primates, is up-regulated by progesterone. This response would be expected to create a nonadhesive uterine surface during the progesterone-dominated receptive phase. In the current study, Northern blot analysis was used to evaluate Muc1 messenger RNA expression in the endometrium of estrous and progesterone-treated estrous rabbits and in endometrium from different stages of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy. Steady state levels of Muc1 messenger RNA were increased 10-fold when estrous animals were treated with progesterone for 5 days. Muc1 message was elevated 2- to 6-fold over estrous levels in endometrium of pseudopregnant females and 30-fold in preimplantation stage (6.75 days postcoitum) uteri. During implantation (7.25 day postcoitum), the high level of Muc1 expression continued in nonimplantation regions, but was dramatically reduced in endometrium from implantation sites. Using immunofluorescence localization, Muc1 protein was present on the apical surface of epithelial cells of estrous, pseudopregnant (4 and 6.75 days), preimplantation (6.75 days), and implantation (7.25 day) stage uteri. At the latter stage, luminal epithelium apposed to blastocysts had a marked reduction or absence of Muc1 immunostaining. Muc1-immunoreactive cells included luminal and cryptal epithelium in pregnant/pseudopregnant uteri, whereas the glandular cells stained weakly. Short term coculture of uterine epithelial cells with trophoblastic vesicles derived from 6.75-day blastocysts also resulted in a local reduction in apical epithelial Muc1 staining. These findings demonstrate that Muc1 expression is up-regulated by progesterone in the rabbit uterine epithelium and increases incrementally during pre- and periimplantation stages. Removal of Muc1 from the epithelial surface at implantation sites is accomplished locally via signals apparently produced by the blastocyst.

TI  - Role of foramen ovale electrodes in presurgical evaluation of intractable complex partial seizures.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The value of intracranial electrodes such as depth electrodes and subdural grids for intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in patients with intractable epilepsies has been well recognized. A new technique, foramen ovale electrode (FOE) implantation, was first introduced by Wieser in 1984 for the lateralization of bilateral mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) onset of seizures. METHODS: Since October 1993, a multipolar, three-contact FOE has been used in 12 intractable epileptic patients for presurgical evaluation. The reasons for FOE implantation included bilateral MTL onset of seizures recorded by extracranial EEGs in nine patients, and extracranial EEG abnormalities inconsistent with the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomogram (PET) or Wada test in three patients. Under general anesthesia, the FOEs were implanted according to the technique introduced by Kirschner, using Barters landmarks. RESULTS: After long-term telemetry recording with FOE, seven patients revealed clear onset of seizures originating from one side of the MTL and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Two patients had seizures of bilateral MTL onset. However, they received ATL due to predominantly unilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) and/or MRI and PET abnormalities. Seven (78%) of the nine operated patients became seizure-free after ATL. Three patients were considered not operable because two had multifocal onset of seizures and one had seizures with independent bilateral MTL onset. No serious complication resulted from implantation of FOE in this series. CONCLUSIONS: The semi-invasive technique of FOE is reliable for lateralization of bilateral MTL onset of seizures which are often not clearly recorded by extracranial EEGs. This procedure is safe and can be an alternative to invasive implantation of depth electrodes and subdural grids.

TI  - The design and validation of a novel intravenous microdialysis probe: application to fluconazole pharmacokinetics in the freely-moving rat model.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to design and validate a concentric, flexible intravenous microdialysis probe to determine drug concentrations in blood from the inferior vena cava of a freely-moving animal model. METHODS: An intravenous microdialysis probe was constructed using fused-silica tubing and an acrylonitrile/sodium methallyl sulfonate copolymer hollow fiber. The probe was tested in vitro for the recovery of fluconazole and UK-54,373, a fluconazole analog used for probe calibration by retrodialysis. Subsequent in vivo validation was done in rats (n = 7) that had a microdialysis probe inserted into the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein, and the femoral artery was cannulated for simultaneous blood sampling. Comparisons of fluconazole pharmacokinetic parameters resulting from the two sampling methods were performed at 2 and 10 days after probe implantation. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the microdialysis sampling and conventional blood sampling methods for the T1/2, Cl, Vdss, and dose-normalized AUC by paired t-test (p > 0.05) for repeated dosing at day 2 and day 10 after probe placement. The probe recovery, as determined by retrodialysis, significantly decreased over the ten day period. This finding indicates the necessity for frequent recovery determinations during a long-term blood microdialysis experiment. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that microdialysis sampling in the inferior vena cava using this unique and robust probe design provides an accurate method of determining blood pharmacokinetics in the freely-moving rat for extended experimental periods. The probe design allows for a simple surgical placement into the inferior vena cava which results in a more stable animal preparation for long-term sampling and repeated-measures experimental designs.

TI  - [Auto-dermal hernioplasty--a rare and unknown technique]  
AB  - The recurrence rates following the "simple" incisional hernia repair procedures (Mayo-procedure or direct adaptation) are unacceptably high, in literature up to 50%. In order to reduce the recurrence rates alternative procedures are necessary, e.g. the additional support of the anterior abdominal wall by implantation of a non resorbable mesh or autodermal plasty. Our national inquiry of 669 hospitals showed that the technique of autodermal hernioplasty is almost unknown among the German surgeons. In this article a comparison of the history, morphology, healing process and possibilities of cutis implantation as well as technical aspects of different types of autodermal hernioplasty (cutis lacing plasty, onlay and sublay corium mesh plasty) are described. By literature analysis the results of autodermal hernioplasty are compared with the results of mesh implantation. The autodermal hernioplasty is discussed as an alternative operative procedure to the implantation of artificial meshs.

TI  -  Implantation on the suture material and efficacy of povidone-iodine solution.  
AB  - Suture implantation of viable exfoliated tumour cells may be responsible for local recurrence of colorectal cancer. Using a colon cancer cell line, we obtained a suture implantation without intraperitoneal metastasis in about 80% of the control animals, when sacrificed on the 2nd postoperative week. The cytotoxic efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) was tested in vivo by a rat model with viable intracaecal tumour cells, and in vitro by trypan blue exclusion and the MTT assay. In vivo PVP-I at 5% significantly reduced the incidence of tumour growth, while the product at 2.5% had a significant effect in only the monofilament polypropylene group. In an in vitro toxicity study, PVP-I higher than 0.16% was effective at killing almost all tumour cells. PVP-I had effective cytotoxicity in vivo and in vitro, being less cytotoxic in vivo than in vitro.

TI  - Norgestomet implants prevent pregnancy in beef heifers on pasture.  
AB  - The efficacy of erodible norgestomet implants for preventing pregnancy in postpubertal heifers was evaluated in two experiments at five locations each. Heifers (n = 896) within each study location were stratified by weight and allotted randomly to receive an ear implant containing either 0, 24, 36, or 48 mg of norgestomet (d 0). Heifers were exposed to fertile bulls immediately after implantation for 75 d (d 0 to 74) in Exp. 1 (n = 476) or for 80 d (d 75 to 154) in Exp. 2 (n = 420). Weights were recorded on d 0 and 74 (Exp. 1 and 2) and d 154 (Exp. 2). Each heifer was palpated rectally for pregnancy at the end of each experiment. Pregnancy rates were higher (P < .01) for control heifers (0 mg implant) than for heifers that received 24, 36, or 48 mg of norgestomet. In Exp. 1, pregnancy rates were 96, 29, 6, and 4% for heifers that received 0, 24, 36, and 48 mg implants of norgestomet, respectively. In Exp. 2, pregnancy rates were 85, 36, 19, and 9% for heifers that received 0, 24, 36, and 48 mg implants of norgestomet, respectively. Estrous activity during the first 3 wk of bull exposure was reduced (P < .05) among heifers that received norgestomet implants compared to control heifers but was not completely abolished at any dosage in Exp. 1. During the first 75 d of Exp. 1 and 2, heifers treated with 36 or 48 mg norgestomet implants gained weight faster (P < .05) than control heifers. Combined across both experiments, ADG during the first 74 d were .53, .56, .59, and .60 kg/d for heifers treated with 0, 24, 36, and 48 mg implants of norgestomet, respectively. These data indicate that norgestomet implants increased rate of weight gain, reduced estrous activity, and reduced the occurrence of pregnancy in heifers on pasture.

TI  - Quality of life with an implanted left ventricular assist device.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for longer-term support of patients awaiting cardiac transplantation, we must now consider whether to use these devices as alternatives to medical therapy when biologic hearts are needed but not forthcoming. This expansion of use depends as much on quality of life as it does on survival. To draw an inference about long-term quality of life with implanted LVADs, we studied "bridged" patients at our institution. METHODS: We elicited, by standard gamble, the utilities (preferences) of bridged patients at three points in their care: before LVAD implantation, during LVAD support, and after cardiac transplantation. RESULTS: Utility was 0.548 (+/-0.276) before implantation, 0.809 (+/-0.136) during LVAD support, and 0.964 (+/-0.089) after transplantation. For patients interviewed during all three states of health, the utilities were significantly different (p = 0.0009 by analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life with an LVAD was substantially better than with medical therapy, on par with renal transplantation (as established by others), and not as good as after cardiac transplantation. These results portend an acceptable quality of life for long-term use of LVADs for patients with end-stage heart failure and contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting a clinical trial to test this new use.

TI  - Effect of cochlear implantation on nasality in post-lingually deafened adults.  
AB  - The present study addresses the effect of cochlear implantation on nasality in 21 post-lingually deafened Dutch subjects. All subjects received the Nucleus 22 implant (MSP version). Speech recordings were made pre-implantation and 3 and 12 months post-implantation with the implant switched on and off. Nasality measurements were performed on a standard text and on two sentences without nasal phonemes. The results show that post-lingual deafness in individuals can result in a deviant degree of nasality in speech production. However, the nasalance value of 86% of the subjects of our study fell within the normative range defined as the mean +/- 2 standard deviations of the normal population. After implantation we found no statistically significant effect of implant use. However, individual nasality values outside the normative range may improve. Furthermore, 12 months post-implantation we found a significant decrease in the variability of the nasalance values obtained for two sentences without nasal phonemes.

TI  - Bioactive glass fiber/polymeric composites bond to bone tissue.  
AB  - Bioactive glass fibers were investigated for use as a fixation vehicle between a low modulus, polymeric composite and bone tissue. In an initial pilot study, bioactive glass fiber/polysulfone composites and all-polysulfone control rods were implanted into the rabbit tibia; the study was subsequently expanded with implantation into the rabbit femur. Bone tissue exhibited direct contact with the glass fibers and adjacent polymer matrix and displayed a mechanical bond between the composite and bone tissue after six weeks implantation. Interfacial bond strengths after six weeks implantation averaged 12.4 MPa, significantly higher than those of the all-polymer controls. Failure sites for the composite at six weeks generally occurred in the bone tissue or composite, whereas the failure site for the polymer implants occurred exclusively at the implant/tissue interface. The bioactive glass fiber/polysulfone composite achieved fixation to bone tissue through a triple mechanism: a bond to the bioactive glass fiber, mechanical interlocking between the tissue and glass fibers, and close apposition and possible chemical bond between the portions of the polymer and bone tissue. This last mechanism resulted from an overspill of bioactivity reactions from the fibers onto the surface of the surrounding polymer which we call the "halo" effect.

TI  - Simultaneous use of mitomycin-C with Baerveldt implantation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of Baerveldt implantation with adjunctive mitomycin-C in cases of complicated glaucoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the charts of all patients who had undergone Baerveldt implantation with mitomycin-C between January 1993 and March 1995. Success was defined before data collection as an intraocular pressure (IOP) between 5 and 21 mm Hg, with or without medications. The success rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were identified. The mean preoperative IOP was 33.6 mm Hg, with an average of 2.0 antiglaucoma medications. The probability of success at 6 and 12 months for patients who received mitomycin-C during Baerveldt implantation was 82.4% and 73.3%, respectively. Choroidal effusion with a flat anterior chamber (10.3%), corneal edema (6.8%), and conjunctival erosion (6.8%) were the most frequent complications. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective series of complicated glaucoma, the implantation of a Baerveldt drainage device with adjunctive mitomycin-C had a satisfactory outcome. The complications encountered and the clinical efficacy were comparable to those of previously reported series in which mitomycin-C was not used.

TI  - Subcutaneous single-incision implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators under local anesthesia by electrophysiologists in the electrophysiology laboratory.  
AB  - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have traditionally been implanted at the operating room under general anesthesia. Endocardial lead systems and downsized devices allowed implantation by electrophysiologists in the pectoral region. The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous ICD implantation performed entirely by electrophysiologists using a single-incision approach for lead insertion and device placement under local anesthesia. Between June 1996 and May 1997, 51 of 52 consecutive patients (41 men and 10 women, mean age 58 +/- 9 years) underwent ICD implantation at the electrophysiology laboratory. Local anesthesia and intravenous sedation were administered to all patients. After transvenous lead positioning by either venotomy of the left cephalic vein (n = 16) or puncture of the left subclavian vein (n = 35), all ICDs were implanted subcutaneously at the left subclavicular region. Fifty procedures (98%) were successful at first attempt. The mean implantation time was 76 +/- 22 minutes and the mean fluoroscopy time was 7.5 +/- 5.2 minutes. Patients received ICD devices generating biphasic waveforms. The mean defibrillation threshold was 11 +/- 3 J. Procedure-related complications occurred in 5 patients (10%): 1 lead dislocation, 2 pocket hematomas, and 2 pneumothorax requiring drainage. Mean time from implantation to hospital discharge was 1.8 +/- 1.2 days. During follow-up (38 +/- 14 weeks), all devices were operating appropriately and no major complications occurred. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that a single-incision subcutaneous technique for ICD implantation can be safely and successfully performed by electrophysiologists using local anesthesia and intravenous sedation. The high success rate, low complication occurrence, and short implantation and fluoroscopy times make this cost-effective technique in the electrophysiology laboratory the method of choice.

TI  - Multicomponent gene therapy vaccines for lung cancer: effective eradication of established murine tumors in vivo with interleukin-7/herpes simplex thymidine kinase-transduced autologous tumor and ex vivo activated dendritic cells.  
AB  - Multiple antitumor modalities may be necessary to overcome lung tumor-mediated immunosuppression and effectively treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To evaluate a multimodality gene therapy approach for control of local tumor growth, a weakly immunogenic murine alveolar cell carcinoma, L1C2, was transduced with either the interleukin-7/hygromycin-herpes simplex thymidine kinase (IL-7/HyHSVtk) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) retroviral vector or a vector containing the HyHSVtk, but not the IL-7 gene. Of the many cytokines available for gene transfer, IL-7 was chosen for these studies because it both stimulates CTL responses and down-regulates tumor production of the immunosuppressive peptide TGF-beta. Following selection in hygromycin, IL-7 transduction was confirmed by ELISA. Clones produced 1.25 to 10 ng of IL-7/ml/10(6) cells per 24 h. In vitro, genetically modified tumor cells were significantly more sensitive to ganciclovir (GCV) than unmodified parental tumor cells. The in vivo growth of ex vivo modified L1C2 cells was evaluated. There was a dose-response relationship between the amount of IL-7 secreted in vitro and the growth of genetically modified murine tumor in vivo. Transduced tumor cells regressed in mice following GCV therapy. Although ex vivo gene modification of tumor cells led to complete resolution of the tumor following implantation in vivo, IL-7 and HSVtk gene modified tumor cells were not effective in treating established parental tumors. However when 5 x 10(5) bone marrow-derived, in vitro activated dendritic cells (DC) were administered in combination with transduced tumor and GCV, 5 day old established tumors were eradicated in 80% of mice. These studies suggest that multicomponent vaccines may facilitate improved host responses by replacing host immune deficits and thus could have a role in adjuvant therapy and local control of NSCLC.

TI  - The adverse effect of hydrosalpinges on in vitro fertilization pregnancy rates and the benefit of surgical correction.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that IVF-ET pregnancy rates (PRs) for patients with tubal factor infertility are decreased in patients with hydrosalpinges and that surgical correction reverses this effect. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Private practice IVF-ET program. PATIENT(S): Patients (n = 160) undergoing 238 cycles of IVF-ET were stratified into groups based on the presence of hydrosalpinges and whether surgical correction had been performed. Patients >39 years old and patients with male factor infertility were excluded from the study. INTERVENTION(S): Patients with hydrosalpinges were offered surgical correction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy defined by an intrauterine gestational sac. RESULT(S): Patients with hydrosalpinges had significantly decreased implantation rates and PRs per transfer (2.8% and 8.5%, respectively) than patients with tubal factor infertility but without hydrosalpinges (15.7% and 38.6%). Surgical correction improved implantation rates and PRs in patients with prior failed cycles (16.1% and 37.5%) and in patients undergoing surgery before IVF-ET (21.8% and 51.7%). The type of surgery performed did not affect success rates in the small number of patients evaluated. CONCLUSION(S): The presence of a hydrosalpinx during an IVF-ET cycle results in significant decreases in implantation rates and PRs. Surgical treatment of hydrosalpinges before IVF-ET cycles improves implantation rates and PRs.

TI  - Culture and transfer of human blastocysts increases implantation rates and reduces the need for multiple embryo transfers.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the transfer of blastocysts on day 5, developed in sequential culture media, resulted in an increase in implantation rate compared with embryos transferred on day 3. DESIGN: Comparative study of embryo culture regimes. SETTING: Private practice assisted reproductive technology center. PATIENT(S): Twenty-three patients undergoing routine IVF cycles. INTERVENTION(S): Culture of embryos to day 3 in either standard culture conditions or a serum-free chemically defined medium. One hundred one embryos were subsequently cultured from day 3 to day 5 in a second serum-free medium specifically designed to support development of the blastocyst. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryo cell number and quality on day 3. Blastocyst development on day 5.  Implantation rate (determined by fetal heart) and ongoing pregnancy rate (PR). RESULT(S): Implantation rates for embryos transferred at the blastocyst stage of development were twice that observed for embryos transferred on day 3, around the eight-cell stage. Significantly more embryos were required for transfer on day 3, compared with day 5, to establish similar PRs. CONCLUSION(S): Viable human blastocysts can be obtained in sequential culture media in the absence of coculture and serum. Transfer of blastocysts in IVF will facilitate high PRs while limiting the number of embryos transferred and therefore minimizes the risk of multiple gestation.

TI  - Catheterization treatment of stenosis and hypoplasia of pulmonary arteries.  
AB  - Stenosis of pulmonary arteries is one of the most challenging problems requiring treatment in the care of patients with congenital and acquired cardiopulmonary disease. Surgical approaches have been met with difficulty over the years, and may themselves lead to further distortion of the treated arteries. Balloon dilation first came into use in the 1980s, and has proved moderately effective. Its use has been extended to proximal pulmonary valve stenosis in order to improve distal flow and artery growth in some variants of tetralogy of Fallot. More recently, the judicious application of stent implantation has improved the outlook for pulmonary artery stenosis. The etiology, treatment (with balloon dilation and stent placement), and prognosis of pulmonary arterial stenosis will be discussed.

TI  - A study of reflux in patients with an ileal orthotopic bladder.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is vesico-ureteric reflux during voiding in patients who had undergone an ileal bladder substitution after cystectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 15 patients (13 men and two women) who had undergone radical cystectomy and construction of a Studer ileal neobladder. At 1-24 months (median 4) after the operation indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC) was performed after isotopic renography (using 99m-technetium mercapto-acetyltriglycine) and voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG). RESULTS: None of the patients had reflux during voiding, either on IRC or on VCUG. Renal function and morphology remained stable in all patients. Despite bacteriuria occurring in four patients, no episode of pyelonephritis was reported. CONCLUSION: There was no vesico-ureteric reflux during voiding in patients with a Studer ileal bladder substitution. However, long-term follow-up is needed to finally determine whether an antirefluxive ureteric implantation is required to protect the upper urinary tract in patients with ileal low-pressure bladder substitutions.

TI  - Changes in synthetic and natural vowel perception after specific training for congenitally deafened patients using a multichannel cochlear implant.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether the ability to use place-coded vowel formant information could be improved after training in a group of congenitally deafened patients, who showed limited speech perception ability after cochlear implant use ranging from 1 yr 8 mo to 6 yr 11 mo. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between electrode position difference limens and vowel recognition. DESIGN: Three children, one adolescent, and one young adult were assessed with synthesized versions of the words/hid, head, had, hud, hod, hood/containing three formants and with a natural version of these words as well as with a 12-alternative, closed-set task containing monosyllabic words. The change in performance during a nontraining period was compared to the change in performance after 10 training sessions. RESULTS: After training, two children showed significant gains on a number of tests and improvements were consistent with their electrode discrimination ability. Difference limens ranged from one to three electrodes for these patients as well as for two other patients who showed minimal to no improvements. The minimal gains shown by the final patient could be partly explained by poorer apical electrode position difference limen. CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains in vowel perception occurred post-training on several assessments for two of the children. This suggests the need for children to continue to have aural rehabilitation for a substantial period after implantation. Minimal improvements, however, occurred for the remaining patients. With the exception of one patient, their poorer performance was not associated with poorer electrode discrimination.

TI  - A European perspective on pediatric cochlear implantation, rehabilitation services, and their educational implications.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the educational implications of pediatric cochlear implantation from the perspective of the implant team. METHODS: Coordinators of pediatric cochlear implant teams throughout Europe took part in a survey using forced-choice questions. Fifty-four centers were originally sent the questionnaire; 41 centers replied. RESULTS: Of 504 children planned to receive cochlear implants in Europe during 1996, 54% (273/504) were aged 2-5 years and 12% (60/504) aged 0-2 years, indicating a trend toward pediatric implantation in younger children. There is a strong commitment to rehabilitation in the teams; 66% (27/41) employ a teacher of the deaf, the ratio of medical/audiological to rehabilitation personnel is 1:2, and 76% (31/41) of the implant teams visit local educators. Of all the children receiving implants to the date of this report, 23% were considered to be in unfavorable educational environments; these were environments where children were taught with an emphasis on sign language and little expectation from audition, and mainstream provision without support from experienced teachers of the deaf. CONCLUSION: There is a high staff input to children with cochlear implants from implant rehabilitation personnel over and above the input received in the educational environment. Hence, it is important for the school and the implant team to mutually agree on their shared responsibilities. Moreover, as the provision of service is variable and inconsistent, the development of guidelines for practice in each country should ensure consistency of rehabilitative and educational support to children with cochlear implants.

TI  - Choice, isolation, and preparation of cells for bioartificial vascular grafts.  
AB  - Preparation of cells and tissues for bioartificial vascular grafts is discussed from the viewpoint of tissue engineering. In general, a neointima is not formed on vascular prostheses except at the anastomotic sites. Graft surfaces do not heal and are covered with fresh thrombi for a long period of time after implantation. The delayed healing is, so to speak, an intractable ulcer of the vascular wall. To overcome this problem, we have developed a tissue fragment transplantation method. We consider that neointima formation of vascular prostheses after implantation is a product of tissue engineering in vivo. Therefore, 3 essential elements for tissue engineering, i.e., cells, extracellular matrices, and cytokines, are required for neointima formation. Synthetic vascular prostheses lack one or more of these elements. In this study we demonstrated a standard healing process of fabric vascular prostheses and an antithrombogenic polymer graft using animal models. Then we showed the tissue fragment transplantation method using venous tissues, adipose tissues, and bone marrow. This method provided the 3 essential elements to the prostheses. To allow these elements to be actively engaged in neointima formation, we treated cells and tissues as clumps without enzymatic digestion. We also took advantage of the in vivo environment. With the results we demonstrate our way of thinking in relation to bioartificial vascular grafts.

TI  - Effects of megakaryocyte growth and development factor on survival and retroviral transduction of T lymphoid progenitor cells.  
AB  - Murine retroviral vectors have the potential to mediate stable gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitor cells. A known drawback to the use of these vectors is that transduction can only take place in cells actively progressing through the cell cycle. Thrombopoietin, the c-mpl ligand, is known to support division of hematopoietic precursors of primitive origin. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF) is a polypeptide related to thrombopoietin that stimulates megakaryocyte production. To investigate whether MGDF would also induce stem cell division and support retroviral transduction of CD34+ cells, we compared the effects of MGDF, stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and IL-6, alone or in combination, using amphotropic and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) pseudotyped murine retroviral vectors. Similar transduction efficiency was observed when CD34+ cells were transduced in the presence of SCF and MGDF as compared to SCF, IL-3, and IL-6. Using the SCID-hu mouse model of thymopoiesis, we investigated whether CD34+ cells transduced in the presence of these cytokines could reconstitute irradiated thymic implants, and whether vector sequences were present in mature thymocytes. At early timepoints, no significant differences were observed on engraftment of donor progenitors incubated with each cytokine combination. However, a significant difference in the percentage of donor derived CD4+/CD8+ immature thymocytes was observed 9 weeks after implantation of CD34+ cells exposed to the combination of SCF and MGDF as compared to SCF, IL-3, and IL-6 (p = 0.04), indicating that MGDF/SCF better supported the survival of thymocyte precursor cells. Approximately 4% of thymocytes in both cytokine groups harbored vector sequences. These studies provide evidence that MGDF and SCF in combination can mediate transduction of hematopoietic progenitors capable of contributing to long-term thymopoiesis. These results may have important applications for the implementation of gene therapy strategies in disorders affecting the T lymphoid system.

TI  - Localization and characterization of porcine patellar tendon xenograft antigens in a rabbit model of medial collateral ligament replacement.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ligament injuries of the knee are common and, if severe, can predispose to joint pain, instability, reinjury, and, ultimately, osteoarthritis. Xenograft replacement of ligaments could have potential; however, a limited understanding of the immunology of ligament xenograft rejection has inhibited their use. The purpose of this study was to characterize the antigenic elements of a fresh porcine tendon xenograft in a rabbit model and to provide a better understanding of what would need to be done to either block or extract these antigenic elements. METHODS: Three experimental situations were evaluated in a pig to rabbit ligament transplantation model: subcutaneous implantation of fresh porcine patellar tendon (PPT), implantation of fresh PPT into a medial collateral ligament midsubstance gap, and replacement of the entire medial collateral ligament complex with either fresh or guanidinium hydrochloride-extracted PPT. Preimmune and immune sera were collected from rabbits and used to localize antigenic targets in PPT, meniscus, and cartilage with indirect immunofluorescence techniques. The reactivities of the same rabbit sera towards tissue extracts of PPT, meniscus, and cartilage by Western immunoblot analyses were used to characterize the antigenic components. RESULTS: Indirect immunofluorescence with preimmune rabbit sera on PPT showed staining of tendon fibroblasts. Immune sera from rabbits transplanted with xenografts stained regions of the extracellular matrix of PPT. Fresh PPT induced antibodies that consistently recognized six extracellular matrix components with molecular masses of >200 kDa, 180 kDa, 135 kDa, 108 kDa, 63 kDa, and 59 kDa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that naturally occurring rabbit anti-pig antibodies of the IgG isotype recognize immunogenic components on tendon fibroblasts, whereas induced rabbit anti-pig antibodies recognize a specific subset of six extracellular matrix components of PPT. PPT xenografts appeared to induce a similar humoral immune response irrespective of graft location. Finally, our results indicate that selective extraction of PPT xenograft components before implantation altered the induced rabbit anti-pig antibody response; however, such extraction did not change the ultimate fate of the transplant tissue.

TI  - [Primary treatment of left coronary artery diseases by percutaneous implantation of stents]  
AB  - Left main coronary artery (LM) stenting has only been reported in bail-out situations or absolute contraindications so surgery. The authors report the immediate and midterm results of primary Palmaz-Schatz stent implantation in two young patients without contraindication to surgery. The first patient, 58 year-old, was admitted for unstable angina in October 1994. Coronary angiography showed an isolated severe ostial lesion of the LM. After conferring with the surgical team which remained on stand-by, angioplasty and stent implantation were performed with excellent results, no complications and no restenosis on angiographic controls at 3 and 12 months. The patient remained asymptomatic 24 months later. The second patient, 38 year-old, was admitted in June 1995 for unstable angina, and coronary angiography showed a severe isolated stenosis in the middle of a long and wide LM. Primary coronary stenting was also performed with excellent results, no complication and no restenosis on angiographic controls at 4 and 8 months. This patient was still asymptomatic 16 months after stenting. These excellent immediate and medium-term results are encouraging and suggest that this form of treatment might be extended to patients with an isolated whether primary LM stent implantation could become a suitable alternative to surgery in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: The relationship between the number of replaced embryos and the outcome of IVF-ET in patients with hydrosalpinges was investigated in a retrospective, nonrandomized study performed at a governmental IVF center. METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing 161 IVF cycles ending in embryo transfer were studied. Previously diagnosed hydrosalpinges were evident on transvaginal sonography in 48 cycles in 26 patients (group I) and not evident in 15 cycles in 10 patients (group II). The control group included 98 cycles in 64 patients with tubal lesions other than hydrosalpinx. Pregnancy and implantation rates were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Replacement of three or fewer embryos was associated with significantly lower implantation rates in group I compared to controls. Despite the difference in the rank of IVF trial within the same group, significantly lower implantation rates were found when four or fewer embryos were replaced in the control group and not in group I. CONCLUSION: An increased number of replaced embryos counteracts the adverse effect of hydrosalpinges on IVF/ ET outcome.

TI  - In vivo dissolution behavior of various RF magnetron sputtered Ca-P coatings.  
AB  - Radiofrequency magnetron sputter deposition was used to deposit Ca-P sputter coatings on titanium discs, and these coatings were implanted subcutaneously into the backs of rabbits. Half of the as-sputtered coatings were subjected to additional heat treatment for 2 h at 500 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated that annealing at 500 degrees C changed the amorphous sputtered coating into an amorphous-crystalline apatite structure. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination of the sputtered coatings showed excellent coverage of the substrate surface. Annealing of the 4-microm-thick coatings resulted in the appearance of small cracks. SEM demonstrated that until 4 weeks of implantation, all heat-treated coatings were present and all amorphous coatings were completely or mostly dissolved. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the formation of carbonate apatite (CO3-AP) on these specimens. Furthermore, XRD analysis showed that these CO3-AP precipitated coatings disappeared after 8 weeks of implantation. On the other hand, SEM inspection of these specimens revealed that the 4-microm heat-treated coating was still partially maintained and that small Ca-P crystals were present on the titanium substrate. On the basis of these results, we conclude that apparently 0.1 microm heat-treated Ca-P sputter coating is of sufficient thicknesses to stimulate carbonate apatite deposition under in vivo conditions.

TI  - [Endovascular Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy for avoidance of intimal hyperplasia in peripheral vessels after PTA and stent implantation. A 6-year experience]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the "golden standard" in the therapy of vessel occlusions due to arteriosclerotic plaques. In spite of all improvements of the technique and the equipment with and without stent implantation there is still a restenosis rate of 40%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Endovascular brachytherapy with an iridium-192 HDR source was performed in cases of a restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia which occurred within 6 months after a former PTA. After PTA and stent implantation a 9-French ReKa catheter was positioned with the tip 2 cm below the stent. This catheter served a centering device and as a guide for the 5-French applicator. After determination of the isodose and individual planning a dose of 12 Gy to 3 mm source distance was applied. After this procedure the patient received heparin for 72 hours followed by marcumar. RESULTS: From May 1990 until June 1996 28 patients (21 male, 7 female) were treated after PTA and stent implantation with endovascular brachytherapy. All patients had clinical relevant restenosis or reocclusion of the arteria femoralis. The follow-up time ranges from 2 to 71 months. Twenty-seven patients had a reasonable follow-up time longer than 6 months. Twenty-five patients could be followed: 4 patients had no or only minimal flow in the treated area, 2 patients moved with an unknown address, 1 patient died without any follow-up examination. No side effects of the radiation appeared. CONCLUSION: Regarding the small number of patients endovascular brachytherapy with iridium 192 HDR seems to be a save and useful adjuvant treatment form to avoid intimal hyperplasia after PTA.

TI  - [Comparative studies of the rate of restenosis after implantation of Palmaz-Schatz and AVE-Micro stents]  
AB  - Late results of interventional procedures utilizing coronary stents are largely determined by the rate of restenosis. So far few data are available addressing the effect of stent design, implantation pressure and morphologic factors on this crucial variable. Therefore we analyzed the coronary angiograms obtained in 259 patients before, immediately after and at 3 to 6 months following stent implantation for obstructive coronary disease. A total of 196 AVE-Micro-Stents and 142 Palmaz-Schatz-Stents were implanted into 307 stenoses. In 126 stenoses there were implanted only Palmaz-Schatz-Stents, in 170 only AVE-Micro-Stents and in 11 stenoses there were implanted Palmaz-Schatz- as well as Micro-Stents. Restenosis was defined as an over 50% stenosis at follow up. No significant difference was detected with regard to global restenosis rate at an average of 4 months following implantation (Palmaz-Schatz 33%, Micro-Stent 27%). If results were analyzed according to implantation pressure however, there was a significantly lower restenosis rate for AVE-Micro-Stents implanted with > 10 atm (17%) as compared to < or = 10 atm (35%, p < 0.02) and as compared to Palmaz-Schatz-Stents (34%, p < 0.02), which were also implanted with high pressure over 10 atm. In addition to implantation pressure, vessel segment and morphology of stenosis proved to be important determinants of late results. In this series of patients the AVE-Micro-Stent compared favourably to the Palmaz-Schatz-Stent not only with respect to a significantly lower restenosis rate, when implanted with pressures > 10 atm, but also with regard to its superior flexibility and handling characteristics.

TI  - Type 2 cadherins in the human endometrium and placenta: their putative roles in human implantation and placentation.  
AB  - PROBLEM: The cadherins are a gene superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. To date, the role(s) of the cadherins in human implantation remains poorly defined. METHOD OF STUDY: The spatiotemporal expression of the type 2 cadherins, known as cadherin-11 and cadherin-6, in the endometrium and placenta was examined using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Cadherin-6 and cadherin-11 are differentially expressed in the endometrial stroma during the menstrual cycle. The switch between cadherin-6 and cadherin-11 expression in the endometrial stroma occurs during the late secretory phase. Maximum cadherin-11 mRNA levels were observed in the decidua of early pregnancy but were markedly reduced at term. In the placenta, cadherin-11 is expressed in the syncytial trophoblast and extravillous cytotrophoblast columns. However, cadherin-6 seems to be the predominant cadherin subtype present in highly invasive extravillous cytotrophoblasts. CONCLUSION: Cadherin-11 and cadherin-6 may play a central role in the formation and organization of the human endometrium and placenta.

TI  - L-arginine inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation of vein graft intimal thickness in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect of the chronic administration of L-arginine on intimal thickness and the kinetics of smooth muscle cell proliferation in autovein grafts in hypercholesterolemic rabbits were examined. METHODS: Male rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet (control group) and a 1% cholesterol diet supplemented by 2.25% L-arginine HCl in drinking water (arginine group). Each group underwent reversed autologous vein bypass grafting of the left common carotid artery using the left external jugular vein. At 2 or 4 weeks after operation, intimal cell proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and intimal thickness of the graft was measured with an ocular cytometer. At 4 weeks after operation, endothelium-dependent responses were examined by isometric tension recording. RESULTS: At 4 weeks after operation, the level of plasma arginine and citrulline are significantly higher in the arginine group (n = 7), compared with the control (n = 7). Intimal thickness in the arginine group (n = 7) was significantly reduced, compared with that of the control (n = 7). At 2 weeks after operation, the BrdU labeling index of the control (n = 5) was significantly higher than that of the arginine group (n = 5). At 4 weeks after operation, ACh caused endothelium-dependent relaxation in the arginine group (n = 4), while in the control (n = 4), ACh did not relax. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that smooth muscle cell proliferation of the rabbit jugular vein grafts during hypercholesterolemia occurs at an early stage after graft implantation, prior to the development of intimal thickness. Intimal thickness of vein graft during hypercholesterolemia was reduced by chronic administration of dietary L-arginine, by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation. The enhancement of NO production in the blood vessel wall may therefore be useful for preventing late graft failure.

TI  - [Comparison of peritoneal patch and vascular prosthesis monitored with isotopes and parameters of humoral and cell mediated response]  
AB  - The aim of this experimental study was to assess the reaction of peritoneal patch and vascular graft after implantation in arterial system. We compare complement haemolytic activation CH-50%, serum elastase and scintigraphy using Tc99 labeled leukocytes. There were significant differences in parameters of humoral and cell-mediated response between implantation of peritoneal patch and vascular graft. Twelve months later histological examination was made to determine healing processes of implanted materials. The results of this study are encouraging and confirm benefits of peritoneal patch in vascular surgery creating a new possibilities of angioplasty.

TI  - Treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis with intraocular implants.  
AB  - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis affects 20% to 40% of patients with AIDS and is the leading cause of vision loss associated with AIDS. Three treatment options currently exist (ie, IV administration of antiviral medications, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir, surgical implantation of devices that provide sustained release of ganciclovir). As patients with AIDS live longer, perioperative nurses may care for more patients with CMV retinitis who undergo implantation of these devices.

TI  - Treatment of relapsed cytomegalovirus retinitis with the sustained-release ganciclovir implant.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Sustained-release ganciclovir implants are effective in delaying progression of newly diagnosed cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. An uncontrolled case series was assembled to evaluate the efficacy of the intravitreal ganciclovir implant for patients with sight-threatening CMV retinitis who had previously failed to respond to intravenous ganciclovir and/or foscarnet. METHODS: Between August 1993 and March 1995, 72 eyes of 55 patients received intravitreal ganciclovir implants. Patients were examined monthly after implant surgery. RESULTS: A total of 56 eyes (77.8%) were available for evaluation after implant surgery. At the 1-month postoperative visit, 48 eyes (85.7%) of 38 patients had no progression. Implants failed to control progression at the 1-month visit in eight eyes (14.3%) of six patients receiving primary implants. A total of 32 eyes (57.1%) of 29 patients did not experience three-line loss of visual acuity through the follow-up period. The median time to three-line loss was 190 days from implantation. Four eyes (7.1%) developed visual acuity of 20/200 or worse by the 1-month follow up. The median time from implantation to development of visual acuity of 20/200 or less was 224 days. The median survival time was 376 days from study entry. The most common postoperative complication was retinal detachment, which was observed in 12 eyes receiving implants. Additional self-limiting complications included significant vitreous hemorrhage (three eyes) and hypotony maculopathy (two eyes). CONCLUSION: Ganciclovir implants were effective in delaying visual loss in a significant proportion of patients who failed ganciclovir or foscarnet therapy. A number of these patients, however, experienced visual loss. Although the implants can be effective as therapy for relapsed CMV retinitis, the efficacy does not appear to match that noted in initial CMV retinitis therapy.

TI  - [Cold deformation elements for attaching an implantable hearing aid transducer to ear ossicles or perilymph]  
AB  - Development and short-term implantation results of the Tubingen implantable hearing aid (TI = Tubingen implant) have been presented. The TI is designed for patients with sensorineural hearing loss due to a malfunction of the cochlear amplifier. This can be identified by the presence of positive recruitment and the absence of TEOAE (transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions). The Tubingen implant functions in two ways: it allows electronic amplification of the auditory signal and electromechanical signal transduction into a micromechanical vibratory stimulus. There are two paths by which vibratory stimulus reaches the cochlea: (1) directly through a perforation in the stapes foot plate into the perilymph or (2) via the ossicular chain. Made of pure titanium, the casing of the helium-tight welded transducer includes the piezoelectric actuator. An implantable manipulator device is designed for transducer positioning and anchoring in the mastoid cavity. Usually, the transducer probe tip is directly coupled to the body of the incus. This functions without a special coupling device by utilization of an Erbium-YAG laser. Special anatomical situations or the loss of incus and/or stapes suprastructure, however, requires coupling of the vibratory signal to other points of the ossicular chain or to the perilymph. A major problem, however, was an intraoperative, irreversible link between the titanium probe tip and coupling elements. To overcome this problem, the coupling elements were made of gold. A crimp technique was developed, allowing the surgeon to induce cold deformation of the gold. The cold deformation technique (crimp) results in an irreversible coupling between the titanium probe tip and the golden coupling element.

TI  - A cytoplasmic cell cycle controls the activity of a K+ channel in pre-implantation mouse embryos.  
AB  - We previously have reported that the activity of a 240 pS K+ channel varies during the cell cycle in pre-implantation mouse embryos. In the present study, we show that: (i) the cycling of channel activity is not prevented by inhibiting protein synthesis and hence does not involve cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1)-cyclin B; and (ii) the cycling of channel activity continues in anucleate zygote fragments with a time course similar to that observed in nucleate fragments. We further demonstrate that: (i) persistent activation of the K+ channel in one-cell embryos arrested in metaphase requires the maintenance of an active cdk1-cyclin B complex; and (ii) both DNA synthesis inhibition with aphidicolin and DNA damage produced by mitomycin C prevent the down-regulation of the channel at the start of S phase by a mechanism that requires tyrosine kinase activation. Thus, the 240 pS K+ channel in these cells is controlled by a previously unsuspected cytoplasmic clock that functions independently of the well-known clock controlling the chromosomal cell cycle, but can interact with it.

TI  - Clinical and angiographic outcome of Micro Stent II implantation in native coronary arteries.  
AB  - To evaluate immediate success and 6-month restenosis rate, 70 Micro Stents II were implanted for 65 stenoses in 63 patients (age 59+/-9 years). Stable angina pectoris was present in 47% of the patients (38% class I to III; 9% class IV), whereas 32% had postinfarction angina and 21% had unstable angina. Indications for stent implantation were elective in 62% and semi-elective in 38% of the patients. Sixty-two percent of the patients received ticlopidin and acetylsalicylic acid for 28 days, whereas 38% of the patients received only acetylsalicylic acid. All stents were deployed successfully at the target site. Subacute closure occurred in 2 patients (3%), both of whom were not treated with ticlopidin. Two other patients (3%) developed non-Q-wave infarction after side branch occlusion during the procedure. The minimum lumen diameter increased from 1.0+/-0.5 mm to 2.8+/-0.4 mm after stent implantation. At follow-up the loss in diameter was 0.9+/-0.6 mm, indicating a net gain of 0.9+/-0.8 mm. Late clinical events (4 weeks to 6 months) were coronary angioplasty of a stented segment (3%), coronary angioplasty of a nonstented segment (10%), and coronary artery bypass grafting (2%). No deaths or myocardial infarction occurred. The procedural success rate was 94% and the event-free survival at 6-month follow-up was 79%. Micro Stent II implantation can be done with a high rate of immediate success and good 6-month outcome. The Micro Stent II has proven to be a versatile device that can also be used in patients with less favorable coronary anatomy or lesion characteristics.

AB  - We describe two patients with defibrillation failure of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) resulting from large left pneumothoraxes following subclavian vein puncture during the implantation. Following pneumothorax drainage, low defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) were attained without further manipulations. The absence of other signs and symptoms of pneumothorax and the presence of satisfactory pacing function during the procedure, resulted in a significant delay in diagnosis. Pneumothorax should be included in the differential diagnosis when unexpected high DFTs are found during ICD implantation or predischarge testing. This complication is avoidable by a different surgical approach, cephalic vein cutdown.

TI  - Effects on brain tumor cell proliferation by an adenovirus vector that bears the interleukin-4 gene.  
AB  - A recombinant adenovirus vector bearing the IL-4 gene (AD-IL-4) was used to infect rat glioma C6 cells in culture at multiplicity of infections (MOI) from 50 to 1800. C6 cell proliferation was not altered significantly by adenoviral infection. However, IL-4 production increased in a dose-dependent manner. To ascertain effects on in vivo cell proliferation, a subcutaneous tumor model was used. Rat C6 glioma cells alone or C6 mixed with the control virus bearing the LacZ gene (Ad-LacZ) produced tumors that measured an average of approximately 3000 mm3 35 days after implantation. In contrast, C6 cells mixed with Ad-IL-4 produced significant inhibition of tumor growth (P=0.035 compared to C6 tumor; P=0.023 compared to C6+Ad-LacZ tumor. Student's ttest). IL-4 levels in mice serum were measured by ELISA and reached a peak of approximately 700 pg/ml at 14 days. These preliminary results showed that adenovirus-mediated delivery of the IL-4 gene may result in a significant inhibition of rat C6 cell tumor growth. Further studies will be necessary to refine this anti-tumor effect for as a potential therapy for cancer.

TI  - Comparison of decentration and tilt between one piece and three piece polymethyl methacrylate intraocular lenses.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent of the decentration and tilt was prospectively compared between one piece polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and three piece PMMA intraocular lenses (IOLs) which were implanted in the capsular bag after performing continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis. METHODS: 91 patients underwent a one piece PMMA IOL implantation in one eye as well as the implantation of the three piece PMMA IOL with polyvinylidene fluoride loops in the opposite eye. The length of the lens decentration and the angle of the tilt were quantitated using the anterior eye segment analysis system (EAS-1000) at 1 week as well as 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean length of the decentration in the one piece IOL was smaller than that in the three piece IOL at 1 week (p = 0.0092), 1 month (p = 0.0044), 3 months (p = 0.0069), and 6 months (p = 0.0010) postoperatively. However, no significant difference was found in the degree of the tilt between the two types of IOLs throughout the observation periods. CONCLUSION: These results clarified that the one piece PMMA IOL with rigid PMMA haptics implanted in the capsular bag provides a better centration than the three piece PMMA IOL with flexible haptics, whereas the tilt was the same between the two types of IOLs.

TI  - A stimulating nerve cuff for chronic in vivo measurements of torque produced about the ankle in the mouse.  
AB  - Specific muscle training and chronic contractile measurements are difficult in rodents, especially in the mouse. The primary reason for this is the lack of a means for stimulating the motor nerve that does not damage the nerve and that permits reproducible measurements of contractility. In this paper, we describe procedures for the construction and implantation of a stimulating nerve cuff for use on the mouse common peroneal nerve. We demonstrate that nerve cuff implantation success rates can be high (i.e., 75-93%), as determined from measurements of maximal isometric torque produced by the anterior crural muscles. Isometric torque production is not adversely affected by the nerve cuff because the torque produced matches that observed in our established percutaneous stimulation model. We also demonstrate that use of the nerve cuff for stimulation is compatible with electromyographic measurements made on the tibialis anterior muscle, with no sign of stimulation artifact in the electromyographic signal.

TI  - [Vaginal template implant for cervical carcinoma with vaginal stenosis]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For cervical carcinoma patients with poor geometry for conventional intracavitary radiotherapy, a simple vaginal template for interstitial implantation as a substitute was used. This is a report of the treatment results. METHODS: Patients with vaginal stenosis were treated over from July 1987 to June 1991 with this vaginal template implant as part of the treatment. The applicator consisted of a front piece and an end piece. Holes were drilled in the front piece to guide the implantation of the cervix or vaginal vault. The diameter of applicators varied from 2.0 cm to 3.5 cm. Depending on the diameter of the applicators, six to eight needles on the periphery, or eight peripheral plus one central needle were used. The activity of the needles were around 8 mCi with a total length of 5.5 cm. The end piece was locked onto the front piece by a bayonet-type locking device. The purpose of the end piece was two-fold: to make up the length of the whole applicator to fit the vagina and to keep the implanted needles in place without being extruded. The implantation was performed under general anesthesia. RESULTS: One of the twelve patients treated with the vaginal template implant for vaginal stenosis had relapsed centrally but subsequently died of intercurrent disease. Two other patients died of intercurrent disease at 26.2 and 41.9 months, respectively, without evidence of relapse. Nine other patients had been followed with no evidence of local relapse for 23.7 to 54.6 months. CONCLUSION: This vaginal template implantation is satisfactory in treating cervical carcinoma patients with vaginal stenosis.

TI  - The increased need for a permanent pacemaker after reoperative cardiac surgery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The requirement for permanent pacemaker implantation after most initial cardiac surgical procedures generally is less than 3%. To identify the incidence and factors related to permanent pacemaker need after repeat cardiac surgery, we retrospectively studied 558 consecutive patients undergoing at least one repeat cardiac operation. METHOD: Univariable and multivariable analyses of comorbidity, preoperative catheterization values, and operative data were performed to identify factors related to pacemaker implantation. RESULTS: In this group, 54 patients (9.7%) required a permanent pacemaker. A multivariable model showed a relationship between a permanent pacemaker and tricuspid valve replacement/annuloplasty associated with aortic/mitral valve replacement, preoperative endocarditis, increasing number of reoperations, the degree of hypothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass, and advanced age. Additional univariable predictors of pacemaker need included multiple valve replacement, increased cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic crossclamp times, and aortic valve replacement. Over 90% of patients who have or have not received permanent pacemaker implantation were in New York Heart Association class I to II, with a mean follow-up time of 6 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were statistically similar for both groups at 5 and 10 years after the operation. CONCLUSION: Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in 9.7% of patients undergoing repeat cardiac surgery. This represented approximately a fourfold increase compared with similar primary operations reported in other series. Factors strongly related to this need included valve replacement, preoperative endocarditis, number of reoperations, advanced age, and degree of hypothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass. The need for a permanent pacemaker after reoperations did not result in significant long-term impairment of functional status or longevity compared with those who did not require a permanent pacemaker.

TI  - A feasibility study evaluating rhBMP-2/absorbable collagen sponge device for local alveolar ridge preservation or augmentation.  
AB  - This two-center human clinical trial evaluated recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 delivered in an absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS) for either alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction or augmentation of localized osseous defects. This 24-month study comprised two parts: a 4-month acute safety and bone induction period (Part I) followed by a 20-month, osseointegration, functional restoration, and long-term safety evaluation (Part II). The primary objective of Part I, discussed in this article, was to evaluate the short-term safety and technical feasibility of the rhBMP-2 device implantation. Twelve patients (six preservation and six augmentation) were enrolled in the investigation. Patient safety was monitored by oral examinations, radiographs, and the collection of blood samples to measure serum chemistries, hematology, and potential antibody formation. Technical feasibility was evaluated by collecting information relating to the handling properties of the rhBMP-2/ACS device. The ability of various evaluative tools to measure the bone-inducing activity of the rhBMP-2/ACS device was also assessed. The clinical results suggested that rhBMP-2/ACS was well tolerated locally and systemically, with no serious adverse events. The device was found to be easily handled and adapted to the ridge and extraction socket. Using direct measurements, all sites demonstrated firmness and fullness to palpation at 4 weeks; however, a loss of volume was noted in some treatment areas between 4 and 8 weeks. Augmentation of the alveolar ridge was not observed in the patients as assessed by the evaluation techniques. This trial indicated that the use of rhBMP-2/ACS to preserve alveolar ridge after tooth extraction or augmentation of localized defects is safe and feasible. Bone fill was observed in all alveolar sockets filled with the rhBMP-2 device.

TI  - Treatment of long dissections by use of a single long or multiple short stents: clinical and angiographic follow-up.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, long (> or =20 mm) coronary stents were introduced for clinical use. They are intended as an alternative to multiple conventional stents to treat extensive dissections or suboptimal results of long lesions after balloon angioplasty. METHODS: In a total of 113 such consecutive vessels in 107 patients, the flexible Freedom stent was implanted. In 60 of these vessels, because of anatomic constraints, multiple overlapping short (16 mm) stents were implanted. The other 53 vessels were treated with a single long (> or =20 mm) stent. RESULTS: In the single stent group there were four implantation failures (8%) successfully managed by crossover to multiple overlapping short stents. During early follow-up, in-stent thrombosis was not observed, but three patients with a single long stent and two patients with multiple overlapping stents suffered myocardial infarction as a result of long lasting myocardial ischemia during a difficult angioplasty procedure. At 6-month follow-up, > or =50% restenosis was measured in 29% and 35% of the patients with a single long stent and in those with multiple overlapping stents, respectively (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the alternative treatment modality (i.e., implantation of multiple short stents), no difference between in-hospital and 6-month outcome was observed. However, implantation of a single long stent, when technically feasible, reduces catheterization time, dye volume for the patient, and radiation exposure for both patient and operator during these embarrassing angioplasty procedures.

TI  - Cochlear implants in children: an analysis of use over a three-year period.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether children continue to wear their cochlear implant systems 1 and 3 years after implantation. STUDY DESIGN: The design was a prospective study based on the analysis of forced-choice questionnaires on implant use completed independently by parents and teachers. SETTING: The study was performed at a dedicated pediatric cochlear implant program in a tertiary referral center in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: All 85 consecutively implanted children who had reached the 1-year interval after implantation and 37 children who had reached the 3-year assessment interval after implantation participated. The patients represented all socioeconomic status groups, the entire range of educational settings, and often lived at a considerable distance from the implant center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents and local teachers were asked to describe implant use in the following categories: 1) all of the time; 2) most of the time; 3) some of the time; and 4) none of the time. RESULTS: One year after implantation, parents and teachers, respectively, rated 79 (93%) and 82 (96%) children as full-time users (category 1). Parents rated six children (7%) as users most of the time (category 2), and teachers rated three children (4%) as users most of the time. No child was rated as an occasional or nonuser (category 3 or 4). At 3 years after implantation, 33 (89%) and 34 (95%) children were rated as full-time users (category 1) by parents and teachers, respectively. Parents judged four children (11%) and teachers rated two children (5%) to be users most of the time (category 2). Again, no child was rated in category 3 or 4 as an occasional or nonuser. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of implanted children use their implant systems all of the time over a 3-year period after implantation when selected appropriately and given appropriate follow-up.

TI  - Indications and counterindications for cochlear implantation in children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to analyze the current indications and counterindications of cochlear implantation (CI) in children. STUDY DESIGN: This study reviews the children implanted in our institution looking specifically at the following aspects: 1) auditory criteria for candidate selection; 2) age at implantation; 3) educational environment; and 4) associated handicapping conditions. SETTING: Tertiary referral center with experience in CI since 1989 with inpatient and outpatient care. INTERVENTION: All children received a Mini Nucleus 22 CI device (Cochlear Limited, Australia) in a standard surgical procedure. RESULTS: Regarding auditory criteria, children with average hearing level of 100-105 dB HL are more likely to obtain benefit from a CI than from a hearing aid. The minimum age for CI should be as soon as there is a reliable diagnosis of bilateral profound hearing loss, while the maximum age for CI depends on strict selection criteria of candidates. The educational environment is of a great importance in the rehabilitation process, permitting a progressive change to oral communication. Our experience in CI of children with multiple handicapping conditions is limited to a case of a deaf-blind child who was implanted with a good performance. In the selection of these children it is mandatory to have extensive multidisciplinary evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: An experienced team is needed in the selection of children for CI. Candidates should meet anatomic criteria, have a reliable diagnosis of bilateral profound hearing loss, an evaluation of communication skills, and extensive neuropediatric and socioeducational evaluation.

TI  - Influence of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, testosterone, and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-all-trans-retinamide on prostate cancer induction in Wistar-Unilever rats.  
AB  - The influence of chemical carcinogen, hormonal stimulation, and chronic dietary administration of the synthetic retinoid, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-all-trans-retinamide (4-HPR), on the induction of prostate cancer in male Wistar-Unilever rats was determined. Three different tumor induction regimens were used: (a) a single i.v. dose of 50 mg of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) per kg body weight, followed by chronic androgen stimulation via s.c. implantation of two silastic capsules containing 40 mg testosterone each; (b) a single i.v. dose of 50 mg of MNU per kg body weight (no testosterone treatment); and (c) chronic androgen stimulation with implanted testosterone capsules (no MNU treatment). In a fourth series of animals, the incidence of spontaneous prostate tumors was determined in groups of rats receiving neither carcinogen nor hormone stimulation. Within each series, parallel groups of animals were fed a control (vehicle-supplemented) diet or control diet supplemented with 4-HPR beginning 1 day after carcinogen administration; retinoid administration was continuous until termination of the study at 450 days. The incidence of accessory sex gland cancer in rats treated sequentially with MNU + testosterone was >60%, in comparison with cancer incidences of <20% in rats receiving MNU only and <5% in rats treated with testosterone only. No spontaneous accessory sex gland tumors were observed in rats receiving no carcinogen and no testosterone. Tumor induction in the accessory sex glands by MNU + testosterone was relatively specific for the prostate: the incidence of carcinoma of the dorsolateral/anterior prostate was more than 5-fold greater than the incidence of cancer present only in the seminal vesicle. 4-HPR conferred no protection against cancer induction in the prostate by any regimen of MNU and/or testosterone. These results demonstrate the importance of both carcinogen exposure and hormone stimulation on the induction of neoplasia in the prostate of Wistar-Unilever rats.

TI  - [Developmental neuronal plasticity and its importance in the recovery and function of neural tissue]  
AB  - Plasticity is understand as a natural ability of the nervous tissue to respond to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli by means of functional or structural changes. All its manifestations, including the developmental changes and processes of recovery are controlled by general genetic programs. One of the major research goals in the field of neuroplasticity is to design a strategy for the activation of the functional recovery. Enough evidence has shown that the internal environment of the nervous tissue is one of the decisive factors which determine the degree of both the developmental and regenerative plasticity. To improve capacity for the recovery it is therefore necessary to activate these intrinsic neuroplastic mechanisms. One alternative is the method of implantation of the embryonal nerve cells suspension into the site of neuronal lesion. The grafted cells can either replace the lost cells or they might become a source of stimulating factors which may activate the process of recovery. In the model of the intrahippocampal pathways interruption (experimental partial elimination of granule cells in the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus), the subsequent implantation of embryonal neurons of the same origin into the site of lesion can partly restore the structural pattern of the gyrus dentatus and probably preserve some of the afferent connections. However, the outgrow of efferent fibers probably remains limited to the grafted tissue.

TI  - Vancomycin-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection: report of two cases.  
AB  - Two patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection were treated with vancomycin (VCM)-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads. One patient, who had a history of polycystic kidney and diabetes mellitus, who was receiving hemodialysis due because of non-functional kidney, underwent resection of an intermediate grade chondrosarcoma in the pelvis. MRSA infection developed and curettage of the lesion was performed, but MRSA infection recurred. During the second revision surgery, VCM-impregnated PMMA beads were implanted. MRSA infection has not recurred for 16 months since the implantation of the VCM beads. The second patient had a history of total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed because of coxarthrosis. After the initial surgery, MRSA infection developed, recurring after the second revision surgery for THA. After curettage following removal of the prosthesis, VCM beads were implanted with a spacer composed of VCM-PMMA and a Luque rod. Infection did not recur and THA revision was performed 3 months after the VCM beads implantation. Fifteen months after the last revision surgery, infection has not recurred.

TI  - Graded reduction of Pafah1b1 (Lis1) activity results in neuronal migration defects and early embryonic lethality [see comments]  
AB  - Heterozygous mutation or deletion of the beta subunit of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH1B1, also known as LIS1) in humans is associated with type I lissencephaly, a severe developmental brain disorder thought to result from abnormal neuronal migration. To further understand the function of PAFAH1B1, we produced three different mutant alleles in mouse Pafah1b1. Homozygous null mice die early in embryogenesis soon after implantation. Mice with one inactive allele display cortical, hippocampal and olfactory bulb disorganization resulting from delayed neuronal migration by a cell-autonomous neuronal pathway. Mice with further reduction of Pafah1b1 activity display more severe brain disorganization as well as cerebellar defects. Our results demonstrate an essential, dosage-sensitive neuronal-specific role for Pafah1b1 in neuronal migration throughout the brain, and an essential role in early embryonic development. The phenotypes observed are distinct from those of other mouse mutants with neuronal migration defects, suggesting that Pafah1b1 participates in a novel pathway for neuronal migration.

TI  - Silica sol-gel encapsulation of pancreatic islets.  
AB  - We developed a biocomposite material containing silica ceramic. The sol-gel technology in which ceramic materials are polymerized from liquid solutions at room temperature and physiologic pH can be used to produce ceramics that have a determined pore size and that contain living organisms or cells. Capsules were stable to extreme acid and base conditions as well as to trypsin in vitro for 6 months. We used insulin-secreting murine islet cells as the first mammalian material for encapsulation. Two approaches to generating successful encapsulation of islets were used: drop-tower sphere generation and emulsion. Sphere diameters of less than 1 mm were associated with positive insulin secretory capacity as documented by a static batch incubation technique. Average pore sizes were 161 A for drop-tower spheres and 105 A for emulsion spheres. Capsules allowed the passage of insulin and cytokines but not the passage of antibody.  Implantation of encapsulated islets did not result in fibrosis of the capsule in vivo, and retrieval of capsules after 1 month in vivo documented continued insulin secretory capacity. Further in vivo experiments documented increased survival of transplant recipients despite failure to achieve normoglycemia in all but a few cases. Silica sol-gel encapsulation provides a potentially useful alternative for encapsulation of cells for transplantation or drug delivery, and further work is warranted to develop this potentially useful approach for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

TI  - [The fluoroscopy-guided implantation of subcutaneous venous ports: the complications and long-term results]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of technical success rate, long-term outcome and initial complication rate in patients with fluoroscopically guided port implantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1994 and April 1997 124 ports were implanted under fluoroscopic guidance in 120 patients. Indications for port implantation were anti-cancer chemotherapy, antibiotic and supportive therapy in patients with tumours or cachexia. RESULTS: Implantation was technically successful in 98.4% of the patients. We had a 3.2% minor complication rate that did not necessitate further treatment. One pneumothorax required a chest tube (0.8%). During a total of 17,534 days, complications occurred in 10.8% of all ports, 6.9% of the ports had to be explanted because of these complications. CONCLUSIONS: Insertion of ports under fluoroscopic guidance has a low complication rate and good long-term results. The rate of 93.1% of functioning ports is superior to that reported in other studies. It is less costly and has a lower complication rate than surgical implantation. Therefore it seems to be the method of choice for patients requiring long-term subcutaneous venous access for chemotherapy or supportive therapy in malignant tumours or other emaciating diseases.

TI  - Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy to evaluate patients after coronary stent implantation.  
AB  - Coronary stent implantation is an increasingly accepted revascularization method. The 20%-30% restenosis rate during the first 6 mo requires a close follow-up of the patients. Since there is very little data available defining the role of perfusion scintigraphy in the management of this population, the aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging for detecting restenosis in patients after coronary stent implantation. METHODS: In 82 patients, 93 rest or stress SPECT studies were performed using 201Tl and 99mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile to evaluate 99 vascular territories with implanted coronary stents. The average interval between the stent implantation and the scintigraphic study was 210.5 +/- 129.6 days. The scintiscans were visually evaluated. A stress-induced perfusion defect with reversibility at rest was used as the criterion for stent restenosis. RESULTS: Coronary angiography revealed a stenosis of > 50% diameter in the region of the stent in 19 arteries, while in 80 arteries there was no evidence of restenosis angiographically. With perfusion scintigraphy, 15/19 vascular territories with restenosed stents showed stress-induced perfusion abnormalities (sensitivity = 79%), while 62/80 territories without restenosis did not (specificity = 78%). In territories without a myocardial infarction (n = 48), sensitivity and specificity values were 8/8 (100%) and 36/44 (82%), and in territories with a myocardial infarction (n = 47) 7/11 (64%) and 26/36 (72%), respectively. Side branch stenosis was fairly frequent in patients without stent restenosis but with a reversible perfusion pattern on their scintiscan (8/18); however, these stenoses were induced infrequently by the stents (3 cases). CONCLUSION: Using the criterion of defect reversibility, stress perfusion SPECT can accurately detect restenoses of coronary artery stents. This method is most accurate for evaluating patients without a previous myocardial infarction in the stented vascular territory.

TI  - Fine trabecularized carbon: ideal material and texture for percutaneous device system of permanent left ventricular assist device.  
AB  - The development of a percutaneous artificial internal organ system requires a reliable biocompatible connection between the external environment and the inside of the human body. Such is necessary for the success of a permanent left ventricular assist device. However, the search for a satisfactory interface at the epidermal level has proven to be difficult. Carbon has been proposed for this application, but its texture does not typically promote ingrowth from surrounding tissue. We have therefore employed a new processing method to produce a fine trabecularized carbon implant. The method for preparing the implant involves infiltrating low temperature pyrolytic carbon into the surface of a carbon core which is wrapped with carbon fabric. This results in a tightly woven porous structure of carbon (carbon fiber diameter: 35-50 microm, maximal pore size >200 microm) with gradually increasing porosity from 15-75%. We implanted test samples percutaneously in a calf for in vivo histological evaluation. Thirty days after implantation epidermal downgrowth was minimal. Microscopic analysis revealed that a thin fibrous capsule surrounded the implant, and mature connective tissue with accompanying blood vessels filled the pores of the fine trabecularized carbon layer. From these results we suggest that fine trabecularized carbon is ideally suited for a percutaneous device system in a permanent left ventricular assist device.

TI  - Intrathoracic and intraabdominal wall implantation of a centrifugal blood pump for circulatory assist.  
AB  - An implantable centrifugal pump (ICP) 320 ml in volume and 830 g in weight has been developed for prolonged circulatory assist. The antithrombogenicity of the ICP is provided by a balancing hole in the center of the impeller. The watertightness and histocompatibility of the ICP are supported by its silicone ring seal and its casing of titanium and acrylic resin, respectively. The total efficiency of the ICP was 30% at a 5 L/min flow rate and a 100 mm Hg head. The heat generation, watertightness, and anatomical fitting of the ICP were assessed in an intrathoracic implantation in a goat (66 kg) and in an intraabdominal wall implantation in a goat (70 kg). Warfarin was given for anticoagulation in each experiment to keep the prothrombin time around 1.7 times that of the control. The temperatures of the pump surface, the pleura, and the room were measured every 3 h. Anatomical fitting was evaluated by pathological observation after the termination of the experiment. The ICP could run for 40 days in the chest cavity and for 11 days in the abdominal wall. The temperature of the motor remained about 1.8 degrees C higher than the reference in both experiments. The ICP was completely covered by a layer of smooth fibrous tissue. The moisture content of the seals remained normal. Although a small amount of atelectasis was found in the lingula, neither lung adhesion nor necrotic change of the chest wall was observed. The inflammation of the surrounding tissue including foreign body reaction and thermal burn was minimal. In conclusion, the ICP has satisfied in vivo testing of its watertightness, exothermicity, and anatomical fitting.

TI  - Computer-assisted histometric analysis of tissue-engineered ovine bone.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a computer-assisted histometric technique that quantitatively determines the amount of regenerating bone, while excluding fibrovascular tissue and void spaces, in tissue-engineered bone constructs. To this end, a histometric technique was developed that couples digital tiling with adaptive, multiband color thresholding (AMBCT). STUDY DESIGN: To test the technique, a previously described model bone tissue-engineered construct filled with morcellized bone graft was employed. Histometric techniques were applied to quantify the amount of bone formed following eight weeks of implantation. RESULTS: The histometric technique was able to yield quantitative information regarding the amount of bone despite intrahistologic and interhistologic differences in staining. The technique is user friendly and highly automated. In addition to area fractions, the technique can provide bone ingrowth profiles as a function of geometry and implantation time. CONCLUSION: Digital tiling coupled with AMBCT offers an easy, fast and reproducible technique that aids in quantification of bone within histologic sections. In addition, the technique can be adapted to quantification of other tissues. Further studies are under way to investigate the potential of correlating the histometric technique with mechanical strength analyses of tissue-engineered bone specimens.

TI  - A simplified method for silicone intubation in lacrimal drainage obstruction.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To simplify the surgical procedure in silicone tube implantation for lacrimal drainage obstruction. METHODS: To reduce the problem of retrieving the leader from under the inferior turbinate, I developed a method where I probe the canaliculi with a pigtail probe, allowing a leader to pass through both canaliculi simultaneously. The leader is then retrieved under direct visualization to minimize trauma. RESULTS: This new method necessitates only one retrieval of the leader in the nasal cavity instead of two. This single retrieval is also made easier. CONCLUSIONS: A surgically demanding and time-consuming procedure is made easier for the surgeon and the inconvenience for the patient is reduced.

TI  - Evidence for a central origin of the low-frequency oscillation in RR-interval variability.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short-term variability of RR interval and blood pressure occurs predominantly at low frequency (LF; approximately 0.1 Hz) and high frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz). The arterial baroreflex is thought to be the predominant determinant of the LF component of RR variability. Patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) have an attenuated or absent LF oscillation in RR variability. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) offers a unique possibility for analysis of spectral oscillations in RR interval independent of any effects of blood pressure that influence these oscillations via the baroreflex. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed spectral analysis of RR, blood pressure, and respiration in 2 patients with CHF before and after LVAD implantation. LF components of the RR-interval and blood pressure variability were absent in both CHF patients before LVAD implantation. After LVAD implantation, spectral analysis of the RR interval showed restoration of a clear and predominant LF oscillation in the native hearts of both patients, with no such oscillation evident in the blood pressure profile. CONCLUSIONS: During total circulatory support with the LVAD, the LF oscillation in RR interval of the native heart, absent in CHF, is restored. This LF oscillation in RR interval occurs in the absence of LF oscillations in blood pressure and thus is unlikely to be explained by baroreflex mechanisms. Hence, the absence of LF oscillation in the RR interval in CHF is functional and is reversible by LVAD circulation. The presence of a predominant LF oscillation in RR interval independent of any oscillation in blood pressure suggests that the LF oscillation is a fundamental property of central autonomic outflow.

TI  - Short-term effects of nicotine on bone and calciotropic hormones in adult female rats.  
AB  - This study assessed the effects of two months nicotine treatment on bone formation and resorption end-points in adult, female rats. In addition, the concentrations of calciotropic hormones which included parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in rats (7 months old) were determined. All animals received either saline (n = 7/group), nicotine (3.0 mg/kg/day) (n = 7/group) or nicotine (4.5 mg/kg/day) (n = 7/group) via subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps containing either saline or nicotine for a period of two months. Serum, right tibia, left femur and lumbar vertebra (3-5) were collected for determination of hormonal concentrations as well as various parameters, including histomorphometry, bone mineral density, bone mineral content and vertebral strength. Although nicotine-treated rats showed a lower level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [54.4 +/- 3.1 ng/ml for the 3.0 mg/kg/day and 55.8 +/- 2.8 for the 4.5 mg/kg/day group] (mean +/- S.E.M.) as compared to controls (74.8 +/- 2.8 ng/ml) (P < 0.01, Newman-Keuls test), no significant difference could be detected for the levels of the remaining hormones. Similarly, no statistical differences were detected on histomorphometric end-points, bone mineral density, bone mineral content and vertebral strength of rats. We conclude that, in spite of lowering serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D by about 30%, nicotine administration of two months duration does not alter bone mass, strength or formation and resorption end-points.

TI  - Immediate reproducibility of upper limit of vulnerability measurements in patients undergoing transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Measurement of the upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) with monophasic T wave shocks has been proposed as a patient-specific measurement of defibrillation efficacy that results in fewer episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) than measurement of a defibrillation efficacy curve. METHODS AND RESULTS: We sought to determine the magnitude of variance in ULV in 63 consecutive patients undergoing implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). We measured ULV as the strength at or above which VF is not induced when a stimulus is delivered at 310 msec after an 8-beat ventricular pacing drive at 400 msec. Defibrillation threshold (DFT) was measured in patients with an active can device using a biphasic waveform and the binary search method beginning at 12 J. Sixty-three patients were studied; they had a mean age of 62 +/- 12 years and a mean ejection fraction of 35% +/- 15%. Three quarters of patients had an ischemic cardiomyopathy. Each patient underwent 4.5 +/- 0.8 measurements of ULV. Monophasic ULV correlated poorly with biphasic DFT (R between 0.19 and 0.28, P = 0.04 to 0.17). There was no change in ULV between second to third, third to fourth, and first to last measurement in 22% to 41% of patients. The reliability coefficient was 0.87. A ULV > or = 20 J was found in eight patients. The only predictor of high ULV was a high DFT. CONCLUSION: Monophasic ULVs do not closely predict biphasic active can DFTs using a standard protocol. High DFTs were predicted by high ULVs. There was little variation in the acute measurement of ULV between trials. These findings have important implications for using ULV measurements to determine changes in DFTs after interventions. The methodology of determining ULV is critical to its use for predicting DFTs and programming ICDs.

TI  - Variation in clear cornea incision size after phacoemulsification and foldable lens implantation.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the changes in clear cornea incision size after phacoemulsification and implantation of a three-piece, silicone, foldable intraocular lens (IOL). SETTING: Departamento de Oftalmologia, Clinica Universitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. METHODS: In this prospective study, phacoemulsification with implantation of a foldable IOL (AMO SI-30NB) was performed in 133 eyes. Surgery was carried out by four surgeons who implanted the IOL with the same forceps. The external incision size was measured before and after phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration and before and after IOL implantation. RESULTS: Before phacoemulsification the mean incision size was 3.07 mm; after phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration, it enlarged to 3.09 mm (P = .001). The mean incision size before foldable IOL implantation was 3.16 mm, and after implantation it increased to 3.32 mm (P = .0001). When the IOL was less than 22.0 diopters (D), the final incision size was 3.31 mm +/- 0.11 (SD); when the IOL was 22.0 to 26.0 D, the final size was 3.32 +/- 0.01 mm; and when the IOL was 26.0 D or more, the final size was 3.39 +/- 0.08 mm (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification and foldable IOL implantation enlarged the size of the clear cornea incision in this study. The IOL power may be a significant factor in determining the minimal incision size prior to IOL insertion and the final incision size.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the changes in clear cornea incision size after phacoemulsification and implantation of a three-piece, silicone, foldable intraocular lens (IOL). SETTING: Departamento de Oftalmologia, Clinica Universitaria de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. METHODS: In this prospective study, phacoemulsification with implantation of a foldable IOL (AMO SI-30NB) was performed in 133 eyes. Surgery was carried out by four surgeons who implanted the IOL with the same forceps. The external incision size was measured before and after phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration and before and after IOL implantation. RESULTS: Before phacoemulsification the mean incision size was 3.07 mm; after phacoemulsification and irrigation/aspiration, it enlarged to 3.09 mm (P = .001). The mean incision size before foldable IOL implantation was 3.16 mm, and after implantation it increased to 3.32 mm (P = .0001). When the IOL was less than 22.0 diopters (D), the final incision size was 3.31 mm +/- 0.11 (SD); when the IOL was 22.0 to 26.0 D, the final size was 3.32 +/- 0.01 mm; and when the IOL was 26.0 D or more, the final size was 3.39 +/- 0.08 mm (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification and foldable IOL implantation enlarged the size of the clear cornea incision in this study. The IOL power may be a significant factor in determining the minimal incision size prior to IOL insertion and the final incision size.

TI  - Long-term fate of Plastipore in the middle ear.  
AB  - Four Plastipore prostheses, removed at revision surgery 7-10 years after implantation, have been examined. The gross appearance of the prostheses was preserved. The prostheses were surrounded by a fibrous tissue capsule and showed fibrous tissue ingrowth localized in peripheral zones. Foreign-body giant cells and macrophages were detected in small numbers. Histologic evidence of breakdown of the prostheses, in the form of microdisintegration of the walls of micropores, was detected on a small scale. Compared to the massive foreign-body reactions reported in short-term studies, the tissue reaction apparently subsides with time and becomes insignificant. Strict criteria for insertion should be regarded.

TI  - Diagnosing coronary arterial stent thrombosis and arterial closure.  
AB  - This single-center review of a consecutive series of patients requiring reexamination by angiography within 1 week of a coronary stent placement due to chest pain reveals that patients treated with a poststent anticoagulation regimen of warfarin and aspirin, and those with lower poststent deployment dilation pressures, have an increased risk of subacute stent thrombosis. Repeat cardiac catheterization within the first week after coronary artery stent implantation should be reserved for patients with significant electrocardiographic changes.

TI  - [Interventional palliative therapy]  
AB  - From diagnostic procedures interventional radiology has developed a large number of therapeutic methods that have found a place in the treatment of palliative care patients. Minimal invasiveness and high efficiency characterise the implantation of metallic stents in the treatment of malignant biliary or esophageal obstruction and vena cava compression syndrome. Transcatheter arterial embolisation, chemoembolisation and chemoinfusion for palliative treatment of inoperable liver malignomas are performed at many centers. A specific concept and an accepted spectrum of indications have to be better defined by prospective trials. Therapeutic decisions in this patient group have to based on the individual case. The interventional radiologists is increasingly involved in the interdisciplinary decision making process.

TI  - Treatment of recurrent transplant renal artery stenosis with metallic stents.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of stent deployment in the treatment of recurrent stenosis of transplant renal arteries (TRAs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study includes six consecutive patients who underwent a mean of 3.66 previous treatments of TRA stenosis per patient before stent implantation (20 angioplasties and two surgical procedures). The endoprostheses were a Wallstent in four patients and a Palmaz stent in two patients. Clinical, laboratory, and duplex scanning follow-up was performed every 6 months after stent placement in all patients. RESULTS: The procedure was a technical success in all patients. At 6 months, mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 179 to 152 mm Hg (P = .018) and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased from 102 to 90 mm Hg (P = .09). Mean serum creatinine level dropped from 269 to 182 mmol/L (P = .03) and the number of antihypertensive drugs per patient decreased from 2.5 to 1.6. At a mean follow-up of 34 months (range, 7-60 months), all TRAs were patent, with a stenosis less than 50% without clinical consequences in one patient. No secondary procedure was necessary. CONCLUSION: Stent placement seems to be an effective treatment of TRA recurrent stenosis. Midterm follow-up shows satisfactory clinical results and TRA patency rates. This technique might be considered as a valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of TRA recurrent stenosis.

TI  - Extending the limits of transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects with the double umbrella device (CardioSEAL).  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report initial findings from a selected group of patients with morphological variations of the atrial septal defect who underwent transcatheter closure with a second generation redesigned double umbrella device. PATIENTS: Two patients with abnormal location of the oval fossa and partial deficiency of the septal rim, three patients with multiple defects, and two patients with a multiperforated aneurysm of the interatrial septum (age range, 3.6-25.5 years). METHODS: Defects were closed with the double umbrella device (CardioSEAL) consisting of two sets of flexible arms (with central and two mid-arm hinges) covered with sewn Dacron patches. The implantation procedure was monitored by transoesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS: The diameter of the defect measured during transoesophageal echocardiography ranged from 7-18 mm and the balloon stretched diameter ranged from 13-21 mm. The size of the devices varied from 28-33 mm and the ratio of device size to defect size varied from 1.6-2.1. Two devices (23 and 28 mm) were chosen in a patient with two separated defects. No complications or serious arrhythmias were observed during implantation or follow up (median, 1.8 months). Residual shunting was trivial in three patients and mild in one patient (inferiorly located additional defect). CONCLUSIONS: To extend the selection critera of an isolated central interatrial defect for transcatheter closure, some modifications of the implantation technique are needed. Using the redesigned double umbrella device, effective closure in patients with multiple or irregularly shaped atrial septal defects was achieved, indicating a broadening of the spectrum of transcatheter closure.

TI  - Interleukin-1beta and interleukin-1alpha may affect the implantation rate of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) affect the implantation rate of patients undergoing IVF-ET. DESIGN: Follicular fluid and serum were obtained on the day of hCG administration, the day of oocyte retrieval, and the day of embryo transfer. SETTING: Cellular immunology laboratory in a research institute, a high technology IVF unit in a medical center, and a university hospital. PATIENT(S): Thirty-three women who were undergoing IVF-ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): IL-1beta and IL-1alpha were measured by specific ELISA and their levels were correlated with the implantation rate. RESULT(S): Classification of IVF-ET patients according to their implantation rate revealed significantly higher amounts of follicular fluid IL-1beta in the implantation versus nonimplantation cycles (68.5+/-24.6 pg/mL versus 20.5+/-13.4 pg/mL); The difference between the level of IL-1alpha in the two groups was not statistically significant(11.6+/-5.1 pg/mL versus 7.3+/-1.9 pg/mL). In parallel, systemic FSH/hMG-dependent IL-1beta and IL-1alpha production was observed in implantation cycles but not in nonimplantation cycles. Statistically significant IL-1beta and IL-1alpha production was observed after administration of hCG. CONCLUSION(S): Gonadotropins used during IVF-ET induce local and systemic production of IL-1beta and IL-1alpha. In addition, the implantation rate for IVF-ET patients who have detectable serum concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-1beta on the day of hCG administration could be higher than the rate for IVF-ET patients who do not have detectable concentrations of these cytokines.

TI  - Leukemia inhibitory factor in human reproduction.  
AB  - PROBLEM: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the interleukin-6 family and has different biological actions in various tissue systems. Although named for its ability to inhibit proliferation of a myeloid leukemic cell line by inducing differentiation, it also regulates the growth and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, primordial germ cells, peripheral neurons, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. LIF is crucial for successful implantation of the embryo in mice. Currently, there is an accumulation of data about the role of LIF in human reproduction. METHOD OF STUDY: This review of the literature and of our studies focuses on the expression, regulation, and effects of LIF in the human endometrium, fallopian tube, and ovarian follicle. RESULTS: Human endometrium expresses LIF in a menstrual cycle-dependent manner. Maximal expression is observed between days 19 and 25 of the menstrual cycle, coinciding with the time of implantation. Various cytokines and growth factors induce endometrial LIF expression in vitro. LIF receptor is expressed in endometrial tissue throughout the menstrual cycle and on human blastocysts in a stage-dependent manner. Affecting the trophoblast differentiation pathway toward the adhesive phenotype, LIF plays a role in implantation. LIF is also expressed and secreted by the epithelial cells of the fallopian tube. Its increased expression in the tubal stromal cell cultures by the inflammatory cytokines suggests a link between salpingitis and ectopic implantation in the tube. The rising follicular fluid LIF level around the time of ovulation indicates that LIF may play a role in ovulatory events, early embryonic development, and implantation. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that LIF may be one of the entities that plays a role in human reproduction.

TI  - The window for embryo transfer in oocyte donation cycles depends on the duration of progesterone therapy.  
AB  - In 192 oocyte donation cycles performed between January 1993 and July 1996, we examined the width of 'the window for embryo transfer' using standard hormonal replacement methods. All transfers were performed within 48 h of insemination. We varied the day of embryo transfer with regard to the initiation of progesterone therapy and, thus, the duration of endometrial exposure to progesterone and analysed the resulting pregnancy rates. Patients were divided into five groups (I-V) and embryo transfers were performed 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 days following initiation of progesterone therapy. The number of pregnancies per transfer cycle achieved in groups I-V were 0 (0%), 3 (12%), 16 (40%), 29 (48.3%), and 10 (20.4%) respectively. The increased pregnancy rate in group III in comparison to group II is statistically significant (P < 0.03). Furthermore, the pregnancy rate in group IV (5 days of progesterone administration before embryo transfer) was significantly higher than in group V (6 days of progesterone administration before embryo transfer; P < 0.005). We also noted that, when embryos were transferred 4 or 5 days after initiation of progesterone therapy, the pregnancy rates were not significantly different between menopausal and cycling recipients (50% vs 43.7%). Our results indicate that the window for embryo transfer is dependent on duration of treatment with progesterone; it begins approximately 48 h after starting progesterone administration and lasts for approximately 4 days. The optimum period for transferring embryos at the 4- to 8-cell stage corresponds to cycle days 18 and 19. Transfers performed on the 17th and 20th days of the cycle can result in successful implantation, although the rates of implantation are highest when transfers are done on days 18 and 19.

TI  - The successful use of pronuclear embryo transfers the day following oocyte retrieval.  
AB  - A retrospective analysis of results from 114 initiated in-vitro fertilization cycles utilizing pronuclear embryo transfer is presented. Patients were unselected for age or infertility criteria, constituted a continuous series and were grouped according to response to stimulation (Group 1, ideal; Group 2, suboptimal) or ovarian reserve (Group 3, poor). At 16-18 h post-insemination, embryos were scored for alignment of pronuclei and nucleoli and the appearance of the cytoplasm, generating an embryo score (ES). Transfers were performed 24-26 h post-insemination using two to six embryos with the highest ES. A corrected score was calculated (total score/number of embryos; CS). A total of 114 initiated cycles resulted in 97 oocyte retrievals with 38 clinical pregnancies (39%; 15% implantation). Pregnancy rates were significantly different between the three groups; 37 pregnancies in Group 1 (55% clinical pregnancy; 20% implantation), none in Group 2 and one in Group 3 (6%; 2% implantation: P < 0.001). The ES of transferred embryos correlated with groups. There was a strong correlation between CS and implantation and delivery rates. CS >15 resulted in a 28% implantation; 65% delivery rate. CS <14 resulted in four pregnancies, one delivered. The data show that oocyte quality and pronuclear embryo morphology are related to implantation and that pronuclear embryos can be successfully selected for embryo transfer.

TI  - Antiphospholipid antibodies and the outcome of pregnancy after the first in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer cycle.  
AB  - Increased antiphospholipid antibody prevalence has been demonstrated by a number of recent studies in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) patients but the potential effects of antiphospholipid antibodies on the different components of the reproductive process and the consideration of whether to test IVF patients for antiphospholipid antibodies are controversial. The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible association between the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (namely the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies), among a series of 21 consecutive IVF patients having a clinical spontaneous abortion after their first embryo transfer. As a control group (n=42), the nearest IVF cycle resulting in an ongoing pregnancy before and after each miscarried IVF cycle (i.e. the closest cycles in temporal relationship to the index cycle) was used. One patient (4.8%) in the study group and two women (4.8%) among controls were seropositive for antiphospholipid antibodies. These low and similar seropositivity rates found in the two groups studied lead us to conclude that antiphospholipid antibodies testing in IVF patients should be considered only in those women having repeated failures of implantation/clinical abortion after embryo transfer but not in an infertile general population reaching an IVF programme.
