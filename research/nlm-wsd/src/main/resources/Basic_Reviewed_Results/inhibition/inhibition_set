TI  - R-flurbiprofen chemoprevention and treatment of intestinal adenomas in the APC(Min)/+ mouse model: implications for prophylaxis and treatment of colon cancer.  
AB  - We used the C57BL/6J-APC(Min)/+ mouse (Min mouse) to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of R-flurbiprofen (R-FB), the noncyclooxygenase-inhibiting enantiomer of FB. Weanling Min mice were administered 6 weeks of oral treatment with R-FB using 2.5-25 mg/kg of R-FB once per day (q.d.), 2.5-10 mg/kg of R-FB twice per day (b.i.d.), and 5 mg/kg of R-FB b.i.d. challenged with a high saturated fat diet. At necropsy we determined tumor and ulcer numbers, tumor size, and plasma levels of R- and S-FB. A linear dose response was observed from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg of R-FB, regardless of whether the drug was administered as a single or divided dose. Reductions in tumor number were significant (P < or = 0.02) for doses of R-FB from 2.5 to 25 mg/kg/day. A dose of 5 mg/kg R-FB b.i.d. was able to overcome the doubling in tumor number associated with the high saturated fat diet. At 20 and 25 mg/kg/day R-FB, we obtained the maximum response with up to 90% inhibition of total tumor number. At these doses, however, there was toxicity and animal deaths. This toxicity was associated with ulceration, presumably resulting from the in vivo epimerization of R- to S-FB that occurs in the mouse. Thus, we evaluated the oral pharmacokinetics of R-FB and its conversion to S-FB in wild-type mice. These kinetics experiments revealed inversion rates of 7.3 and 11.0% for the 2.5 and 10 mg/kg R-FB doses, respectively. S-FB administered alone (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg q.d.), in doses mimicking the concentrations of S-FB associated with the R to S epimerization of the doses of R-FB used in our experiments, had little or no antitumor efficacy (P > 0.05). Thus, we conclude that R-FB itself, not the S-FB resulting from epimerization in the mouse, inhibits adenoma formation in the Min mouse. In humans, where there is no R to S epimerization, it is possible that larger doses of R-FB can be used without causing cyclooxygenase inhibition and its resulting ulcerogenicity and other side effects. To assess the effect of R-FB on established adenomas, we allowed 40 Min mice to remain untreated until 70 days of age (the time of necropsy in the previous experiments) and then treated them for an additional 42 days with 10 mg/kg R-FB q.d. or 5 mg/kg R-FB b.i.d.. Both drug-treated groups demonstrated tumor numbers significantly less than that of the vehicle control (P < 0.01). Our results suggest that prophylaxis and treatment trials of R-FB should be extended to humans.

TI  - B cell activation and Ig, especially IgE, production is inhibited by high CD23 levels in vivo and in vitro.  
AB  - The capacity of CD23 to regulate IgE production was evaluated in both an in vitro and an in vivo system. The decreased IgE response seen in CD23 transgenic mice was confirmed and observed to occur at all antigen doses used. In addition, purified B cells from the Tg animals in general exhibited lower IgE production when stimulated with CD40L and IL-4. To examine this down-regulating activity of CD23 an in vitro model system was developed. CHO cells were transfected with CD23, ICAM-1, or both CD23 and ICAM-1. ICAM-1 was chosen to enhance B cell-B cell interaction. Purified resting B cells were placed into culture with the mitomycin C-treated transfected or control CHO cells and activated with IL-4, IL-5, and CD40L-CHO. A dose-dependent decrease in IgE production was observed with increasing cell numbers of the CHO transfectants that expressed CD23. The effect lasted up to Day 3 of culture. B cell proliferation was also inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by increasing numbers of CD23-expressing cells suggesting a potential effect of CD23 on B cell apoptosis. In contrast, ICAM-1-transfected or CHO control cells had minimal effects on either Ig production or B cell proliferation. While IgE production was inhibited up to 95% by high numbers of CD23-transfected CHO cells, some inhibition of IgG and IgM production was also seen. Finally, the mechanism of CD23-mediated inhibition of IgE production was compared with the inhibition in IgE production seen when B cell were coactivated with multivalent anti-IgD in conjunction with CD40L plus optimal IL-4. To this end we used RT-PCR to compare the relative levels of epsilon-germline transcripts in control cultures and cultures coactivated by anti-IgD, CD40L, and IL-5 or activated in the presence of high levels of CD23-expressing cells. CD22 was used as an internal standard since levels change little with B cell activation. Coactivation strongly inhibited epsilon-germline transcript levels but the presence of CD23-expressing cells did not. Thus, coactivation potentially operates prior to isotype switching, while high CD23 coculture blocks either recombination or more likely B cell differentiation to high Ig producers stage. Our data support the hypothesis that IL-4 induces both IgE and a controlling agent for IgE, namely, CD23.

TI  -  Inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis by nitrate in Gibberella fujikuroi.  
AB  - Gibberellin production in Gibberella fujikuroi starts upon exhaustion of the nitrogen source. To determine the role of nitrate and ammonium in the regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis we have isolated mutants that cannot use nitrate as a nitrogen source. Nitrate inhibited partially the production of gibberellins in mutants devoid of nitrate reductase activity. The inhibition occurred whether nitrate was added before or after the onset of gibberellin production. Addition of tungstate to the wild type mimicked the results with nitrate reductase mutants. We conclude that nitrate inhibits gibberellin biosynthesis by itself, independently of the intracellular signal that conveys nitrogen availability.

TI  - Angiotensin II-receptor blockade further reduces afterload safely in patients maximally treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for heart failure.  
AB  - Combined therapy with an angiotensin-II type I receptor (AT1) antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor results in more complete suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, the blood-pressure response and safety of combining AT1-receptor blockade with losartan for ACE inhibition were evaluated in patients with congestive heart failure who were already treated with maximally recommended or tolerated doses of an ACE inhibitor. Forty-three patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were evaluated biweekly for 1 month before addition of losartan and weekly during administration of losartan at a daily dose of 25 mg for the first week and 50 mg for the second week. Systolic blood pressure, which remained unchanged before addition of losartan, decreased from 122 +/- 18 mm Hg to 112 +/- 17 and 107 +/- 17 mm Hg (p < 0.001) after 1 week of 25 mg and 1 week of 50 mg losartan, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure also significantly decreased. The decreases in blood pressure were well tolerated by all patients, even by those in whom symptomatic hypotension developed during uptitration of ACE inhibition. Serum potassium and sodium and parameters of renal function remained unchanged. Combining AT1-receptor blockade with losartan to maximally recommended or tolerated ACE inhibition appears safe and leads to further vasodilatation in symptomatic patients with congestive heart failure.

TI  - Cytokine-mediated antitumor effect of OK-432 on urinary bladder tumor cells in vitro.  
AB  - Fatal complications from the intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for the treatment of superficial urinary bladder tumors have been reported. OK-432, an immunomodulating agent like BCG, may be an effective and safe agent for the treatment of urinary bladder tumors. We investigated the cytokine-mediated antitumor effect of OK-432 on established human bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and KK-47) in vitro. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy volunteer were cultured with OK-432 for various periods, and the culture supernatants were used as conditioned media. Cytokines in the culture supernatants were quantified. The antitumor effect of OK-432 was evaluated by colony-forming assays, using the conditioned media as the culture media. The colony survival of T24 and KK-47 cells was significantly inhibited by conditioned media from 24-h cultures of PBMCs incubated with OK-432 at concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 Klinische Einheit (KE)/ml. Conditioned media from PBMCs cultivated with OK-432 for 7 days at 0.01 and 0.05 KE/ml also significantly inhibited the colony survival of both cell lines. Higher concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were detected in conditioned media cultivated with OK-432 for 24 h than in media from PBMCs alone. However, higher concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) were detected in conditioned media cultivated with OK-432 for 7 days. Approximately 90% of the inhibition of KK-47 cells by the 24-h conditioned media was neutralized by an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. The inhibition of T24 cells was neutralized approximately 50% by the same antibody. The inhibition of T24 and KK-47 cells by 7-day conditioned media was completely neutralized by an anti-IFN gamma monoclonal antibody. The cultivation of PBMCs with OK-432 inhibited the production of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by PBMCs. The inhibition may play a role in the mechanism of the antitumor effect of OK-432. Urinary bladder tumor cell lines have different sensitivities to cytokines. The cytokines induced by OK-432 vary with the concentration of OK-432 and the culture period. It is suggested that in intravesical instillation of OK-432 for treatment of urinary bladder tumor, the optimal dose and interval of instillation should be considered.

TI  - Dexamethasone suppression test identifies a subset of elderly depressed patients with reduced platelet serotonin transport and resistance to imipramine inhibition of transport.  
AB  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is more common in elderly patients with depression than in younger depressed patients, and glucocorticoids are known to influence serotonergic function. Elderly depressed patients are also reportedly more resistant to therapeutic effects of antidepressants. In the current study, we measured platelet serotonin transporter binding sites and transport function in young and elderly depressed patients and determined the relationship to HPA status as assessed with the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). The density and affinity of transporter molecules showed no differences between young and elderly depressed patients, regardless of DST results. Nevertheless, transporter function showed a substantial interaction of aging with DST: elderly DST suppressors showed a deficit in [3H]serotonin uptake capabilities and resistance to imipramine inhibition of uptake. No such defects were seen in the young depressed cohort, regardless of DST status, nor in elderly depressed DST non-suppressors. These results are consistent with the view that depression in the elderly exhibits basic biological differences from depression in earlier life, and that such distinctions may account in part for therapeutic ineffectiveness of antidepressants in specific subgroups, associated with the presence or absence of appropriate HPA regulation.

TI  - Gastrin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate regulate the human histidine decarboxylase promoter through Raf-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-related signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells.  
AB  - Gastrin stimulates transcription of the human histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene through binding to the G-protein-coupled cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. We have explored the possibility that mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades play a role in mediating the effects of gastrin on transcription in a gastric cancer (AGS-B) cell line. Gastrin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of AGS-B cells was found to increase the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 and increase ERK activity as determined by the in vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Reporter gene assays also demonstrated that gastrin and PMA stimulated Elk-1- and c-Myc-dependent transactivation, consistent with gastrin- and PMA-induced activation of ERKs. Overexpression of wild type ERK-1 and ERK-2 or activation of endogenous ERKs using activated MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or ERK kinase) overexpression stimulated HDC promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion. Interruption of the ERK-related pathway using expression vectors for kinase-deficient ERKs or an ERK-specific phosphatase (PAC-1) blocked gastrin- and PMA-stimulated HDC promoter activity. In contrast, inhibition of the Jun kinase pathway using an interfering dominant negative SEK-1 (stress-activated protein kinase/ERK-1) mutant did not inhibit HDC promoter activity. Furthermore, whereas gastrin stimulated phosphorylation of Shc proteins and association with Grb2, activation of the HDC promoter was not influenced by expression of dominant negative Ras (N15 or N17) proteins. However, gastrin stimulated Raf-1 kinase activity, and activation of the HDC promoter was blocked by coexpression of a dominant negative Raf-1 construct. Overall, these data demonstrate that gastrin regulates HDC transcription in a Rafdependent, Ras-independent fashion predominantly through activation of the ERK-related pathway.

TI  - Prolactin is an autocrine growth factor for the Jurkat human T-leukemic cell line.  
AB  - Despite convincing evidence of cooperation between IL-2 and endogenous prolactin (PRL) during T cell activation, the individual role of PRL as a T-cell lineage cytokine remains to be defined. We have examined the production and function of PRL on the Jurkat human T-leukemic cell line, which does not constitutively produce IL-2. The majority of Jurkat cells expressed PRL receptor (R) under standard culture conditions, whereas appearance of the alpha chain of the IL-2-R required PHA-PMA stimulation, as did IL-2 synthesis. Western blotting revealed a predominant band at 23.5 kDa and a weaker band at 25.5 kDa in both Jurkat cell lysates and human (h) pituitary PRL. Metabolic labeling of the cell lysates with 35S-methionine and immunoprecipitation with an antiserum against hPRL showed that both forms of PRL are actively synthesized by the Jurkat cell line. PRL released in the medium was biologically active in the rat Nb2 lymphoma mitogenic assay. Depletion of medium PRL with two polyclonal anti-hPRL antisera inhibited the growth of Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, as evaluated by cell number and 3H-TdR uptake. Purified pituitary or recombinant hPRL at a wide range of concentrations had no significant effect on their growth, but reversed the blocking activity of the anti-hPRL antibody. Recombinant IL-2 had no effect on the antibody-induced growth inhibition. Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate that PRL can act as an autocrine T cell growth factor independently of IL-2 and are the first evidence of its involvement in human leukemic growth and possibly in leukemic transformation.

TI  - Pretreatment with antibody to eosinophil major basic protein prevents hyperresponsiveness by protecting neuronal M2 muscarinic receptors in antigen-challenged guinea pigs.  
AB  - In antigen-challenged guinea pigs there is recruitment of eosinophils into the lungs and to airway nerves, decreased function of inhibitory M2 muscarinic autoreceptors on parasympathetic nerves in the lungs, and airway hyperresponsiveness. A rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil major basic protein was used to determine whether M2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction, and the subsequent hyperresponsiveness, are due to antagonism of the M2 receptor by eosinophil major basic protein. Guinea pigs were sensitized, challenged with ovalbumin and hyperresponsiveness, and M2 receptor function tested 24 h later with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. Antigen-challenged guinea pigs were hyperresponsive to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves compared with controls. Likewise, loss of M2 receptor function was demonstrated since the agonist pilocarpine inhibited vagally-induced bronchoconstriction in control but not challenged animals. Pretreatment with rabbit antibody to guinea pig eosinophil major basic protein prevented hyperresponsiveness, and protected M2 receptor function in the antigen-challenged animals without inhibiting eosinophil accumulation in the lungs or around the nerves. Thus, hyperresponsiveness is a result of inhibition of neuronal M2 muscarinic receptor function by eosinophil major basic protein in antigen-challenged guinea pigs.

TI  -  Specific inhibition of Stat3 signal transduction by PIAS3.  
AB  - The signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) protein is activated by the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, epidermal growth factor, and leptin. A protein named PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) that binds to Stat3 was isolated and characterized. The association of PIAS3 with Stat3 in vivo was only observed in cells stimulated with ligands that cause the activation of Stat3. PIAS3 blocked the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 and inhibited Stat3-mediated gene activation. Although Stat1 is also phosphorylated in response to IL-6, PIAS3 did not interact with Stat1 or affect its DNA-binding or transcriptional activity. The results indicate that PIAS3 is a specific inhibitor of Stat3.

TI  - Effects of short and long term ethanol on the activation of signal transducer and activator transcription factor 3 in normal and regenerating liver.  
AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced activation of Signal Transducer and Activator Transcription Factor 3 (Stat3) is a critical step in liver regeneration. Chronic ethanol consumption is known to increase the plasma concentration of IL-6, yet the ability of the liver to regenerate and the regenerative induction of several IL-6 initiated events are impaired in chronic alcoholic liver disease. We hypothesized that chronic ethanol consumption inhibits IL-6 dependent signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, the effect of ethanol on the Stat3 signal transduction pathway was studied in the adult rat liver. In vitro treatment of freshly isolated normal adult rat hepatocytes with 50-100 mM ethanol for 30 min blocked IL-6-induced Stat3 activation. Long-term ethanol intake in vivo significantly attenuated the activation of Stat3 induced either in vivo by partial hepatectomy or in vitro by IL-6. In contrast, short-term ethanol consumption enhanced the regenerative induction of Stat3 but inhibited IL-6 induced Stat3 activation. These data suggest that the inhibition of liver regeneration by chronic ethanol consumption is, at least in part, mediated by modulating the activation of Stat3.

AB  - To determine whether the inhibition of human osteoblast growth mediated by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25(OH)D3) occurs as a result of changes in transforming growth factor (TGF) and TGF receptor synthesis, we examined the effects of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 on the synthesis of TGF beta and TGF-beta receptors. Treatment with 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, but not vehicle, increased TGF-beta 2 concentrations in human osteoblast cell supernantants in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase in TGF-beta 2 concentrations was associated with an inhibition of osteoblast cell growth; antibodies directed against transforming growth factor beta partially blocked the inhibition of cellular growth mediated by 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 TGF-beta 2 gene transcription and TGF-beta 2 mRNA concentrations were increased in 1 alpha,25(OH)D3 but not in vehicle-treated cells. 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 increased TGF-beta type I and type II receptor mRNA levels in osteoblasts. Increased expression of TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta receptors by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 might account for the inhibition of human osteoblast growth seen following 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment.

TI  - Influence of extracellular K+ concentration on the time-course of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition by cardiac glycosides with fast and low binding kinetics.  
AB  - The magnitude of the K+ antagonism of cardiac glycoside binding to Na+/K+-ATPase prepared from porcine heart, was estimated from the enzyme activities determined in the presence of different concentrations of K+ ([K+]), ouabain, and alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin-glucoside, the latter showing a 30 fold greater dissociation rate than ouabain. An increase of [K+] (3-20 mmol/l) prolonged the half-lives of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition and caused a rightward shift of the cardiac glycoside's dose-response curves by the same factor, almost maximal (4 fold) at 14 mmol/l K+. These data could be verified from the cardiac glycoside-elevated intravesicular Na+ concentrations of rat brain vesicles. These concentrations declined rapidly in brain vesicles treated with alpha-methyl-digitoxigenin-glucoside but not with ouabain after K+ was increased from 3.5 to 14 mM. The results suggest that the magnitude of the K+ antagonism under physiological conditions is only limited by the lifespan of the cardiac glycoside-binding E2P enzyme conformation reduced by K+.

TI  - Development of membrane properties in taste cells of fungiform papillae: functional evidence for early presence of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels.  
AB  - Behavioral and physiological studies have demonstrated a reduced sensitivity to several taste stimuli early in development. It has been suggested that this reduced sensitivity results from a late maturation of underlying transduction mechanisms. Little is known, however, about maturation of membrane properties of taste cells early in development. We have obtained whole-cell recordings from single fungiform taste cells of rat pups to examine the development of the NaCl transduction system. Although taste buds undergo a considerable increase in size during development, membrane capacitance measurements revealed no change in membrane surface area of individual taste cells, suggesting that the increase in size results from an increase in the total number of cells per bud. Whole-cell recordings showed that taste cells from very young pups [postnatal day 2 (PND2)] already possessed voltage-activated Na+ and K+ currents with no apparent differences in size or kinetics compared with adults. Surprisingly, amiloride-sensitive Na+ responses, important for Na+ transduction, were found as early as PND2. The magnitude of responses to amiloride and the percentage of amiloride-sensitive cells remained the same throughout all age groups. Furthermore, the similarity of amiloride inhibition constants suggested that the channel in neonates is the same channel that is expressed in adult taste buds. Our results indicate that taste cells at PND2 already have acquired the transduction elements necessary for signaling NaCl responses to the afferent nerve. We hypothesize that complete functionality of the salt taste transduction system, however, may not be reached until amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels become selectively localized at the apical membrane. This would explain previous studies indicating that amiloride sensitivity cannot be detected before PND12 in the intact tongue. Apical clustering of channels along with the opening of the taste pore and an increase in the total number of taste cells per bud likely constitute additional important steps toward a fully functional sensory system.

We hypothesized that a dominant-negative mutation in the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene would inhibit transcription of all genes by blocking access of the wild-type enzyme to promoters. An evolutionarily invariant lysine was substituted with arginine by site-directed mutagenesis in the rpoB gene. The dominant-negative rpoB gene product inhibited a transposon-derived kanamycin-resistance gene in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Rv, leading to growth inhibition of the mycobacteria on solid media containing kanamycin. The dominant-negative mutant rpoB gene is a potential suicide gene especially for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis once a delivery strategy is also developed.

TI  - Ovarian function of pygmy marmoset daughters (Cebuella pygmaea) in intact and motherless families.  
AB  - Reproductive inhibition of subordinate Callitrichid group members has been shown to vary with genus; whereas female Leontopithecus subordinates have normal ovarian cycles and occasionally breed within groups, subordinate Saguinus females almost never do so, with Callithrix species showing intermediate levels of reproductive inhibition. No information has been available on patterns of reproduction or inhibition in subordinate females in the genus Cebuella. We assessed fertility in Cebuella pygmaea daughters to allow comparison with the remaining Callitrichid genera. Specifically, the project had two goals: 1) to determine if there was evidence of reproductive inhibition of daughters living in family groups, and 2) to compare the ovarian function of daughters living in intact family groups with that of daughters residing in motherless families (i.e., without the breeding female). We collected daily urine samples for 6-8 weeks from eight pygmy marmoset daughters living in intact family groups or motherless families. Determination of ovulatory cycling or reproductive quiescence depended on the hormonal profiles generated from urinary luteinizing hormone and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide concentrations. All females in the motherless condition (aged 13-30 months) (n = 4) ovulated during the study. In contrast, only one of four daughters (aged 13-20 months) residing in intact families was found to be cycling. Data from motherless groups indicate ovarian cycling may begin between 15 and 17 months of age.  Reproductive inhibition occurs in pygmy marmosets, although in a pattern more similar to Callithrix than to other Callitrichid genera.

TI  - The Na+-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio alginolyticus--redox states of the FAD prosthetic group and mechanism of Ag+ inhibition.  
AB  - The FAD prosthetic group of the Na+-motive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) from Vibrio alginolyticus was investigated by ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The reduction of Na+-NQR by excess NADH in the presence of 6-13 microM O2 resulted in the formation of the blue flavosemiquinone radical. If the concentration of dioxygen was further reduced to 0.1 microM O2, neither the reduction of Na+-NQR by NADH nor its reoxidation with ubiquinone-1 (Q-1) yielded a stable flavosemiquinone in equilibrium with reductant or oxidant, respectively, but the fully reduced (Fl(red)H2) or oxidized flavin (Fl(ox)) prevailed. During reoxidation of Fl(red)H2 with Q-1, the intermediate formation of an absorbance band around 800 nm was observed, which was tentatively assigned as the Fl(red)H(-)-NAD+ charge-transfer complex. Complete reoxidation of Fl(red)H2 in Na+-NQR was achieved by a fivefold excess of Q-1 over NADH. These results indicated that only a small fraction of FAD was in the flavosemiquinone redox state during turnover to mediate the electron transfer between the hydride donor, NADH, and the one-electron acceptor [2Fe-2S]. The titration of Na+-NQR with Ag+, a specific inhibitor, was followed by the fluorescence emission spectra of FAD (Fl(ox)). The addition of Ag+ resulted in a marked increase of the flavin fluorescence (16% at 200 nM Ag+), with half-maximal saturation at approximately 50 nM Ag+, indicating dissociation of FAD from the enzyme. The increase in fluorescence intensity correlated with the loss of enzyme activity. Gel filtration of the Ag+-treated Na+-NQR confirmed that FAD had been displaced from the holo-enzyme.

TI  - Peroxynitrite modulates tyrosine-dependent signal transduction pathway of human erythrocyte band 3.  
AB  - Peroxynitrite, the product of the reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide anion, is able to nitrate protein tyrosines. If this modification occurs on phosphotyrosine kinase substrates, it can down-regulate cell signaling. We investigated the effects of peroxynitrite on band 3-mediated signal transduction of human erythrocytes. Peroxynitrite treatment induced two different responses. At low concentrations (10-100 microM) it stimulated a metabolic response, leading to 1) a reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, 2) a rise of tyrosine phosphorylation in the 22K cytoplasmic domain of band 3, 3) the release of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the membrane, and 4) the enhancement of lactate production. At high concentrations (200-1000 microM), peroxynitrite induced 1) cross-linking of membrane proteins, 2) inhibition of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation, 3) nitration of tyrosines in the 22K cytoplasmic domain of band 3, 4) binding of hemoglobin to the membrane, 5) irreversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine kinase activity, 6) massive methemoglobin production, and 7) irreversible inhibition of lactate production. Our results demonstrate that at concentrations that could conceivably be achieved in vivo (10-100 microM), peroxynitrite behaves like other oxidants, i.e., it stimulates band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and increases glucose metabolism. Thus, one plausible physiologic effect of peroxynitrite is the up-regulation of signaling through the reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. At high concentrations of peroxynitrite, the tyrosine phosphorylation ceases in parallel with the nitration of band 3 tyrosines, but at these concentrations phosphotyrosine kinase activity and glycolysis are also irreversibly inhibited. Thus, at least in red blood cells, the postulated down-regulation of signaling by peroxynitrite cannot merely be ascribed to the nitration of tyrosine kinase targets.

TI  - Inhibition of shear stress-induced platelet aggregation by cilostazol, a specific inhibitor of cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase, in vitro and ex vivo.  
AB  - Cilostazol(6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-butoxy]-3,4- dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone) selectively inhibits cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE3) and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by various agonists. Effect of cilostazol on shear stress-induced human platelet aggregation (SIPA) was examined in vitro and ex vivo. Cilostazol inhibited SIPA dose-dependently in vitro. The IC50 value of cilostazol for inhibition of SIPA was 15 +/- 2.6 microM (m +/- SE, n=5), which was very similar to that (12.5 +/- 2.1 microM) for inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Cilostazol potentiates the inhibition of SIPA by PGE1 and enhances its ability to increase cAMP concentrations. A single oral adminstration of 100 mg cilostazol to healthy volunteers produced a significant inhibition of SIPA. This study demonstrates that cilostazol is an effective inhibitor of SIPA, which may be important for the prevention and the treatment of arterial occlusive diseases.

TI  - The importance of enzyme inhibition kinetics for the effect of thrombin inhibitors in a rat model of arterial thrombosis.  
AB  - The relation between the antithrombotic effect in vivo, and the inhibition constant (Ki) and the association rate constant (k(on)) in vitro was investigated for eight different thrombin inhibitors. The carotid arteries of anaesthetized rats were exposed to FeCl3 for 1 h, and the thrombus size was determined from the amount of incorporated 125I-fibrinogen. The thrombin inhibitors were given intravenously, and complete concentration- and/or dose-response curves were constructed. Despite a 50,000-fold difference between the Ki-values comparable plasma concentrations of hirudin and melagatran were needed (0.14 and 0.12 micromol l(-1), respectively) to obtain a 50% antithrombotic effect (IC50) in vivo. In contrast, there was a comparable in vitro (Ki-value) and in vivo (IC50) potency ratio for melagatran and inogatran, respectively. These results can be explained by the concentration of thrombin in the thrombus and improved inhibition by the low-molecular-weight compounds. For all eight thrombin inhibitors tested, there was an inverse relationship between k(on)-values in vitro and the slope of the dose response curves in vivo. Inhibitors with k(on)-values of < 1 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) gave steep dose response curves with a Hill coefficient > 1. The association time for inhibition of thrombin for slow-binding inhibitors will be too long to give effective antithrombotic effects at low plasma concentrations, but at increasing concentrations the association time will decrease, resulting in a steeper dose-response curve and thereby a more narrow therapeutic interval.

Using an alkaline buffer system with the addition of non-ionic or zwitterionic detergent and high sensitivity laser-induced fluorescence detection, both slowly and rapidly equilibrating binding could be demonstrated. This was accomplished using a pre-equilibration approach as well as migration shift experiments where receptor molecules were added to the electrophoresis buffer.

TI  - [Mechanism mediating hypertension induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis]  
AB  - Although the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is known to induce systemic hypertension, the underlying mechanisms mediating this type of hypertension are incompletely understood. In the present study we investigated the influence of sodium intake on the pressor effect of long-term administration of the NO synthesis inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 16 mg/dl in drinking fluid for 8 weeks), in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. Urinary excretion rates of catecholamine during NO synthesis inhibition were also examined. Long-term administration of L-NAME produced a sustained elevation in tail-cuff pressure without altering urine flow, or sodium excretion rate. L-NAME-induced hypertension was accompanied by a decreased urinary excretion of the stable NO metabolites, NO2- and NO3-, and was aggravated when rats drank 0.9% saline in place of tap water. Thus, inhibition of NO synthesis resulted in a rightward shift of the pressure natriuresis relationship and a significant decrease in the slope of this relationship. Urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, but not that of dopamine, in L-NAME-treated rats significantly increased within the first week of the study when compared with those observed in control rats. A natriuretic index of the sympathetic nervous system, the ratio of dopamine to norepinephrine excretion, was significantly less in L-NAME-treated rats than in control rats. After 8-week treatment with L-NAME, renal morphologic evaluation revealed significant narrowing and obliteration of the arterioles. L-arginine (2 g/dl in drinking fluid) completely reversed the elevation of blood pressure as well as the decrease in urinary NO2- and NO3- excretion and the increased urinary excretion of catecholamines associated with L-NAME treatment after 3 weeks of concomitant administration. These results suggest that the inhibition of chronic NO synthesis produces sodium-sensitive hypertension and that changes in sympathetic nerve activity may, at least in part, contribute to the sodium sensitivity in this type of hypertension.

TI  - Biochemical and pharmacological characterization of FK706, a novel elastase inhibitor.  
AB  - FK706, sodium 2-[4-[[(S)-1-[[(S)-2-[[(RS)-3, 3, 3-trifluoro-1-isopropyl-2-oxopropyl]aminocarbonyl]pyrrolidin -1-yl]carbonyl]-2-methylpropyl] aminocarbonyl] benzoylamino] acetate, C26H32F3N4NaO7, is a synthetic water-soluble inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase. This compound demonstrated a competitive and slow-binding inhibition of human neutrophil elastase with a Ki of 4.2 nM. In studies using synthetic substrates, FK706 inhibited human neutrophil elastase activity and porcine pancreatic elastase activity with respective IC50 values of 83 and 100 nM. FK706, however, inhibited more weakly, (IC50 values > 340 microM) other serine proteinases such as human pancreatic alpha-chymotrypsin, human pancreatic trypsin and human leukocyte cathepsin G. FK706 also effectively inhibited the hydrolysis of bovine neck ligament elastin (2 mg/ml final concentration) by human neutrophil elastase (4 microg/ml final concentration) with an IC50 value of 230 nM. FK706 protected animals against human neutrophil elastase (50 microg/animal)-induced lung hemorrhage with ED50 values of 2.4 microg/animal by intratracheal administration and 36.5 mg/kg by intravenous administration, respectively. Subcutaneous administration of FK706 significantly suppressed human neutrophil elastase (20 microg/paw)-induced paw edema in mice in a dose-dependent manner (47% inhibition at a dose of 100 mg/kg). These results suggest that FK706 would be a useful tool for investigating the role of human neutrophil elastase in inflammatory disorders associated with an excess of elastase, such as pulmonary emphysema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Long chain analogs of physostigmine as potential drugs for Alzheimer's disease: new insights into the mechanism of action in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.  
AB  - Heptylphysostigmine is in advanced clinical trial as a drug for Alzheimer's disease. 8-Morpholinooctylphysostigmine and 8-(cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)octylphysostigmine are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation. The mechanism of action of these compounds in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase has been investigated. All the examined compounds display non competitive-like kinetics of inhibition. There are no reversible components in the observed inhibition: the whole inhibitory effect is due to the time-dependent pseudo-irreversible carbamylation of the active site. Yet the observed time course of the inhibition does not match a simple second order kinetics. An influence of the quaternary structure of the enzyme on the more complex kinetics of carbamylation is hypothesized. Reactivation experiments on the inhibited enzyme show long lasting inhibitory effects for these compounds. The higher duration of the anticholinesterase effect of the morpholino derivatives compared to heptylphysostigmine should provide the basis for their higher therapeutic potential.

TI  - Excessive prolongation of the bleeding time by aspirin in essential thrombocythemia is related to a decrease of large von Willebrand factor multimers in plasma.  
AB  - Patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), who frequently have bleeding complications, may manifest an excessive prolongation of the bleeding time (BT) after ingestion of aspirin (ASA). The reason for this excessive prolongation of the BT is unknown, but it is attributed to qualitative platelet defects. Since patients with ET may also have acquired abnormalities of plasma and platelet von Willebrand factor (vWF), we questioned whether the excessive prolongation of the BT by ASA was related to changes in either plasma or platelet vWF. To that end, we studied BT and plasma and platelet vWF in ten ET patients, ten patients with reactive thrombocytosis (RT), and ten normal individuals, both before and after administration of 500 mg ASA for 7 days. In a second study, the effect of DDAVP infusion on plasma vWF in relation to the BT was studied in ten normal individuals and ten ET patients after treatment with 100 mg ASA for 3 days. In the first study, treatment with ASA resulted in a significant prolongation of the BT in normal subjects, RT patients, and ET patients. However, in five ET patients an excessive (> 2 SD) prolongation of the BT by ASA was observed. Although ASA induced no direct changes in either plasma or platelet vWF levels in either normal subjects, RT patients, or ET patients, all five ET patients who showed an excessive prolongation of the BT by ASA had significantly decreased levels of large vWF multimers in plasma. In the second study, infusion with DDAVP resulted in a significant increase in plasma large vWF multimers, paralleled by a normalization of (excessively) prolonged BT. Our data suggest that in ET inhibition of platelet function by ASA in the presence of concurrently decreased levels of large vWF multimers in plasma may have provoked the excessive BT prolongation.

In three culture media the enzymatic activity was lower than 0.035 pU/cell/h. In five others (in a hepatoma cell line and in four metastasis-derived cell lines) the activity was higher than 0.057 pU/cell/h. A tumour-derived fibroblast culture was negative. The optimal activity was observed at a pH comprised between 3.6 and 4.  Salt inhibition of hyaluronidase was reversible. The enzyme was denaturated by a 10-min heating at 70 degrees C. The enzyme was not strictly specific for hyaluronan hydrolysis but also digested chondroitin sulfates. PH20, a spermatozoid protein that has homologies with the bee venom hyaluronidase, was not expressed by cell lines tested.

TI  - D-glucose but not insulin reduces N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe)-induced shape changes in suspended human neutrophils.  
AB  - The effects of glucose (5-25 mM) and insulin concentration (40-320 microU/ml) on the cell shape of neutrophil granulocytes from healthy humans were studied. Both non-activated and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe)-activated neutrophils in suspension were used as a model for initial chemotactic activation of neutrophil locomotion. D-glucose, but not the non-metabolizable analogue 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, dose-dependently reduced the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced (10(-8)M) neutrophil elongation. Insulin, either alone or in combination with 25 mM D-glucose, was without effect on the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced neutrophil elongation. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of D-glucose was observed already after 1 min of exposure to D-glucose and fMet-Leu-Phe. D-glucose diminished the fraction of neutrophils with elongated locomotor shape by changing it into an irregular cell shape, suggesting that at least part of the D-glucose effect could be associated with mechanisms determining the typical locomotor shape. The present results suggest that D-glucose through its metabolism, but without the involvement of insulin, reduces chemotactically induced elongation to a locomotor neutrophil shape, and thus neutrophil motility, and that this effect of glucose appears prior to adhesion.  This glucose-induced inhibition of the neutrophil chemotactic response may be involved in the neutrophil deficiency seen in diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Comparison of a radioallergosorbent (RAST) inhibition method and a monoclonal enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for aeroallergen measurement.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mouse and rat urinary proteins are potent occupational allergens for exposed personnel. Methods of measuring airborne allergens differ greatly, and reported levels of allergens vary considerably between laboratories. OBJECTIVES: To compare the values obtained using two different methods of allergen detection. METHODS: Air samples were collected in rat rooms in Sweden and the United Kingdom at 2 L/min on to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters and extracted in buffer containing 0.5% v/v Tween 20. Airborne rat urinary allergen (RUA) was measured in all samples by both RAST inhibition using a polyclonal human serum pool (UK) and a two monoclonal antibody sandwich ELISA employing antibodies specific for Rat n 1.02 (alpha2u-globulin) (Sweden). RESULTS: The two methods gave values which were correlated (r2 log values = 0.72, P<0.0001), but differed by several orders of magnitude (median [range] ratio of RAST inhibition/ELISA = 316 [7-26(80)]. There was a systematic bias: as the absolute values increased, the difference in the measurements increased. The rat urine standards used were antigenically similar. CONCLUSIONS: A large contrast in RUA values obtained from the two assays was observed in this study. This may be primarily due to methodological differences, but variations in antibody specificities or composition of allergenic epitopes in the air samples may contribute. The results demonstrate that standardization of methods and antibodies is necessary before interlaboratory comparisons can be made.

TI  - Preconditioning in rat hearts is independent of mitochondrial F1F0 ATPase inhibition.  
AB  - Mitochondrial F1F0 adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) is responsible for the majority of ATP synthesis during normoxic conditions, but under ischemic conditions it accounts for significant ATP hydrolysis. A previous study showed that preconditioning in isolated rat hearts is mediated by inhibition of this ATPase during ischemia. We tested this hypothesis in our isolated rat heart model of preconditioning. Preconditioning was accomplished by three 5-min periods of global ischemia separated by 5 min of reperfusion. This was followed by 20 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Preconditioning significantly enhanced reperfusion contractile function and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release but paradoxically reduced the time to onset of contracture during global ischemia. Myocardial ATP was depleted at a faster rate during the prolonged ischemia in preconditioned than in sham-treated hearts, which is consistent with the reduced time to contracture. ATP during reperfusion was repleted more rapidly in preconditioned hearts, which is consistent with their enhanced contractile function. Preconditioning significantly reduced lactate accumulation during the prolonged ischemia. We were not able to demonstrate that mitochondrial F1F0 ATPase (measured in submitochondrial particles) was inhibited by preconditioning before or during the prolonged ischemia. The mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin significantly conserved ATP during ischemia and increased the time to the onset of contracture, which is consistent with inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase. Our results show that preconditioning in rat hearts can be independent of mitochondrial ATPase inhibition as well as ATP conservation.

TI  - Inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia in P-selectin- and ICAM-1-deficient mice.  
AB  - Adhesion molecule expression by pulmonary endothelial cells is considered to play an important role in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation in the lung. We have used P-selectin- and intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM-1)-deficient mice to determine whether these adhesion molecules are important to pulmonary eosinophil recruitment after allergen challenge. There was a significant inhibition of lung tissue eosinophil recruitment in ICAM-1-deficient mice (approximately 84% inhibition compared to wild-type mice) and P-selectin-deficient mice (approximately 67% inhibition compared to wild-type mice) 3 h after allergen challenge. The number of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophils in P-selectin-deficient and ICAM-1-deficient mice was also significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice. Levels of BAL eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) were significantly lower in ICAM-1-deficient mice (0.21 +/- 0.03 EPO units) compared with wild-type mice (3.34 +/- 0.65 EPO units). There was no significant difference in the degree of inhibition of eosinophil recruitment in ICAM-1-deficient mice at the three time points (3, 12, and 24 h) of study after allergen challenge. However, in P-selectin-deficient mice there was a decline in the degree of inhibition of eosinophil recruitment from 3 h (67% inhibition) and 12 h (72% inhibition) postchallenge, to 24 h postchallenge (38% inhibition), suggesting that other adhesion molecules may be playing a more prominent role than P-selectin at later time points. These studies suggest an important role for ICAM-1 and P-selectin in eosinophil recruitment to the lung after allergen challenge.

TI  - Progesterone blockade of a luteinizing hormone surge blocks luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone Fos activation and activation of its preoptic area afferents.  
AB  - Progesterone is capable of facilitating or blocking the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, depending on the timing of its administration. However, the precise targets of progesterone's actions are unknown. Since recent studies described the presence of a periventricular preoptic area (pePOA) neuron population afferent to LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons that is co-activated to express c-Fos with LHRH neurons at the time of the LH surge, the present study was designed to determine if the pePOA neurons contain progesterone receptors (PRs) and whether progesterone inhibition is manifested by a failure of LHRH and pePOA neurons to become activated at the time of an LH surge. For progesterone facilitation, a group of immature rats each received a silastic capsule (1.57 mm i.d., 3.18 mm o.d., 1.5 cm long) containing estradiol-17beta (E2) in peanut oil (150 microg/ml) at 09.00 h on postnatal day 28 followed 24 h later by a progesterone implant (crystalline, 1.57 mm i.d., 3.18 mm o.d., 1.5 cm long). For progesterone inhibition, a second group of rats received the estrogen capsule and a progesterone capsule (3.35 mm i.d., 4.65 mm o.d., 3.0 cm long) together at 09.00 h on day 28, and 24 h later received only a blank capsule. On the afternoon of postnatal day 29, all animals were anesthetized and perfused for localization of c-Fos and LHRH, PRs alone, or c-Fos and PRs. The present studies determined that following a progesterone-inhibition paradigm, along with blockade of the LH surge, both activation of LHRH and pePOA neurons was low or absent. Staining of PRs in progesterone-facilitated and progesterone-inhibited rats indicated that the pePOA neurons contained PRs in similar patterns. Double labeling of c-Fos and PRs in progesterone-facilitated rats indicated that nearly all the c-Fos-positive neurons of the pePOA (80 +/- 4.2%) co-expressed PRs; in progesterone-inhibited rats, only 32 +/- 12% of few c-Fos-positive neurons also contained PRs. In no instance were LHRH neurons found to contain PRs. Taken together, these data suggest that both progesterone facilitation and inhibition likely involve direct actions of progesterone on the pePOA neurons, and are consistent with a role for the pePOA neurons in transducing steroid effects on LHRH neurons.

TI  - Novel phosphoserine phosphatase inhibitors.  
AB  - Phosphoserine phosphatase (EC 3.1.1.3) catalyzes the final step in the major pathway of L-serine biosynthesis in brain. This enzyme may also regulate the levels of glycine and D-serine, the known and putative co-agonists for the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in caudal and rostral brain regions, respectively. Using L-phosphoserine as substrate, the rank order potency for inhibition of phosphoserine phosphatase was p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (CMPSA) > glycerophosphorylcholine >> hexadecylphosphocholine > or = phosphorylcholine > N-ethylmaleimide > or = L-serine > fluoride > D-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (D-AP3). Glycerylphosphorylcholine (IC50 18 microM) was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of phosphoserine phosphatase. Glycerylphosphorylcholine probably binds a novel site on the enzyme since the known allosteric inhibitor L-serine is highly selective for its feedback regulatory site, indicated by the inactivity of 25 L-serine analogs. Fluoride ion (IC50 770 microM) may bind the active site as has been shown for other Mg2+-dependent enzymes. The sulfhydryl reagent CMPSA is a potent, noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme using L-phosphoserine as substrate (IC50 9 microM) but is > 300-fold less potent using D-phosphoserine as substrate. Substrate-dependent differences are also observed with the sulfhydryl alkylator N-ethylmaleimide, which inhibits L-phosphoserine, but stimulates D-phosphoserine hydrolysis. These sulfhydryl reagents may dissociate multimeric forms of the enzyme to form monomers; the multimeric forms and monomers may preferentially cleave L- and D-phosphoserine, respectively. Phosphorylcholine esters and sulfhydryl reagents may prove useful in determining the contribution of phosphoserine phosphatase to the biosynthesis of glycine and D-serine in neuronal tissue in vitro.

TI  - Pharmacological effects of SB 220025, a selective inhibitor of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, in angiogenesis and chronic inflammatory disease models.  
AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases often are accompanied by intense angiogenesis, supporting the destructive proliferation of inflammatory tissues. A model of inflammatory angiogenesis is the murine air pouch granuloma, which has a hyperangiogenic component. In this model, we explored the regulation of inflammatory angiogenesis using SB 220025, a specific inhibitor of human p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, with an IC50 value of 60 nM and 50- to 1000-fold selectivity vs. other kinases tested. In vivo, this compound reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumor necrosis factor at an ED50 value of 7.5 mg/kg. In the inflammatory angiogenesis model, over the course of granuloma development, we observed elevated levels of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha during the chronic inflammatory phase when intense angiogenesis occurs. SB 220025 at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. p.o. was able to greatly reduce the expression of these cytokines and inhibit angiogenesis by approximately 40%. To further study the effects of p38/CSBP MAP kinase inhibition in angiogenesis-dependent chronic inflammatory disease, SB 220025 was tested in murine collagen-induced arthritis. In this model, SB 220025 was able to prevent the progression of established arthritis. Thus, this p38/CSBP MAP kinase inhibitor, which can reduce inflammatory cytokine production and inhibit angiogenesis, is an effective treatment for chronic proliferative inflammatory disease.

TI  - Comparison of catalase in diploid and haploid Rana rugosa using heat and chemical inactivation techniques.  
AB  - The present study examines differences in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detoxifying enzyme, catalase, found in the tails and livers of diploid and haploid Rana rugosa. Investigative techniques include measurement of catalase activity and tests for temperature stability and chemical inhibition. Catalase from the tails of pre-climactic (stage XXIII) haploids was found to be over three times as H2O2 destructive as catalase from similar tails of diploids. Catalase from the livers of newly metamorphosed (stage XXV) froglets, on the other hand, displayed only one third the activity seen in diploid livers. The catalase in haploid tail and liver proved to be more heat resistant, retaining 40-60% of its original activity after 5 min of treatment at 55 degrees C, whereas diploid catalase was totally inactivated under the same conditions. Haploid and diploid catalase also responded differently to inhibition using urea and aminotriazole. These differences suggest that haploid catalase has diverged from normal diploid catalase through molecular modification, resulting in abnormal systems for H2O2 metabolism, which in turn are thought to be responsible for organ dysfunction and early death seen in haploid individuals.

TI  - Neurogenic vasodilatation and plasma leakage in the skin.  
AB  - 1. Primary afferent nerve fibers control cutaneous blood flow and vascular permeability by releasing vasoactive peptides. These vascular reactions and the additional recruitment of leukocytes are commonly embodied in the term neurogenic inflammation. 2. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) acting via CGRP1 receptors is the principal transmitter of neurogenic dilatation of arterioles whereas substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) acting via NK1 receptors mediate the increase in venular permeability. 3. Neurogenic vasodilatation and plasma protein leakage play a role in inflammation because many inflammatory and immune mediators including interleukin-1 beta, nitric oxide, prostanoids, protons, bradykinin, histamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine can stimulate peptidergic afferent nerve fibers or enhance their excitability. 4. Neurogenic inflammatory reactions can be suppressed by alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, histamine acting via H1 receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine acting via 5-HT1B receptors, opioid peptides, and somatostatin through prejunctional inhibition of peptide release from vasoactive afferent nerve fibers. CGRP, SP, and NKA receptor antagonists are powerful pharmacological tools to inhibit neurogenic inflammation at the postjunctional level. 5. Imbalance between the facilitatory and inhibitory influences on afferent nerve activity has a bearing on chronic inflammatory disease. Impaired nerve function represents a deficit in skin homeostasis while neuronal overactivity is a factor in allergic and hyperreactive disorders of the skin.

TI  - Effects of chronic nicotine ingestion on pressor response to Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and ex vivo concentration and relaxation response of aorta to L-arginine.  
AB  - Effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibition on blood vessels were studied in nicotine-treated rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats drank a nicotine solution with a concentration of 25 or 50 microg/ml for 15 days. The blood pressure and heart rate of chloralose-anaesthetized rats and isolated aortic strip contractions were measured. NomegaNitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertension was significantly reduced after chronic nicotine treatment. The Emax of contractions of isolated aortic strips to noradrenaline were dose-dependently enhanced by nicotine and the potentiation was abolished by L-arginine. The relaxation of aortic strips to acetylcholine was significantly decreased in nicotine-treated rats, whereas L-arginine, but not D-arginine, reversed this action. Neither nicotine nor L-NAME affected the heart rate. The results show that chronic nicotine treatment reduced the pressor response of L-NAME. Copyright 1997 The Italian Pharmacological Society.

TI  - P-glycoprotein transporters and the gastrointestinal tract: evaluation of the potential in vivo relevance of in vitro data employing talinolol as model compound.  
AB  - Among the different application routes peroral administration remains the one most widely used. Hence, mechanisms affecting p.o. bioavailability are of particular interest, also in drug development. In recent years, intestinal drug secretion mediated by the multi-drug resistance gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been discovered as a possible mechanism of low and erratic bioavailability. Due to the saturability of this process, a dose-dependent apparent oral clearance may be observed which decreases upon increasing dose. However, in vivo intestinal secretion might be revealed only in the lower or subtherapeutic dose range. In permeability studies with Caco-2 cell monolayers, the MDR-reversing agent verapamil inhibits secretion of P-glycoprotein substrates and, hence, increases apical-to-basolateral permeability. The aim of the rat studies with talinolol presented here was to test the relevance of the intestinal secretion process as well as the extent of inhibition by verapamil in ex vivo, in situ, and in vivo talinolol/verapamil drug-drug interaction studies. Intestinal secretion of talinolol was detected indirectly in ex vivo studies via transport inhibition with verapamil and directly in in situ intestinal perfusions in rats following a talinolol i.v. bolus. Both i.v. and p.o. verapamil appear to affect the concentration-time profiles of talinolol. Relevant observations with respect to drug absorption are the decreased apparent oral clearance upon verapamil coadministration as well as the decreased tmax and mean absorption times at high verapamil doses. Talinolol may be regarded as a potential model compound for mechanistic studies on Pgp interactions, including permeability as well as binding studies and the involvement of transporters other than Pgp.

TI  - Mechanotransduction and intracellular signaling mechanisms of stretch-induced remodeling in endothelial cells.  
AB  - We investigated the signaling mechanism of stretch-induced cell remodeling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Freshly dissociated HUVECs were cultured on an elastic silicon membrane and subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch (20% in length, 1 Hz). The cells started to change their morphology as early as 15 min after stretch onset, and most cells eventually aligned perpendicularly to the stretch axis within 1 h. This remodeling was dependent on the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) via a Ca(2+)-permeable stretch-activated (SA) channel. During the process of remodeling, extensive rearrangement of stress fibers and focal adhesions was observed, which may be close to the final step in the intracellular signaling cascade. This event was [Ca2+]i-dependent, suggesting the existence of a Ca(2+)-dependent intermediate cascade that links [Ca2+]i to the rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal adhesions. We found that some proteins, including pp125FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and paxillin, were tyrosine phosphorylated during cyclic stretch in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.  Inhibition of this tyrosine phosphorylation prohibited the stretch-dependent rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal adhesions as well as the remodeling. Finally the tyrosine kinase src, which could phosphorylate pp125FAK, was found to be activated in a [Ca2+]i-dependent way during stretch. All of the above molecular events were consistently Ca(2+)-dependent, which led us to propose the signaling cascade: SA channel activation-->[Ca2+]i increase-->src activation-->protein tyrosine phosphorylation-->rearrangement of cytoskeletons and focal adhesions-->cell remodeling.

TI  - Participation of intraluteal progesterone and prostaglandin F2 alpha in LH-induced luteolysis in pregnant rat.  
AB  - We examined the participation of the intraluteal levels of progesterone (P4) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in the induction of luteolysis by LH and its relationship with the induction of the 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (20 alpha-HSD). Subcutaneous administration of four doses of 10 microgram ovine LH (oLH) at 0800, 0900, 1000 and 1100 h on day 19 of pregnancy induced a decrease in the activity of the enzyme 3 beta-HSD 24 and 48 h after treatment and an increase in luteal 20 alpha-HSD activity 48 h after oLH treatment when compared with control rats. Intraluteal and serum P4 levels were lower than control values 24 and 48 h after oLH treatment, with a significant increase in luteal PGF2 alpha content and a decrease in corpus luteum (CL) weight 48 h after oLH treatment. Intrabursal ovarian (i.b.) treatment with an inhibitor of PG's biosynthesis (diclofenac) (70 microgram/ovary) or P4 (3 microgram/ovary) on day 20 of pregnancy, prevented the increase in 20 alpha-HSD activity observed 48 h after oLH treatment, without any effect on 3 beta-HSD activity. The i.b. administration of P4 prevented the increase in intraluteal PGF2 alpha content induced by oLH treatment and the increases in 20 alpha-HSD activity and intraluteal PGF2 alpha content observed in control animals on day 21 of pregnancy.  The inhibition of PG biosynthesis also prevents the decrease in intraluteal and serum P4 level induced by oLH. These results provide good evidence of the important participation of intraluteal P4 and PGF2 alpha on the oLH-induced luteolysis in pregnant rats. We also found the P4 produced by the CL is involved, in part, in the regulation of luteal PG synthesis. Thus, the early decline in 3 beta-HSD activity and the consequent fall in intraluteal P4 content, may trigger the synthesis of PGs and thereafter the increase in luteal 20 alpha-HSD activity to establish luteolysis.

TI  - Allergens in pepper and paprika. Immunologic investigation of the celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome.  
AB  - Mugwort and birch pollen allergy are frequently associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to celery and spices. We analyzed 22 sera from patients with the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome for IgE binding to the spices pepper and paprika by immunoblotting. Immunoblot results revealed two major allergens of 28 and 60 kDa in pepper and a 23-kDa allergen together with allergens of higher molecular weight in paprika. In immunoblot-inhibition studies, crude mugwort, birch pollen, and celery extracts significantly reduced the IgE binding to pepper and paprika allergens. However, no inhibition was achieved with rBet v 1 and rBet v 2, suggesting that no homologs of these birch proteins act as allergens in pepper or paprika extracts. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 14- and 28-kDa pepper and 23-kDa paprika allergens revealed no homology to known allergens. The 28-kDa pepper allergen showed homology to a wheat germin protein, and the 23-kDa paprika allergen was identified as a homolog of a osmotin-like or pathogenesis-related protein in tomato. Therefore, we conclude that the IgE cross-reactivity in the mugwort-birch-celery-spice syndrome to the spices pepper and paprika is not caused by homologs of Bet v 1 and profilin. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the main allergens in pepper and paprika indicate a relation to frequently occurring plant proteins.

TI  - The effect of ATP-depletion on the inhibition of glucose exits from human red cells.  
AB  - The effect of ATP-depletion or its consequence, by metabolic inhibition, on the inhibition of glucose transport by various inhibitors was studied in human red cells. In cells depleted of ATP, glucose exit times were longer than in normal cells and the times increased with the duration of depletion. The Km for external glucose was higher in ATP-depleted cells than in normal undepleted cells (3.0 mM c.f. 2.5 mM at 30 degrees C). In contrast, the apparent Ki for cytochalasin B decreased from 0.85 microM in the normal cells to 0.5 microM after ATP-depletion. Half-maximal rates of glucose exit in the absence, and in the presence of 2 microM cytochalasin B were found at ATP concentrations of 0.43 and 0.68 microM, respectively. Although glucose exits from ATP-depleted cells exposed to the irreversible inhibitor of glucose transport, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) were slower than in normal cells, the relative degrees of inhibition were not significantly different. However, normal and ATP-depleted cells responded differently to treatment with 1,2-cyclohexanedione, a modifier of arginine residues which inhibits glucose exit. While normal cells were markedly inhibited, depleted cells were much less affected and the inhibitory effect of cytochalasin B seen in normal cells was reduced. These findings demonstrate that the glucose transport system of human red cells is affected by intracellular ATP and that ATP alters the affinity of the transporter for certain inhibitors. The implications of these findings are discussed. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - The overexpression of Bax produces cell death upon induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition.  
AB  - Stably transfected Jurkat T cells were produced in which Bax expression is inducible by muristerone A. The cell death resulting from induction of the overexpression of Bax was prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) with cyclosporin A (CyA) in combination with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid (ArA). The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-Asp-Glu-Val aspartic acid fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD-FMK) had no effect on the loss of viability. The MPT was measured as the CyA plus ArA-preventable loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). The MPT was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase-3 activation in the cytosol, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), and DNA fragmentation, all of which were inhibited by CyA plus ArA. Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on the loss of DeltaPsim and the redistribution of cytochrome c but did prevent caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. It is concluded that Bax induces the MPT, a critical event in the loss of cell viability. In addition to the cell death, the MPT mediates other typical manifestations of apoptosis in this model, namely release of cytochrome c, caspase activation with PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation.

TI  -  Inhibition of methotrexate-induced chromosomal damage by folinic acid in V79 cells.  
AB  - Methotrexate (MTX), an anticancer compound, is widely used in the treatment of leukemia. It induces cytogenetic damage as well as cytostatic effects on a variety of cell systems. Folinic acid (Leucovorin) is generally administered along with MTX as a rescue agent to decrease MTX-induced toxicity. However, information regarding the inhibitory effect of folinic acid against cytogenetic damage caused by MTX is limited. This study was conducted to assess the cytogenetic effect of MTX and its inhibition by folinic acid (FA) using the micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays concurrently. Exponentially growing V79 cells were treated with MTX at five different concentrations (5-100 micrograms ml-1) with S9 microsomal fraction for 6 h and post-treated with two concentrations of FA (5 or 50 micrograms) for 40 h. Results indicate that MTX alone induced a concentration-related increase in % micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) and % aberrant cells (Abs). There was a decrease in nuclear division index (NDI) with increase in MTX concentration. Similarly, the mitotic index (MI) also decreased in all concentrations of MTX tested. The addition of FA at 50 micrograms ml-1 significantly reduced % MNBN (40-68%) and % Abs (36-77%). Inhibition was also seen at 5 micrograms FA (12 to 54% for MNBN and 20 to 61% for Abs). These results indicate that FA is capable of reducing the cytogenetic damage induced by MTX and appears to be an anticlastogenic agent.

TI  -  Inhibition of hepatitis C virus adsorption to peripheral blood mononuclear cells by dextran sulfate.  
AB  - Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can be infected in vitro with sera of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. We have treated pools of PBMC with dextran sulfate MW 8,000, before infection with various HCV(+) sera. When the cells were treated with dextran sulfate 10-3 M, HCV RNA was no longer detectable after infection with all HCV genotypes tested. When the cells incubated with dextran sulfate 10-3 M and 10-4 M were maintained in culture for 4 weeks, no significant HCV replication could be observed. Our data suggest that dextran sulfate inhibits the attachment of HCV to the cell surface, since the HCV RNA detection was similar to control cells when dextran sulfate was added after infection.

TI  - Impaired learning in rats in a 14-unit T-maze by 7-nitroindazole, a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, is attenuated by the nitric oxide donor, molsidomine.  
AB  - In previous experiments, it was demonstrated that systemic or central administration of the nitric oxide synthase (NO synthase) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (N-Arg), produced dose-dependent learning impairments in rats in a 14-unit T-maze; and that sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, could attenuate the impairment. Since N-Arg is not specific for neuronal NO synthase and produces hypertension, it is possible that effects on the cardiovasculature may have contributed to the impaired maze performance. In the present experiment, we have investigated the maze performance of 3-4 months old male Fischer-344 rats following treatment with 7-nitroindazole, a NO synthase inhibitor that is selective for neuronal NO synthase and does not produce hypertension. In addition, we examined the effects of the NO donor, molsidomine, which is much longer acting than sodium nitroprusside. Rats were pretrained to avoid footshock in a straight runway and received training in a 14-unit T-maze 24 h later. In an initial dose-response study, rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of either 7-nitroindazole (25, 50, or 65 mg/kg) or peanut oil 30 min prior to maze training. 7-nitroindazole produced significant, dose-dependent maze acquisition deficits, with 65 mg/kg producing the greatest learning impairment. This dose of 7-nitroindazole had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure. Following the dose-response study, rats were given i.p. injections of either 7-nitroindazole (70 mg/kg) plus saline, 7-nitroindazole (70 mg/kg) plus the NO donor, molsidomine (2 or 4 mg/kg), or peanut oil plus saline as controls. Both doses of molsidomine significantly attenuated the learning deficit induced by 7-nitroindazole relative to controls. These findings represent the first evidence that impaired learning produced by inhibition of neuronal NO synthase can be overcome by systemic administration of a NO donor.

TI  - Changes in force and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration after length changes in isolated rat ventricular trabeculae.  
AB  - 1. Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) were measured in isolated rat trabeculae that had been micro-injected with fura-2 salt, in order to investigate the mechanism by which twitch force changes following an alteration of muscle length. 2. A step increase in length of the muscle produced a rapid potentiation of twitch force but not of the Ca2+ transient. The rapid rise of force was unaffected by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid. 3. The force-[Ca2+]i relationship of the myofibrils in situ, determined from twitches and tetanic contractions in SR-inhibited muscles, showed that the rapid rise of force was due primarily to an increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, with a contribution from an increase in the maximum force production of the myofibrils. 4. After stretch of the muscle there was a further, slow increase of twitch force which was due entirely to a slow increase of the Ca2+ transient, since there was no change in the myofibrillar force-[Ca2+]i relationship.  SR inhibition slowed down, but did not alter the magnitude of, the slow force response. 5. During the slow rise of force there was no slow increase of diastolic [Ca2+]i, whether or not the SR was inhibited. The same was true in unstimulated muscles. 6. We conclude that the rapid increase in twitch force after muscle stretch is due to the length-dependent properties of the myofibrils. The slow force increase is not explained by length dependence of the myofibrils or the SR, or by a rise in diastolic [Ca2+]i. Evidence from tetani suggests the slow force responses result from increased Ca2+ loading of the cell during the action potential.

TI  - Beneficial effects of intermittent fluid pressure of low physiological magnitude on cartilage and inflammation in osteoarthritis. An in vitro study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro effects of low physiological levels of intermittent fluid pressure (0-13 kPa; 0.33 Hz), in the absence of mechanical stress, on articular cartilage, inflammatory cells, and on the combination of these components, present in the osteoarthritic (OA) joint. METHODS: Normal and OA cartilage was obtained at autopsy. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis (OA-SF) or peripheral blood from healthy donors (PB). Cartilage and MNC were cultured alone and in co-culture; cultures were carried out with and without exposure to intermittent fluid pressure. Levels of intermittent fluid pressure varied from 0 to 13 kPa (0.33 Hz), comparable with levels present during joint distraction in treatment of OA. Changes in cartilage proteoglycan metabolism and MNC cytokine production were analyzed. RESULTS: Cartilage matrix synthesis was stimulated by intermittent fluid pressure in OA cartilage, while normal cartilage was not affected. No effects on proteoglycan release were detected.  Inhibition of cartilage proteoglycan synthesis, induced by OA synovial fluid MNC (OA-SF-MNC) in co-culture, was reduced when cultures had been exposed to intermittent fluid pressure. Analysis of conditioned media of OA-SF-MNC revealed that the beneficial effect of intermittent fluid pressure was accompanied by a decrease in production of the catabolic cytokines interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Similar effects were observed for MNC isolated from PB. CONCLUSION: Low levels of intermittent fluid pressure, as occur in vivo during joint distraction, have beneficial effects on joint tissue in OA, indicating that this factor could be useful in treatment of OA.

Studies utilizing the overexpression of individual isoforms indicated that both PKC-alpha and -delta promote a number of biological effects, including inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton in the murine B-cell lymphoma (Baf3), differentiation of the murine promyelocyte line 32D, and activation of MAP kinase in CHO fibroblasts.

TI  - Cross-talk between protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) and -delta (PKC-delta): PKC-alpha elevates the PKC-delta protein level, altering its mRNA transcription and degradation.  
AB  - Studies utilizing the overexpression of individual isoforms indicated that both PKC-alpha and -delta promote a number of biological effects, including inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton in the murine B-cell lymphoma (Baf3), differentiation of the murine promyelocyte line 32D, and activation of MAP kinase in CHO fibroblasts. We postulated that these results reflect some form of cross-regulation between PKC-alpha and -delta rather than their functional redundancy. In this report, we show that overexpression of PKC-alpha in Baf3 and 32D leads to an elevation of the endogenous PKC-delta mRNA and protein levels. The elevated steady-state PKC-delta mRNA level results from a combination of increased PKC-delta transcription and mRNA stability. Upregulation of PKC-delta mRNA by PKC-alpha occurs even after a selective depletion of the PKC-delta protein. In addition, phorbol ester-induced elevation of PKC-delta mRNA and protein levels can be prevented by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, an indication of the requirement for PKC kinase activity. Inhibition of new protein synthesis by cycloheximide showed that upregulation of PKC-delta mRNA, as opposed to delayed downregulation of the PKC-delta protein, is primarily responsible for the accumulation of this isoform by PKC-alpha. In parental Baf3 and 32D cells and PKC-alpha overexpressers, PKC-alpha and PKC-delta are uniquely involved in cross-regulation, while PKC-epsilon, PKC-eta, and PKC-mu are not.

TI  - Ethanol inhibition of NMDA currents in acutely dissociated medial septum/diagonal band neurons from ethanol dependent rats.  
AB  - The effect of acutely applied ethanol and the impact of chronic ethanol treatment, sufficient to induce tolerance and physical dependence, on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function were studied in acutely isolated neurons from the medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DB) of adult rats using whole cell, patch-clamp electrophysiology. There was a small positive correlation for capacitance and current amplitude activated by 100 microM NMDA for all groups. Also, cell membrane capacitance was significantly smaller for Ethanol Dependent (approximately 80-84%) than either Naive or Control cells. Therefore NMDA-activated responses were normalized for capacitance (current density, pA/pF) across all three groups. NMDA-activated (30-1000 microM) responses were significantly larger in cells from Control and Ethanol Dependent rats relative to those from Naives. In addition, estimated maximal responses were significantly larger for Ethanol Dependent cells, compared to either Control or Naive, respectively, while EC50s and slopes were not significantly different. Acute 60 mM ethanol significantly inhibited responses to 100 microM NMDA in all three groups, however, mean ethanol inhibition was 12-25% smaller after ethanol dependence. There was no evidence of acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition for any group, but examination of patterns of inhibition for individual neurons showed a few cells were resistant to ethanol or exhibited progressive loss of ethanol inhibition. These results suggest that NMDA receptor function in acutely isolated MS/DB neurons is increased following in vivo chronic ethanol treatment, and shows resistance to acute ethanol inhibition suggesting NMDA receptor-mediated cellular tolerance.

TI  - Antiproliferative effects of inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition on decidualization in pseudopregnant rats.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the involvement in decidual proliferation of nitric oxide (NO), a regulator of many cellular processes, that is synthesized from L-arginine by NO synthase. The investigation was conducted on pseudopregnant (PG) rats in which the decidual cell reaction, the basis for the decidualization process, was surgically induced by uterine trauma on PG Day 4. Groups of animals (n = 5) were pretreated with either 2 doses/day of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) that inhibits NO synthase, or twice daily doses of L-NAME plus L-arginine combined. Drug application times coincided with 3 hr after lights on or 3 hr before lights off. The two treatment regimens (PG Days 1-4 or 5-8) respectively preceded or followed decidual induction. Animals were sacrificed at mid-light on PG Day 9, the day of maximal growth response to the deciduogenic stimulus. Parallel, time-dependent increases in both NO synthase activity and decidual growth occurred mainly in the endometrium. L-NAME produced reductions in endometrial and myometrial growth that were reversed by the combined L-NAME plus L-arginine treatments. These inhibitory effects by L-NAME were caused by only the pretraumal (PG Days 1-4) administration. Hormonally, circulating progesterone levels were similarly affected by this early treatment and may also contribute to the reduced decidual sensitivity. In contrast, serum estradiol, along with the zinc metalloenzymes, alkaline phosphatase and the matrix metalloproteinases--prominent decidualization biomarkers--were all unaffected by either the pre- or post-decidual induction dosings. The study demonstrates that inducible NO synthase/endogenous NO may physiologically participate in uterine metabolism during the decidual cell reaction. Moreover, by virtue of L-NAME inhibition of the decidual response, it appears that NO synthase/NO may influence decidual growth either by directly increasing uterine sensitivity to the deciduogenic stimulus or by indirectly affecting endometrial vascularity and subsequent availability of decidual metabolites.

TI  - Reactivities of the S2 and S3 subsite residues of thrombin with the native and heparin-induced conformers of antithrombin.  
AB  - A pentasaccharide (PS) fragment of heparin capable of activating antithrombin (AT) markedly accelerates the inhibition of factor Xa by AT, but has insignificant effect on inhibition of thrombin. For inhibition of thrombin, the bridging function of a longer polysaccharide chain is required to accelerate the reaction. To study the basis for the similar reactivity of thrombin with the native or heparin-activated conformers of AT, several residues surrounding the active site pocket of thrombin were targeted for mutagenesis study. Leu99 and Glu192, the variant residues influencing the S2 and S3 subsite specificity of thrombin were replaced with Tyr and Gln. The Tyr60a, Pro60b, Pro60c, and Trp60d residues forming part of the S2 specificity pocket were deleted from the B-insertion loop of the wild-type and Leu99/Glu192 --> Tyr/Gln thrombins. Kinetic studies indicated that the reactivities of all mutants with AT were moderately or severely impaired. Although heparin largely corrected the defect in reactivities, it also markedly elevated the stoichiometries of inhibition with the mutants. Interestingly, PS also accelerated AT inhibition of the mutants 5-68-fold, suggesting that the mutants are able to discriminate between the native and activated conformers of AT. Based on these results and the recent crystal structure determination of AT in complex with PS, a model for thrombin-AT interaction is proposed in which the S2 and S3 subsite residues of thrombin are critical for recognition of the P2 and P3 residues of AT in the native conformation. In the activated conformation, other residues are made accessible for interaction with the protease, and the similar reactivity of thrombin with the native and heparin-activated conformers of AT may be coincidental. The results further suggest that the S2 and S3 subsite residues are crucial in controlling the partitioning of the thrombin-AT intermediate into the alternative inhibitory or substrate pathways of the reaction.

TI  - Suppression of phospholipase C blocks Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity.  
AB  - The potential effect of inhibition of phospholipase C on the response of Gi-coupled receptors was investigated in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid (NG108-15) cells. The phospholipase C specific inhibitor 1-[6-((17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl]-1H -pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122), which did not affect basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities, time- and dose-dependently blocked delta-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, the EC50 (0.5 microM) of which was consistent with that for inhibition of bradykinin-dependent phospholipase C activation (EC50 = 1 microM). U73122 treatment also blocked functional responses of m4 muscarinic receptor and alpha2-adrenoceptor in NG108-15 cells and three opioid receptors (mu, delta and opioid receptor-like receptor (ORL1)) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. 1-[6-((17Beta-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl]-2, 5-pyrrolidinedione (U73343), an inactive analog of U73122, did not show any effect, which suggests that the blockade by U73122 of Gi-coupled receptor-mediated signaling is probably mediated through inhibition of phospholipase C, although a possible direct modification of G proteins can not be excluded. Furthermore, treatment with U73122 but not U73343 blocked the GTP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, indicating blockade at the level of Gi proteins.

TI  - Integrin and cadherin synergy regulates contact inhibition of migration and motile activity.  
AB  - Integrin receptors play a central role in cell migration through their roles as adhesive receptors for both other cells and extracellular matrix components. In this study, we demonstrate that integrin and cadherin receptors coordinately regulate contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. In addition to promoting proliferation (Sastry, S., M. Lakonishok, D. Thomas, J. Muschler, and A. Horwitz. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 133:169-184), ectopic expression of the alpha5 integrin in cultures of primary quail myoblasts promotes a striking contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Myoblasts ectopically expressing alpha5 integrin (alpha5 myoblasts) move normally when not in contact, but upon contact, they show inhibition of migration and motile activity (i.e., extension and retraction of membrane protrusions). As a consequence, these cells tend to grow in aggregates and do not migrate to close a wound. This phenotype is also seen with ectopic expression of beta1 integrin, paxillin, or activated FAK (CD2 FAK) and therefore appears to result from enhanced integrin-mediated signaling. The contact inhibition observed in the alpha5 myoblasts is mediated by N-cadherin, whose expression is upregulated more than fivefold. Perturbation studies using low calcium conditions, antibody inhibition, and ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant N-cadherins all implicate N-cadherin in the contact inhibition of migration. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin also produces cells that show inhibited migration upon contact; however, they do not show suppressed motile activity, suggesting that integrins and cadherins coordinately regulate motile activity. These observations have potential importance to normal and pathologic processes during embryonic development and tumor metastasis.

TI  - Modulation of ICAM-1 expression by alpha-MSH in human melanoma cells and melanocytes.  
AB  - Alpha-MSH, a proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide, is known to be produced in the pituitary, the skin, and melanoma tumors and to possess many biological effects, mainly on melanocyte pigmentation and growth. Moreover, the melanocyte expresses adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1. The latter has been reported to play a role in melanoma spread and associated metastatic process. We conducted a study in order to evaluate the possible effect of MSH on ICAM-1 expression in human cultured malignant and normal melanocytes. Our data show that alpha-MSH inhibits ICAM-1 expression stimulated by TNF in a concentration-dependent manner, both at the protein and gene expression level. Ninety percent inhibition was obtained with 10 nM MSH, while 50% inhibition was achieved with 1 nM. Endogenous cAMP elevation with forskolin as well as an exogenous cAMP stable analogue (Sp-cAMPS) produced the same inhibitory effect. A screening of malignant melanocytes showed that inhibition of ICAM-1 expression could be achieved only in those cells expressing detectable MSH receptors and seemed to correlate with the number of binding sites. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest alpha-MSH as a potent inhibitor of ICAM-1 expression in malignant melanocytes acting through MSH receptor stimulation and subsequent cAMP increase.

TI  - Independence of dimethylamiloride-sensitive Li+ efflux pathways and Na+-Li+ countertransport in human erythrocytes.  
AB  - The in vivo function of the erythrocyte Na+-Li+ countertransport (SLC) is unknown. Whether SLC may reflect an operational mode of the widespread Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) or may otherwise be expression of an independent membrane transport, remains presently unclear. We explored the presence of 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA)-sensitive Li+ pathways in human erythrocytes where the activity of the Na+ pump, Na+-K+ cotransport and anion exchange were suitably inhibited. A total of 0.02 mM DMA had no effect on SLC as expected, but gave a significant inhibition of Li+ efflux into both Na+ and Na+-free media. This DMA-sensitive Li+ pathway, but not SLC, was significantly enhanced by hyperosmolar cell shrinkage, which is a characteristic feature of NHE. In conclusion, DMA-sensitive Li+ pathways, possibly mediated by NHE, are present in erythrocytes and coexist with the DMA-insensitive, SLC. This finding supports the notion that SLC is independent of amiloride-sensitive NHE. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Effects of pharmacological inhibition of glutamate-uptake on ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux and anoxic depolarization latency.  
AB  - It has been proposed that deficient glutamate uptake, by increasing the extracellular concentration of this excitatory neurotransmitter, may contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral ischaemia. This study aimed to examine whether pharmacological inhibition of glutamate uptake altered the kinetics of ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux, and precipitated anoxic depolarisation. Microdialysis was used for application of the glutamate-uptake inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (L-trans-PDC), recording of the EEG and extracellular direct current (DC) potential with an electrode within the probe, and continuous monitoring of changes in extracellular glutamate. L-trans-PDC was applied locally from 8 min prior to cardiac arrest to the end of the recording period. L-trans-PDC (2.5 mM) barely altered the time course of postmortem glutamate efflux in the cortex. Only the maximum rate of efflux during the first exocytotic phase, and the concentration reached at the end of this phase, appeared slightly increased. L-trans-PDC (5 mM) reduced significantly the delay between EEG silence and anoxic depolarization in the cerebral cortex (59.2 +/- 9.2 s vs. 79.7 +/- 11.5 s; n = 6), but not in the striatum and hippocampus. These effects contrast with the marked increase in dialysate glutamate that L-trans-PDC produces in all these three brain regions. Together, these data do not support the hypothesis that inhibition of glutamate uptake plays a critical role, early in cerebral ischaemia. However, a contribution of reversed glutamate uptake to the secondary Ca2+-independent phase of ischaemia-induced glutamate efflux cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Effects of a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor on renal sodium handling and diluting capacity in humans.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects. Limited information is available on the role of NO in tubular sodium transport in the human kidney. METHODS: We studied nine healthy, sodium-replete males with clearance techniques during maximal diuresis. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 3 mg/kg priming dose plus 3 mg/kg/h) was infused for 3 h, to achieve steady-state inhibition of NO synthesis. Data were compared with a time control study. RESULTS: The effects of L-NMMA were quickly established and persisted through the entire infusion period. Mean arterial pressure increased slightly from 85+/-3 to 91+/-3 mmHg (P<0.05). Renal plasma flow decreased substantially, and glomerular filtration rate slightly. Large decreases in absolute sodium excretion, from 79+/-10 to 34+/-5 micromol/min (P<0.01), and fractional sodium excretion, from 0.5+/-0.0 to 0.3+/-0.0% (P<0.01), were associated with significant reductions in fractional lithium excretion (P<0.05) and maximum urine flow (P<0.01). Minimal urine sodium concentration decreased from 5.8+/-0.04 to 3.9+/-0.4 mmol/l (P<0.01) whereas minimal urine osmolality increased (P<0.05). Plasma renin activity, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide levels did not change, whereas urinary excretions of guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate and of nitrite plus nitrate decreased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis in humans to an extent that raises blood pressure only mildly causes antinatriuresis, that can be attributed to increases in sodium reabsorption both at proximal and distal nephron sites. In addition, renal diluting capacity decreases. The effects in the diluting segment have not been reported before, and may be due to medullary vasoconstriction, similar to that described for angiotensin II.

TI  - Liver metastasis and adhesion to the sinusoidal endothelium by human colon cancer cells is related to mucin carbohydrate chain length.  
AB  - Mucin production by human colon cancer cells correlates with liver metastasis in animal models, but it is not known which steps in metastasis depend on specific alterations in mucin synthesis. Clonal variants of cell line LS174T selected for differences in mucin core carbohydrate expression have been further characterized biochemically, and tested for their ability to participate in metastasis-related events. LS-C mucin contains truncated carbohydrates enriched for sialyl Tn and these cells bind to basement membrane matrix to a greater extent than LS-B cells. This binding is partially inhibitable by antibody to sialyl Tn. LS-B produces more fully glycosylated mucin and preferentially binds to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and E-selectin through sialylated peripheral mucin-associated carbohydrate structures. Adhesion of LS-B to endothelial cells is inhibited by neutralizing antibody to E-selectin, and inhibition of glycosylation or desialylation of LS-B mucin abrogates binding to E-selectin in vitro. LS-B cells spontaneously metastasized from cecum to liver and colonized the liver of athymic mice after splenic-portal injection to a significantly greater extent than LS-C, suggesting that expression of peripheral mucin carbohydrate structures is most important for metastasis of human colon cancer cells.

TI  - Morphine administered in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis inhibits nociceptive activities in the spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis.  
AB  - The present study investigates the effects of morphine microinjection into the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) or the spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis (Sp5O) on C-fiber-evoked activities of Sp5O convergent neurons, after supramaximal percutaneous electrical stimulation in halothane-anesthetized rats. When it was microinjected into the Sp5O, morphine (2.5 microg in 0. 25 microl) never depressed the C-fiber-evoked responses of Sp5O convergent neurons (n = 13), whereas these neurons were responsive to the inhibitory effects of systemic morphine (6 mg/kg, i.v.) in a naloxone-reversible manner. On the contrary, morphine microinjected into the Sp5C produced a naloxone-reversible inhibition of the C-fiber-evoked responses of Sp5O neurons (n = 14). The magnitude and the time course of this effect varied according to the location of the injection sites. After microinjection into the superficial laminae (n = 7), a strong depressive effect of morphine (7 +/- 5% of control) on the C-fiber-evoked responses was apparent as soon as 5 min after the injection and could always be reversed by naloxone, administered either intravenously (0.4 mg/kg) or locally (2.5 microg in 0.6 microl) at the same site as morphine. After microinjection into deeper laminae (V-VI), a significant depressive effect (34 +/- 5% of control) of morphine could be detected only 20 min after the injection and was reversed only by intravenous administration of naloxone. These results suggest that morphine exerts its antinociceptive action on Sp5O convergent neurons by blocking the C-fiber inputs that relay in the Sp5C substantia gelatinosa. The mechanisms that underlie the activation of Sp5O convergent neurons by C-fibers and the inhibition of C-fiber-evoked responses of Sp5O convergent neurons by morphine microinjected into the Sp5C are discussed.

TI  - Metabolism of the anticancer drug flavopiridol, a new inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases, in rat liver.  
AB  - Flavopiridol (FLAP) is a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical phase I trials. To examine hepatic metabolism and biliary disposition of FLAP we applied the isolated perfused rat liver system. Besides FLAP two metabolites were detected by high performance liquid chromatography in bile and perfusate. Twenty-five min after FLAP (30 microM) addition to the perfusion medium, biliary secretion of metabolite 1 and 2 reached a maximum of 1.04 +/- 0.52 and 11.34 +/- 4.72 nmol/g.liver.min, respectively. Biliary excretion of parent FLAP, however, continuously increased for 60 min up to 406 +/- 134 pmol/g liver.min. In the perfusate, metabolite 1 was below detection limit and release of metabolite 2 was low (2.8 +/- 0.7 pmol/g liver.min after 60 min). Enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, mass spectroscopy and electron absorption spectroscopy revealed that both metabolites are monoglucuronides with the glucuronide in position 5 and 7 of the flavonoid core, respectively. The amount of FLAP, metabolite 1 and metabolite 2 excreted into bile during the 60 min of perfusion was 1.94 +/- 0.91, 5.15 +/- 1.95 and 57.29 +/- 23.60% of FLAP cleared from the perfusate during 60 min, respectively. In contrast to the structurally similar flavonoids genistein and daidzein, no inhibition of UDP-glucuronyltransferase with methylumbelliferone as a substrate was observed indicating that different UDP-glucuronyltransferase isoforms are involved in FLAP metabolism. In conclusion, we find that glucuronidation is the major mechanism of hepatic FLAP biotransformation. Metabolites are mainly excreted into bile but also released into systemic circulation. The pharmacological and toxicological effects of these metabolites remain to be elucidated.

TI  - A role for the signal transduction protein PII in the control of nitrate/nitrite uptake in a cyanobacterium.  
AB  - In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, ammonium exerts a rapid and reversible inhibition of the nitrate and nitrite uptake, and the PII protein (GlnB) is differentially phosphorylated depending on the intracellular N/C balance. RNA/DNA hybridizations, as well as nitrate and nitrite uptake experiments, were carried out with the wild-type strain and a PII-null mutant. The transcriptional control by ammonium of the expression of the nir-nrt ABCD-narB operon remained operative in the mutant but, in contrast to the wild-type strain, the mutant took up nitrate and nitrite even in the presence of ammonium. Moreover, the wild-type phenotype was restored by insertion of a copy of the wild-type glnB gene in the genome of the PII-null mutant. These results indicate that the unphosphorylated form of PII is involved in the short-term inhibition by ammonium of the nitrate and nitrite uptake in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942.

TI  - Synergistic action of quercetin and genistein in human ovarian carcinoma cells.  
AB  - Ovarian carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women and there has been a steady increase in the age-adjusted cancer death rates in the past 25 years in the US. However, patients who become cisplatin resistant respond poorly to available cytotoxic agents; therefore, discovering novel targets for ovarian carcinoma is vital. Quercetin, an anticancer agent, arrests the cell cycle at G1 and S phase boundary. Genistein, a plant flavonoid, attacks the cell cycle at G2 and/or early M phases in most carcinoma cells. Quercetin and genistein block the phosphatidylinositol conversion to IP3 signal transduction pathway mainly by inhibiting 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI kinase, EC 2.7.1.67) and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP kinase, EC 2.7.1.68), respectively. Because each drug attacks a different phase of the cell cycle and reduces IP3 concentration by attacking different signal transduction enzymes, we tested the hypothesis that the two drugs might be synergistic in human carcinoma cells. In human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-5 cells in growth inhibition assay, the IC50S for quercetin and genistein were (mean +/- SE) 66 +/- 3.0 and 32 +/- 2.5 microM; in clonogenic assays they were 15 +/- 1.2 and 5 +/- 0.5 microM, respectively. When quercetin was added to the cultures of OVCAR-5 cells followed 8 h later by genistein, synergism was observed in growth inhibition and clonogenic assays. The synergistic action of quercetin and genistein may be of interest in clinical treatment of human ovarian carcinoma.

TI  - IAPs block apoptotic events induced by caspase-8 and cytochrome c by direct inhibition of distinct caspases.  
AB  - Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene products play an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating programmed cell death in diverse species ranging from insects to humans. Human XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are direct inhibitors of at least two members of the caspase family of cell death proteases: caspase-3 and caspase-7. Here we compared the mechanism by which IAPs interfere with activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases in cytosolic extracts where caspase activation was initiated by caspase-8, a proximal protease activated by ligation of TNF-family receptors, or by cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 can prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases -3, -6 and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of pro-caspase-9. In contrast, these IAP family proteins did not prevent caspase-8-induced proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3; however, they subsequently inhibited active caspase-3 directly, thus blocking downstream apoptotic events such as further activation of caspases. These findings demonstrate that IAPs can suppress different apoptotic pathways by inhibiting distinct caspases and identify pro-caspase-9 as a new target for IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.

TI  - Oxatomide inhibits synthesis and release of platelet-activating factor in human neutrophils.  
AB  - Effect of oxatomide on release and production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in neutrophils obtained from asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients was investigated. Neutrophils were preincubated with or without oxatomide and stimulated with N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (f-MLP, 10 microM) for 15 min. PAF activity was detected by aggregation of washed guinea pig platelets. PAF activity released from asthmatic neutrophils without preincubation of oxatomide was 7.97[0.22] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells) in supernatants and 33.4[0.26] in cell pellets. After preincubation with 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M of oxatomide, PAF activity reduced to 6.77[0.37] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells), 3.99[0.25], and 0.96[0.05] (n = 15) in the supernatants, and 22.4[0.31], 16.7[0.22], and 6.35[0.11] (n = 15) in the cell pellets, respectively. PAF activity in non-asthmatic neutrophils without preincubation of oxatomide was 6.35[0.12] (mean[SEM], ng/10(7) cells) in supernatants and 27.9[0.25] in cell pellets. After preincubation with 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M of oxatomide, PAF activity reduced to 5.02[0.16] (mean [SEM], ng/10(7) cells), 3.96[0.11], and 0.94[0.03] (n = 10) in the supernatants, and 28.4[0.69], 13.78[0.17], and 2.88[0.27] (n = 10) in the cell pellets, respectively. Our results showed that preincubation with oxatomide caused a dose-dependent inhibition of intra- and extracellular PAF activity from asthmatic and non-asthmatic neutrophils in the same manner.

TI  - Control of pulsatile LH secretion during seasonal anoestrus in the ewe.  
AB  - The seasonality of reproductive activity in the ewe in temperate latitudes is controlled by photoperiod. Its annual variations control the temporal organization of the sexual cycle by changing the activity of the gonadotrophic axis. Cyclic oestrous behaviour usually appears in the ewe at the end of summer or the beginning of autumn and finishes in winter or at the very beginning of spring. Seasonal anoestrus is characterized by the absence of ovulation and sexual behaviour. During seasonal anoestrus, a decrease in LH pulse frequency is observed. The inhibition of pulsatile LH secretion is maintained throughout the anoestrous season and is responsible for the low reproductive activity during this period. Variation in the seasonal inhibition of LH pulsatility results from an increase in the negative feedback by oestradiol on LH pulse frequency during the long days of spring and summer. The inhibition of LH secretion involves increased action of dopamine in the hypothalamus on the chain of nervous elements which controls gonadotrophic activity. Among the various dopaminergic structures, the retrochiasmatic A15 nucleus is involved in the inhibitory control of LH pulsatility by oestradiol during the long day period. Oestradiol increases the dopaminergic tone of the A15 nucleus in ovariectomized ewes during the long day period. In this structure, the effect of oestradiol on the dopaminergic metabolism probably results from a direct, local activation. In the sheep, dopamine might also participate in the inhibition of gonadotrophin activity during other periods of reproductive life.

TI  - Tumorigenicity of sodium ascorbate in male rats.  
AB  - Sodium ascorbate, like other sodium salts such as saccharin, glutamate, and bicarbonate, produces urinary alterations when fed at high doses to rats, which results in mild superficial urothelial cytotoxicity and regeneration but not tumors in a standard 2-year bioassay. Sodium saccharin was shown to produce a low incidence of bladder tumors in rats if administered in a two-generation bioassay. In the present study, we evaluated sodium ascorbate in a two-generation bioassay that involved feeding to the male and female parental F344 rats for 4 weeks before mating, feeding the dams during gestation and lactation, and then feeding the weaned (at 28 days of age) male F1 generation rats for the remainder of their lifetime (up to 128 weeks of the experiment). Dietary levels of 1.0, 5.0, and 7.0% sodium ascorbate were tested. At 5.0 and 7.0% sodium ascorbate, there was an increase in urinary bladder urothelial papillary and nodular hyperplasia and the induction of a few papillomas and carcinomas. There was a dose-responsive increase in renal pelvic calcification and hyperplasia and inhibition of the aging nephropathy of rats even at the level of 1% sodium ascorbate. Because the short-term urothelial effects of sodium ascorbate in rats are inhibited by treatments producing urinary acidification to pH < 6.0, we coadministered high doses of long-term NH4Cl to groups of rats with 5.0 or 7.0% sodium ascorbate to evaluate the long-term effects. The combination of 7.0% sodium ascorbate plus 2.78% NH4Cl in the diet was toxic, and the group was terminated early during the course of the experiment. The group fed 5.0% sodium ascorbate plus 2.04% NH4Cl showed complete inhibition of the urothelial effects of sodium ascorbate and significant inhibition of its renal effects. We also demonstrated the presence of a calcium phosphate-containing urinary precipitate in rats fed sodium ascorbate at all doses, in a dose-responsive manner. The formation of the precipitate was inhibited by coadministration with NH4Cl. The proliferative effects of sodium ascorbate on the male rat urinary tract in this study are similar to those seen with sodium saccharin when administered in a two-generation bioassay. Mechanistic information suggests that this is a high-dose, rat-specific phenomenon.

TI  - Cortical control of presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents in humans.  
AB  - The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation was investigated on presynaptic inhibition of Ia terminals in the human upper and lower limb. Presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents was assessed by three different and independent methods: (1) heteronymous Ia facilitation of the H-reflex (assessing ongoing presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents in the conditioning volley); (2) long-lasting inhibition of the H-reflex by a group I volley (D1 inhibition, assessing presynaptic inhibition on Ia afferents in the test volley); (3) measurement of the monosynaptic Ia peak evoked in single motor units by a homonymous or heteronymous volley (post stimulus time histogram method). The first two methods were used on the lower limb; the last two on the upper limb. Provided that the corticospinal volley and the explored Ia volley were directed to the same target motoneurones, cortical stimulation evoked significant and congruent changes: (1) In the lower limb, transcranial stimulation provided increased heteronymous Ia facilitation and decreased D1 inhibition, both of which suggest a decrease in presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents; (2) in the upper limb, transcranial stimulation provided an increase in the radial-induced inhibition of the wrist flexor H-reflex and a decrease in the peak of monosynaptic Ia excitation in single units, both of which suggest an increase in presynaptic inhibition. Selectivity of corticospinal effects was explored by testing presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents to soleus motoneurones and focusing the transcranial stimulation to excite preferentially different motor nuclei (soleus, quadriceps and tibialis anterior). A cortical-induced decrease in presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents was seen when, and only when, cortical and peripheral Ia volleys were directed to the same motor nucleus.

TI  - The roles of the bacteriophage T4 r genes in lysis inhibition and fine-structure genetics: a new perspective.  
AB  - Seldom has the study of a set of genes contributed more to our understanding of molecular genetics than has the characterization of the rapid-lysis genes of bacteriophage T4. For example, T4 rII mutants were used to define gene structure and mutagen effects at the molecular level and to help unravel the genetic code. The large-plaque morphology of these mutants reflects a block in expressing lysis inhibition (LIN), the ability to delay lysis for several hours in response to sensing external related phages attacking the cell, which is a unique and highly adaptive attribute of the T4 family of phages. However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of LIN, or how the various r genes affect its expression. Here, we review the extensive old literature about the r genes and the lysis process and try to sort out the major players affecting lysis inhibition. We confirm that superinfection can induce lysis inhibition even while infected cells are lysing, suggesting that the signal response is virtually instantaneous and thus probably the result of post-translational regulation. We identify the rI gene as ORF tk.-2, based on sequence analysis of canonical rI mutants. The rI gene encodes a peptide of 97 amino acids (Mr = 11.1 kD; pI = 4.8) that probably is secreted into the periplasmic space. This gene is widely conserved among T-even phage. We then present a model for LIN, postulating that rI is largely responsible for regulating the gpt holin protein in response to superinfection. The evidence suggests that the rIIA and B genes are not directly involved in lysis inhibition; rather, when they are absent, an alternate pathway for lysis develops which depends on the presence of genes from any of several possible prophages and is not sensitive to lysis inhibition.

TI  -  Inhibition of an established allergic response to ovalbumin in BALB/c mice by killed Mycobacterium vaccae.  
AB  - Allergic disorders are mediated by T lymphocytes secreting T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), resulting in high levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and recruitment of eosinophils. One of the treatment strategies is to downregulate the Th2 component by inducing a T helper 1 (Th1) response to the relevant allergen, because Th1 and Th2 cytokines are thought to be mutually antagonistic. In this study, we examined the effects of Mycobacterium vaccae, a potent inducer of Th1 immunity, on allergic responses in a murine model. A single injection of M. vaccae into ovalbumin (OVA)-preimmunized BALB/c mice suppressed serum IgE over a wide dose range (10(7), 10(8) or 10(9) M. vaccae). Further experiments, using 10(7) M. vaccae injected twice, showed that this treatment inhibited not only serum IgE, but also the potential for ovalbumin-induced IL-5 production by spleen cells. This non-specific ability of a mycobacterium to decrease Th2 activity, even when not presented together with the allergen, is in agreement with recent epidemiological studies on the impact of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, and of other potent Th1 stimuli, on the incidence of atopy. The suppression of serum IgE and allergen-specific IL-5 synthesis by M. vaccae suggest that this organism is likely to have clinical application in the immunotherapy of allergy.

TI  - Chimeric scFv/gamma receptor-mediated T-cell lysis of tumor cells is coregulated by adhesion and accessory molecules.  
AB  - Adhesion and accessory molecules play a critical role in T-cell activation and effector function in general and in tumor cell recognition and lysis in particular. We investigated the contribution of CD2, CD3, CD11a/CD18, CD54 and CD58 molecules in T lymphocyte-tumor cell interactions mediated by chimeric immunoglobulin receptors. The chimeric receptor is composed of a single chain antibody binding site and a gamma-chain signal transducing molecule (scFv/gamma). T lymphocytes expressing such scFv/gamma receptors recognize the G250 Ag on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in an major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner and exert RCC selective cytolysis. A coregulatory role for CD2, CD3 and CD11a/CD18 molecules in scFv/gamma-mediated cytolysis was demonstrated using monoclonal antibody (MAb)-induced inhibition of scFv/gamma-mediated cytolysis. The inhibition of lysis was not due to inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-target cell conjugation but rather to a post-conjugate signaling event. Binding of CD54 and CD58 MAbs to the RCC did not inhibit cytolysis of RCC cells that expressed high levels of both CD54 and the G250 antigen (Ag) (A75), whereas cytolysis of RCC expressing intermediate levels of CD54 and G250 Ag (SK-RC-17 cl.4) was partly inhibited by the CD54 MAb. Binding of low concentrations of G250 MAb to RCC (A75) rendered these cells sensitive to CD54 MAb inhibition, demonstrating a direct functional relation between G250 Ag expression level and adhesion molecules. Taken together, our findings indicate a coregulatory role for CD2, CD3 and CD11a/CD18 molecules in the scFv/gamma-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells and show that the requirement of CD11a/CD18-CD54 interactions is dependent on the level of free Ag. This make these gene-transduced T lymphocytes attractive tools for adoptive immunogene therapy of cancer.

TI  - Functional implications of nitric oxide produced by mitochondria in mitochondrial metabolism.  
AB  - The effects of endogenous production of NO., catalysed by the mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), on mitochondrial metabolism were studied. The respiratory rates of intact mitochondria in State 4 were decreased by 40% and 28% with succinate and malate-glutamate, respectively, in the presence of L-arginine (L-Arg); conversely, the O2 uptake with NG-methyl-L-arginine (NMMA), a competitive inhibitor of NOS, was increased. The production of NO. and the inhibition of the respiratory rates were dependent on the metabolic state in which mitochondria were maintained: NO. production was probably supported by mitochondrial NADPH, the latter maintained by the energy-dependent transhydrogenase. In addition to the decline in the respiratory rate, an inhibition of ATP synthesis was also observed (40-50%) following supplementation with L-Arg. The dependence of the respiratory rates of mitochondria in State 3 and cytochrome oxidase activities on O2 concentrations with either L-Arg or NMMA indicated that both processes were competitively inhibited by NO. at the cytochrome oxidase level. This inhibition can be explained by the interaction of NO. with cytochrome oxidase at the binuclear centre. The role of NO. as a physiological modulator of cytochrome oxidase is discussed in terms of cellular metabolism.

TI  - A c-myc antisense oligonucleotide inhibits human retinal pigment epithelial cell proliferation.  
AB  - The purpose of this work was to investigate if MYC-dependent intracellular mitogenic pathway is active in cultures of human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells and whether myc antisense phosphorotioate oligonucleotides (c-myc-AS-ODN) are useful tools for inhibiting the proliferation of hRPE cells. Cultures of hRPE cells were established from adult human corneal donors. These cells were positively stained for cytokeratins and vimentin. Myc mRNA expression was determined by Northern blot analysis and it was determined by means of immunofluorescence if MYC was expressed. C-myc-AS-ODN effect on cell proliferation was estimated by evaluating the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine into cellular DNA. Cell number was estimated by using a tetrazolium bromide based colorimetric method. Human RPE cells in culture expressed MYC and myc mRNA as well as prothymosin alpha mRNA--a gene whose transcription is under MYC control--indicating that MYC-dependent intracellular mitogenic pathway is active in these cells. In accordance with this, we found that blocking the expression of myc by the addition of c-myc-AS-ODN to the culture medium inhibited hRPE cell proliferation. The effect of the c-myc-AS-ODN was found to be sequence specific (the use of a control oligonucleotide with the same sequence but in an opposite direction had no effect) and dose-dependent (4 microM was the lowest effective dose tested). By using RT-PCR we found that the c-myc-AS-ODN inhibition of cell proliferation was related to a diminution in c-myc mRNA expression, and by immunofluorescence we detected a diminution in c-MYC protein staining in RPE cells after 48 hr of treatment with c-myc-AS-ODN. Furthermore, growth inhibition remained for at least 5 days after addition of a single dose of the c-myc-AS-ODN to the culture. We conclude that hRPE cell proliferation is under MYC control. Blocking the expression of myc by c-myc-AS-ODN inhibited hRPE cell proliferation. These findings establish a rationale for investigating the potential use of a c-myc-AS-ODN as a novel therapeutical tool in the treatment of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy.

TI  - Small molecule inhibitor of HIV-1 cell fusion blocks chemokine receptor-mediated function.  
AB  - The intersection of the HIV and the chemokine fields began with the observation that HIV entry into cells could be blocked by certain chemokines. Subsequent work showed that HIV entry is dependent on the presence of specific chemokine receptors. These observations led us to evaluate a series of compounds, ureido analogs of distamycin previously reported to block HIV entry into cells in vitro, for chemokine antagonist activity. One of the distamycin analogs, 2,2'[4,4'-[[aminocarbonyl]amino]bis[N,4'-di[pyrrole-2-carboxamide- 1,1'-dimethyl]]-6,8 napthalenedisulfonic acid] hexasodium salt (NSC 651016), is shown here to inhibit syncytia formation and cell fusion. Mechanistic studies showed that this inhibition was not due to conformational changes in gp120-gp41 induced by target cell CD4 and chemokine co-receptor and was therefore not due to interference with binding of HIV-1. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that NSC 651016 inhibited chemokine binding to specific chemokine receptors, induced CXCR4 and CCR5 receptor internalization, and inhibited chemokine-induced chemotaxis by macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, and stromal-derived factor-1alpha but not monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Thus, we describe a novel compound that inhibits in vivo replication of HIV-1 by down-regulation of co-receptors. These data lead us to propose that NSC 651016 may have in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.

TI  - Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis aggravates hepatic oxidative stress and enhances superoxide dismutase inactivation in rats subjected to tourniquet shock.  
AB  - The role of nitric oxide (NO) on liver oxidative stress and tissue injury in rats subjected to tourniquet shock was investigated. This shock model differs from others in that injury is a consequence of remote organ damage. Liver oxidative stress becomes evident after hind limb reperfusion, as evidenced by the loss of total tissue thiols; by increases in tissue oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation (LPO), plasma aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and (aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), and plasma nitrites; and by a 36% loss in total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Portal blood flow is reduced by 54.1% after 2 h of hind limb reperfusion.  Inhibition of NO synthesis with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or L-arginine methyl ester increased mean arterial blood pressure; further reduced portal blood flow; and aggravated liver injury as assessed by further loss in total thiols, increased LPO and GSSG content, and further increases in plasma ALT and AST. Total plasma nitrites were lower than in control animals, and total tissue SOD activity decreased by more than 80%. Treatment with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside reverted the decrease in portal blood flow and also reverted tissue thiol loss, LPO, and GSSG increases, as well as the loss of ALT and AST to plasma and of SOD activity to levels comparable to untreated control shock animals. As expected, plasma nitrites were greater than in tourniquet control animals. These data support the hypothesis that endogenous NO formation protects the rat liver from the consequences of oxidative stress elicited by hind limb reperfusion in rats subjected to tourniquet shock.

TI  - Physical association between CD155 and CD44 in human monocytes.  
AB  - Regulation of CD44-mediated binding to hyaluronan is critical in normal and diseased immune cell function. In earlier work by others (Shepley and Racaniello, J. Virol., 68, 1301 1309), anti-CD44 mAb blocked poliovirus binding to CD155 (the poliovirus receptor) in HeLa cells, suggesting that CD155 and CD44 may be physically associated. Here, we present evidence that CD155 and CD44 are physically associated in human monocytes. In co-modulation experiments in U937 monocytic cells, CD155 and CD44 reciprocally co-modulated. In primary human monocytes, CD 155 syn-capped with CD44. In immunofluorescence flow cytometric experiments, anti CD44 mAb inhibited up to 94% of binding by anti-CD155 mAb which blocks poliovirus binding to CD155.  This inhibition was specific for CD155. Culturing monocytes increased the extent of inhibition. In addition, mAb against PRR2, a novel molecule that is related to CD 155, was inhibited by anti-CD44 in a dose-dependent manner, but not by anti-CD14. These data support the interpretation that CD155 (and related proteins) are physically associated with CD44 on monocyte cell surfaces. Although the current study does not address functional significance, we speculate that this interaction may have a role in regulating monocyte CD44 ligand binding which may be critical in pathological processes such as tumor metastasis and arthritis.

TI  - Activated granulocytes oxidize the endogenous stem cell inhibitory peptide pGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys (pEEDCK) to the stimulatory dimer: a redox-mediated mechanism for demand-induced hematopoietic regulation.  
AB  - We have previously shown that the pentapeptide pGlu-Glu-Asp-Cys-Lys (pEEDCK), which is associated with mature leukocytes, maintains pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (colony-forming units-spleen [CFU-S]) in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. It is also known that its oxidation product, the disulfide-bonded homodimer (pEEDCK)2, is a growth factor for CFU-S in vivo. In this paper we report on the combined actions of the monomer and dimer in inducing rapid changes in stem cell proliferation in vivo. A single injection of 20 microg/kg synthetic dimer into mice stimulated CFU-S proliferation (60% in S-phase after 9-11 hours) and population expansion. Stimulated CFU-S traversed one cell cycle, with an estimated S-phase time of 5.5 hours, and then become quiescent again. Proliferation of CFU-S in response to dimer showed no sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of monomeric pEEDCK, whereas CFU-S proliferation did display sensitivity to inhibition after injection of cytosine arabinoside or doxorubicin. Products of mature granulocytes undergoing an oxidative burst reaction rapidly oxidized monomeric pEEDCK to the dimer. The suppressive effect of endogenous pEEDCK monomer on stem cell proliferation was thus converted within minutes to a stimulatory signal (dimer). Because many in vivo situations (e.g., infection) requiring increased hematopoiesis involve granulocyte and macrophage activation, the formation of dimer from endogenous pEEDCK monomer may provide an almost instantaneous demand-induced emergency signal for increasing stem cell proliferation and blood cell production.

YJA20379-4 markedly inhibited the H+/K+-ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and the inhibitory effect was increased under a weak acidic condition; the IC50 values were 32 and 81 microM at pH 6.4 and 7.4, respectively. The inhibition was completely antagonized by 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). In addition, YJA20379-4 showed a significant anti-H. pylori activity determined by the agar dilution method. The value of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, 3.9-11.7 microg/ml) was at least 3 times more potent than that of omeprazole. In pylorus ligated rats, YJA20379-4 inhibited basal gastric acid secretion when administered by the intraduodenal route (ED50: 23.6 mg/kg). In experimental ulcer models, YJA20379-4 administered by the oral route dose-dependently prevented the development of gastro-duodenal lesions in rats. Moreover, repeated administration of YJA20379-4 promoted the healing of gastric ulcers induced by acetic acid. On the basis of the data obtained, it is suggested that YJA20379-4 has a wide spectrum of antiulcer activities, and its mode of antiulcer actions is dependent on the inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase activity and H. pylori growth and the enhancement of a mucosal defense. Thus, YJA20379-4 might prove to be a beneficial therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcer diseases.

TI  - Docosahexaenoic acid, a constituent of fetal and neonatal serum, inhibits nitric oxide production by murine macrophages stimulated by IFN gamma plus LPS, or by IFN gamma plus Listeria monocytogenes.  
AB  - Murine macrophage activation is deficient in the fetus and the neonate, and in areas of the placenta perfused by the fetal circulation. Fetal and neonatal serum concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are 150 microM, or approximately 50-fold higher than in the adult. We previously showed that DHA inhibits activation of the gene for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in murine macrophages stimulated in vitro with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have now pursued these observations in greater depth. An assay system was developed which separated the stimulation of macrophages by IFN gamma plus LPS, and the actual production of nitric oxide (NO). It was found that macrophages do not produce NO until they have been stimulated by IFN gamma plus LPS for a period of 10 h. NO is produced during the subsequent 10 h, even though IFN gamma plus LPS are not longer present. DHA, if present, inhibited only during the initial 10 h stimulation; DHA did not inhibit the production of NO by macrophages which had previously been stimulated by IFN gamma plus LPS, and were already producing NO. It was also found that DHA was less inhibitory if given prior to the IFN gamma plus LPS stimulation. In a dose-responsive manner, DHA inhibited the increased abundance of iNOS mRNA by macrophages stimulated by IFN gamma plus LPS. NO contributes to the host defense against Listeria monocytogenes and other intracellular pathogens. We therefore investigated the ability of DHA to inhibit NO production by macrophages stimulated by IFN gamma plus Listeria monocytogenes in vitro; DHA inhibited transcription of the iNOS gene and also the listeriocidal activity of activated macrophages.  Inhibition of NO production by DHA may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the fetoplacental unit and neonate to intracellular infections.

AB  - Differential actions of acetylcholine on the excitability of two subtypes of interneurons in layer V of the rat visual cortex were examined. Acetylcholine excited low-threshold spike (LTS) cells through nicotinic receptors, whereas it elicited hyperpolarization in fast spiking (FS) cells through muscarinic receptors. Axons of LTS cells were mainly distributed vertically to upper layers, and those of FS cells were primarily confined to layer V. Thus, cortical cholinergic activation may reduce some forms of intralaminar inhibition, promote intracolumnar inhibition, and change the direction of information flow within cortical circuits.

TI  - Ionic mechanisms underlying human atrial action potential properties: insights from a mathematical model.  
AB  - The mechanisms underlying many important properties of the human atrial action potential (AP) are poorly understood. Using specific formulations of the K+, Na+, and Ca2+ currents based on data recorded from human atrial myocytes, along with representations of pump, exchange, and background currents, we developed a mathematical model of the AP. The model AP resembles APs recorded from human atrial samples and responds to rate changes, L-type Ca2+ current blockade, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibition, and variations in transient outward current amplitude in a fashion similar to experimental recordings. Rate-dependent adaptation of AP duration, an important determinant of susceptibility to atrial fibrillation, was attributable to incomplete L-type Ca2+ current recovery from inactivation and incomplete delayed rectifier current deactivation at rapid rates. Experimental observations of variable AP morphology could be accounted for by changes in transient outward current density, as suggested experimentally. We conclude that this mathematical model of the human atrial AP reproduces a variety of observed AP behaviors and provides insights into the mechanisms of clinically important AP properties.

TI  - Mothering, fathering, and infant negativity as antecedents of boys' externalizing problems and inhibition at age 3 years: differential susceptibility to rearing experience?  
AB  - To examine the effects of infant negative emotionality and of mothering and fathering during the toddler years on 3-year-old boys' externalizing problems and inhibition, as well as explore the proposition that children vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence, 125 first-born, Caucasian boys from maritally intact families were studied. Results revealed that when infant negativity is measured with objective, replicable, and discriminantly valid procedures, no relation obtains between it and externalizing problems (nor inhibition). Moreover, as hypothesized on the basis of prior work, parenting was a stronger predictor of externalizing problems and inhibition in the case of children who were highly negative as infants. Mothering proved a stronger predictor of externalizing problems and fathering of inhibition, with more negative mothering in the 2nd and 3rd year forecasting higher CBCL-externalizing scores and less negative fathering in the 2nd and 3rd year and more positive fathering in the 2nd year forecasting more inhibition at age 3 Implications of these findings for studies of parental influence are considered.

TI  - Differential inhibition of N and P/Q Ca2+ currents by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptors in spinal neurons of Xenopus larvae.  
AB  - 1. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings made from non-sensory neurons acutely isolated from the spinal cord of Xenopus (stage 40-42) larvae, two forms of inhibition of the high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents were produced by 5-HT. One was voltage dependent and associated with both slowing of the activation kinetics and shifting of the voltage dependence of the HVA currents. This inhibition was relieved by strong depolarizing prepulses. A second form of inhibition was neither associated with slowing of the activation kinetics nor relieved by depolarizing prepulses and was thus voltage independent. 2. In all neurons examined, 5-HT (1 microM) reversibly reduced 34 +/- 1.6 % (n = 102) of the HVA Ca2+ currents. In about 40 % of neurons, the inhibition was totally voltage independent. In another 5 %, the inhibition was totally voltage dependent. In the remaining neurons, inhibition was only partially (by around 40 %) relieved by a large depolarizing prepulse, suggesting that in these, the inhibition consisted of both voltage-dependent and -independent components. 3. By using selective channel blockers, we found that 5-HT acted on both N- and P/Q-type channels. However, whereas the inhibition of P/Q-type currents was only voltage independent, the inhibition of N-type currents had both voltage-dependent and -independent components. 4. The effects of 5-HT on HVA Ca2+ currents were mediated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptors. The 5-HT1A receptors not only preferentially caused voltage-independent inhibition, but did so by acting mainly on the omega-agatoxin-IVA-sensitive Ca2+ channels. In contrast, the 5-HT1D receptor produced both voltage-dependent and -independent inhibition and was preferentially coupled to omega-conotoxin-GVIA sensitive channels. This complexity of modulation may allow fine tuning of transmitter release and calcium signalling in the spinal circuitry of Xenopus larvae.

TI  -  Adenoviral-mediated inhibition of G beta gamma signaling limits the hyperplastic response in experimental vein grafts.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vein graft intimal hyperplasia is associated with changes in G protein expression. The carboxyl terminus of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (beta ARKCT) is known to inhibit G beta gamma-mediated mitogen-activated signaling pathways. This study examines the effects of adenoviral-mediated beta ARKCT infection on the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits underwent bypass grafting of the carotid artery with the jugular vein. Vein grafts were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding for beta ARKCT (n = 19), beta-galactosidase (n = 3), or empty viral constructs (n = 12). In control animals, vein grafting was performed without infection (n = 10). RESULTS: The efficacy of beta ARKCT infection in vein grafts was verified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. X-gal staining of beta-galactosidase-infected vein grafts demonstrated the transgene in cells throughout the vessel wall. Adenoviral infection of vein grafts without gene transfer did not alter wall thicknesses or sensitivities to contractile agonists, compared with control grafts. beta ARKCT infection, however, reduced intimal thickness by 36% (P < .001) and medial thickness by 24% (P < .001), compared with empty viral infection. beta ARKCT-infected vein grafts also demonstrated increased sensitivity in response to contractile agonists. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that inhibition of G beta gamma signaling with adenoviral-mediated beta ARKCT in vivo infection effectively modifies the structural and functional hyperplastic abnormalities in vein grafts.

TI  - Chronic treatment of human fibroblasts cultures with diacylglycerol induces down-regulation of p53 functional activity.  
AB  - We found that many spontaneous human tumors exhibit increased levels of endocellular diacylglycerol (DAG) which is synthesized de novo as a byproduct of glycolysis. It has been shown that DAG mimics phorbol esters as a full tumor promoter in mouse skin carcinogenesis. A short term DAG treatment activates protein kinase C (PKC), while a long term "chronic" treatment down-regulates PKC. We show here that chronic treatment of human fibroblast with DAG induces p53 down-regulation and inhibition of p53 functional activity, and protection from UV-induced apoptosis. As PKC phosphorylation is necessary for p53 functional activity, we propose that chronic DAG treatment mimics the same event occurring in vivo for the effect of glycolysis in tumor progression.

TI  - Physiological concentrations of melatonin inhibit the norepinephrine-induced activation of prostaglandin E2 and cyclic AMP production in rat hypothalamus: a mechanism involving inhibiton of nitric oxide synthase.  
AB  - In this paper, we summarize the results of in vitro studies showing that physiological concentrations of melatonin inhibit the norepinephrine-induced activation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclic AMP production in rat medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). Interestingly, a concentration of melatonin as low as 1 nM, which is roughly equivalent to the nocturnal serum physiological concentration of the hormone in the rat, significantly inhibit PGE2 and cyclic AMP production in the MBH. The suppressive effect of melatonin may be mediated by an inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, since the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a spontaneous generator of NO, was not prevented by melatonin. Melatonin also inhibited NOS activity in rat MBH in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest the existence of a new or an ancillary means by which melatonin may regulate the physiology of the hypothalamus-pituitary unit.

TI  - Dibucaine displaceable sarcolemmal Ca2+ fraction in guinea-pig cardiac myocytes.  
AB  - In previous work we found that Ca2+ bound to the internal leaflet of sarcolemma of the neonatal cultured rat cardiomyocytes may be displaced by a local anesthetic, dibucaine (DBC). This resulted in inhibition of Na/Ca exchange. Now we found that the DBC displaceable Ca2+ fraction may be demonstrated also in single, enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes of adult guinea pigs. Only cell length was used as an index of the free sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration since we found that DBC is fluorescent when irradiated with UV light, the wave length overlapping that of Indo 1 fluorescence. DBC (0.5 mM) induced a contracture whose amplitude ranged from 30%-100% of that of the electrically stimulated twitch. Blocking of Na/Ca exchange with 0.5 mM Ni2+, or 0Na+, 0Ca2+ solution did not affect the amplitude nor the time course of the contracture. Caffeine (15 mM) superfused during exposure of the cell to DBC initiated contraction which relaxed despite continued caffeine superfusion. DBC also initiated contracture in cells pretreated with thapsigargin, a blocker of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake. DBC did not initiate contracture in skinned myocytes and decreased their sensitivity to Ca2+. These results suggest that DBC displaces Ca2+ from sarcolemma and that the displacement results in inhibition of Na/Ca exchange.  Inhibition may however, be overcome by high subsarcolemmal Ca2+ concentration induced by its SR release with caffeine. DBC rapidly blocked sodium and calcium currents in voltage clamped cells. Calcium current recovered within about a minute upon washout of DBC, whereas recovery of sodium current started after about 8 min and was completed within about 12 min. Rapid depolarisation from a holding potential of -80 mV to 0 or +20 mV potentiated the response of the cell to DBC. This suggests that the Ca2+ fraction which is displaced by DBC is distinct from that released by depolarisation and therefore does not contribute to activation of a normal, electrically stimulated contraction.

TI  - Adaptation of the human pancreas to inhibition of luminal proteolytic activity.  
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion is well established in animals, and their pancreases are able to adapt to intraduodenal inhibition of pancreatic enzymes by proteinase inhibitors such as Camostate (FOY-305; Schwarz GmbH, Monheim, Germany). In this study, we addressed whether similar adaptive changes occur in the human pancreas after 4 weeks of 2 g/day Camostate application. METHODS: Before, at the end of, and 2 weeks after 4-week Camostate treatment (four times 500 mg daily), pancreatic changes were analyzed with the use of a secretin-cerulein test, a test-meal stimulation, cholecystokinin plasma measurement, and standardized ultrasonographic investigations of the pancreas. RESULTS: Duodenal trypsin output after secretion stimulation was significantly increased (+44%; P < 0.01) and duodenal bicarbonate output decreased 22% (P < 0.05) after 4 weeks of Camostate application. The size of the pancreatic head (vertical) increased 8% (P < 0.05) at week 4 and decreased to pretreatment values 2 weeks after treatment (week 6). The other three diameters measured (head oblique, body, and tail) showed a similar pattern. Stimulated cholecystokinin plasma levels 15 minutes after application of a standard test meal increased 62% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The human pancreas adapts to oral application of the proteinase inhibitor Camostate. These findings support the theory that feedback control of the exocrine pancreas operates in humans.

TI  - Genetically engineered single-chain Fvs of human immunoglobulin against hepatitis C virus nucleocapsid protein derived from universal phage display library.  
AB  - Specific single-chain Fvs (scFvs) of human immunoglobulin that specifically recognized the recombinant hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleocapsid protein were isolated from a large phage display antibody library. This universal library of genetically engineered filamentous phagemids displayed random pairings of the variable regions of both human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin in the scFv format. Specific clones were isolated by affinity selection with purified recombinant HCV protein fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The GST-specific clones were excluded by blocking the phagemid library with GST prior to the selection. After 4 rounds of selection, the HCV-reactive clones were enriched by a factor of 100,000. About 4% and 9% of the clones from rounds 4 and 5, respectively, specifically reacted to the HCV portion of the fusion protein in an enzyme immunoassay. The specificity was confirmed by specific binding inhibition with plasma from an HCV-infected individual. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 3 HCV-specific clones indicated that all 3 clones contained an almost identical VH gene sequence which was derived from the VH3 germline gene family. These clones had different VL gene sequences of the lambda type. There were some differences between nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the HCV-specific scFv genes and those of the closest matched germline genes, indicating the presence of somatic mutation. This study illustrated the feasibility of using antibody engineering technology with the universal phage display library to isolate human antibodies with predefined specificity to important microbial pathogen which may be useful for future therapeutic purpose.

TI  - An adrenocorticotropin-regulated phosphoprotein intermediary in steroid synthesis is similar to an acyl-CoA thioesterase enzyme.  
AB  - We have previously reported the purification of a phosphoprotein (p43) intermediary in steroid synthesis from adrenal zona fasciculata [Paz C., Dada, L. A., Cornejo Maciel, M. F., Mele, P. G., Cymeryng, C. B., Neuman, I., Mendez, C. F., Finkielstein, C. V., Solano, A. R., Park, M., Fischer, W. H., Towbin, H., Scartazzini, R. & Podesta, E. J. (1994) Eur J. Biochem. 224, 709-716]. Here, we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding p43 as well as the hormonal regulation of the p43 transcript. The protein resulted homologous to a very recently described mitochondrial peroxisome-proliferator-induced very-long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase (MTE-I). The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein shows consensus sites for phosphorylation by different protein kinases, and a lipase serine motif. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide that includes the lipase serine motif and against the N-terminal region of p43 block the action of the protein. The transcript of p43 was detected in ovary of pseudopregnant rats, rat adrenal zona fasciculata and glomerulosa, mouse Leydig tumor cell line (MA-10), rat brain and human placenta.  Inhibition of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) release and steroid synthesis by dexamethasone produced a dose-dependent decrease in the abundance of the adrenal transcript. The transcript was induced by in vivo stimulation of the adrenals with ACTH. The effect had a rapid onset (5 min), reached maximal stimulation (62%) at 15 min, and returned to basal levels at 30 min. The effect of ACTH on the p43 transcript was inhibited by actinomycin D and enhanced by cycloheximide. Our results provide the first evidence linking acyl-CoA thioesterases with very-long-chain specificities, and a protein intermediary in steroid synthesis, thereby supporting a regulatory role for acyl-CoA thioesterases in steroidogenic tissues.

TI  - Evidence that protein kinase Cepsilon mediates phorbol ester inhibition of calphostin C- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells.  
AB  - Protein kinase C (PKC) activators, such as the tumor-promoting phorbol esters, have been reported to protect several cell lines from apoptosis induced by a variety of agents. Recent evidence suggests that PKCepsilon is involved in protection of cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death (Gray, M. O., Karliner, J. S., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 30945-30951). We investigated the protective effects of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or by the specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C. U937 cells were transiently permeabilized with a peptide (epsilonV1-2) derived from the V1 region of PKCepsilon that has been reported to specifically block translocation of PKCepsilon. The epsilonV1-2 peptide blocked the inhibitory effect of TPA on both TNF-alpha- and calphostin C-induced apoptosis. A scrambled version of epsilonV1-2 and a peptide reported to inhibit PKCbeta translocation (betaC2-4) had no effect on the ability of TPA to inhibit apoptosis. These results suggest that PKCepsilon is required for the protective effect of TPA in TNF-alpha- and calphostin C-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, calphostin C reduced membrane-associated PKCepsilon activity and immunoreactivity, suggesting that PKCepsilon may play an important role in leukemic cell survival.

AB  - It has been reported that exhaled nitric oxide levels are reduced in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We have examined the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the airways by immunostaining and found that iNOS is constitutively expressed in the airway epithelia of non-CF mouse and human tissues but essentially absent in the epithelium of CF airways. We explored potential consequences of lost iNOS expression and found that iNOS inhibition significantly increases mouse nasal trans-epithelial potential difference, and hindered the ability of excised mouse lungs to prevent growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The absence of continuous nitric oxide production in epithelial cells of CF airways may play a role in two CF-associated characteristics: hyperabsorption of sodium and susceptibility to bacterial infections.

TI  - Growth inhibition and cytotoxicity induced by Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate in cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells.  
AB  - Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI) is a soybean-derived anticarcinogenic protease inhibitor that was shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in our previous studies. To assess the potential of BBI as a sensitizing agent for the chemotherapy of cisplatin-resistant cancers, we evaluated the effects of a soybean concentrate enriched in BBI (known as BBI concentrate or BBIC) on cell growth and clonogenic survival of a human ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, and its cisplatin-resistant sublines, C30, and C200. The presence of BBI and BBIC in the cell culture, medium reduced the clonogenic survival of the A2780, C30, and C200 cells in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced cisplatin-induced growth inhibition and/or cytotoxicity. BBIC alone showed greater inhibitory effects on growth in the cisplatin-resistant cell lines. These results suggest that BBI and BBIC could be useful agents for the treatment of cancers, especially with cisplatin, in tumors resistant to this important anticancer agent.

TI  - Effects of LTD4 on human airway smooth muscle cell proliferation, matrix expression, and contraction In vitro: differential sensitivity to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists.  
AB  - The cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) mimic many of the features of asthma and are implicated in its pathophysiology. Little, however, is known about the effects of the CysLTs on airways remodeling. In this study the effects of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) on human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cell proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix proteins were investigated. LTD4 (0.1-10 microM) alone had no effect on DNA synthesis in HASM. LTD4, however, markedly augmented proliferation induced by the mitogen, epidermal growth factor (EGF, 1 ng/ml). The potentiating effect of LTD4 (1 microM) on EGF-induced DNA synthesis was abolished by pranlukast (1 microM) or pobilukast (30 microM), but unaffected by zafirlukast (1 microM). In contrast, pranlukast (pKB = 6.9), pobilukast (pKB = 7.0), and zafirlukast (pKB = 6.5) had equivalent potencies for inhibition of LTD4-induced contraction in human bronchus. LTD4 (0.1 or 10 microM) did not increase the total messenger RNA expression of the extracellular matrix proteins (pro-alpha[I] type I or alpha1[IV] type IV collagen), elastin, biglycan, decorin, and fibronectin, and did not influence tumor growth factor-beta (10 ng/ml)-induced effects on the expression of these proteins in HASM cells. These data indicate that LTD4 augments growth factor-induced HASM proliferation but does not alter the expression of various extracellular matrix components. The observed differences in sensitivity to the antagonists suggests that the former phenomenon may be mediated by a CysLT receptor distinct from that which mediates LTD4-induced HASM contraction. Collectively, these results provide preliminary evidence that CysLTs may play a role in airways remodeling in asthma.

However, KN-62 only slightly influenced PC secretion from type II cells stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, terbutaline and ATP that are known to increase surfactant secretion via the protein kinase C and protein kinase A pathways. KN-62 also inhibited the activity of CaMK II in type II cells. A 55 kDa protein was detected in type II cells by Western blot analysis using an antibody against the beta-subunit of CaMK II. The results suggest that CaMK II participates in A23187-stimulated lung surfactant secretion.

TI  -  Inhibition of human immunodeficiency type 1 virus replication in monocytic U-937 cells by superinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of infection of monocytic cells with both the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV-1) and Chlamydia trachomatis on the replication of each pathogen. U-937 cells, chronically infected with HIV-1 (strain LaVLai), either induced to differentiate into immature macrophage-like cells by 32 pM 12-O-tetradecanol phorbol-13-acetate or uninduced, were superinfected with C. trachomatis serovar L2. Both HIV-1 infection and differentiation rendered the U-937 cells highly susceptible to C. trachomatis lytic infection. Differentiation and superinfection of HIV-1-infected cells with C. trachomatis both affected cell viability and reduced viral production in vitro. RT activity was one tenth the original value after differentiation of HIV-1-infected cells, one twentieth the original value after superinfection with C. trachomatis, and one hundredth the original value after differentiation and superinfection with C. trachomatis.

TI  - Influence of aluminum on the regulation of PTH- and 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent pathways in the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8.  
AB  - The role of hormonal status in the development of aluminum (Al)-dependent renal osteodystrophy, which is characterized by reduced bone matrix deposition, still remains largely unknown. To address this question, we used the osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8 to evaluate the role of Al on parathyroid hormone (PTH)- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)-dependent activities in these cells. Al (1 microM) caused an inhibition of basal and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced alkaline phosphatase, but only at low doses (< 1 nM) of the steroid. Al partly inhibited basal osteocalcin (OC) secretion in ROS cells (p < 0.001), and the dose-dependent increase in 1,25(OH)2D3-induced OC release by these cells was also reduced by 1 microM Al at low concentrations of the steroid (< or = 1 nM), whereas high doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 (> or = 5 nM) totally prevented the inhibiting effects of Al. Al also had strong inhibitory actions on PTH-dependent cAMP production by ROS cells over the concentration range tested (0.5-50 nM). This inhibitory action of Al was also observed for PTH-related peptide- (PTHrp, 50 nM) but not for Isoproterenol-dependent (100 nM) cAMP formation. To evaluate more fully the mechanism of this inhibition of cAMP formation, we investigated the effect of Al on toxin-modulated, G protein-dependent regulation of cAMP formation and on the activation of adenylate cyclase by Forskolin. Cholera toxin (CT, 10 micrograms/ml), applied to cells for 4 h prior to PTH challenge, enhanced cAMP production about 2-fold above PTH alone (p < 0.001), a process that was further stimulated by Al. Pertussis toxin (PT, 1 microgram/ml, 4 h) did not modify basal PTH-dependent cAMP formation by ROS cells. However, PT treatment prevented the inhibitory effect of Al on cAMP formation by these cells (p < 0.025). The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Forskolin (0.1 and 1 microM), which bypasses G protein regulation, was not modified by Al, indicating that Al does not affect adenylate cyclase directly. Northern blot analysis of PTH receptor mRNA levels showed that Al did not modify PTH receptor message in ROS cells. Likewise, Western blot analyses of G protein subunits showed that Al did not significantly alter Gs alpha subunit levels, in accordance with the results obtained for cAMP-dependent formation in response to CT. In contrast, Gi alpha-1 and Gi alpha-2 subunits were decreased by Al treatment, consistent with PT-restricted increases in cAMP formation in Al-treated ROS cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Al has multiple actions in osteoblast-like ROS cells. The effects of Al are modulated by hormonal control of the pathways investigated. Al affects 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated functions only when this steroid is low. Al has large inhibitory effects on PTH- and PTHrp-dependent cAMP formation. This last feature is related to the ability of Al to alter the G protein transducing pathway for PTH/PTHrp-dependent formation of cAMP since it does not affect adenylate cyclase activity directly and does not affect the PTH receptor message level. Thus, Al has stronger deleterious effects in osteoblast-like cells with an already compromised 1,25(OH)2D3 status and can modulate specifically PTH/PTHrp-mediated cAMP formation at the postreceptor level.

TI  - Characterization of a PSE-4 mutant with different properties in relation to penicillanic acid sulfones: importance of residues 216 to 218 in class A beta-lactamases.  
AB  - Class A beta-lactamases are inactivated by the suicide inactivators sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam. An examination of multiple alignments indicated that amino acids 216 to 218 differed among class A enzymes. By random replacement mutagenesis of codons 216 to 218 in PSE-4, a complete library consisting of 40,864 mutants was created. The library of mutants with mutations at positions 216 to 218 in PSE-4 was screened on carbenicillin and ampicillin with the inactivator sulbactam; a collection of 14 mutants was selected, and their bla genes were completely sequenced. Purified wild-type and mutant PSE-4 beta-lactamases were used to measure kinetic parameters. One enzyme, V216S:T217A:G218R, was examined for its peculiar pattern of inhibition. There was an increase in the Km from 68 microM for the wild type to 271 microM for the mutant for carbenicillin and 33 to 216 microM for ampicillin. Relative to the wild-type PSE-4 enzyme, 37- and 30-fold increases in Ki values were observed for the mutant enzyme for sulbactam and tazobactam, respectively. The results that were obtained suggested that positions 216 to 218 are important for interactions with penicillanic acid sulfone inhibitors. In contrast, V216 and A217 in the TEM-1 class A beta-lactamase do not tolerate amino acid residue substitutions. However, for the PSE-4 beta-lactamase, 11 of 14 mutants from the library of mutants with mutations at positions 216 to 218 whose sequences were determined had substitutions at position 216 (G, R, A, S) and position 217 (A, S). The data showed the importance of residues 216 to 218 in their atomic interactions with inactivators in the PSE-4 beta-lactamase structure.

TI  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the putative target of the antiapoptotic compounds CGP 3466 and R-(-)-deprenyl.  
AB  - R-(-)-Deprenyl (Selegiline) represents one of the drugs currently used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This compound was shown to protect neurons or glias from programmed cell death in a variety of models. The mechanism of action of neuroprotection as well as inhibition of apoptosis remains elusive. CGP 3466 is a structurally related analog of R-(-)-deprenyl that exhibits virtually no monoamine oxidase type B inhibiting activity but is neuroprotective in the picomolar concentration range. We showed specific binding of CGP 3466 to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by affinity binding, by affinity labeling, and by means of BIAcore(R) technology. Apoptosis assays based on the human neuroblastoma cell line PAJU established the importance of this interaction for mediating drug-induced inhibition of programmed cell death.

TI  - Fenamates inhibit contraction of guinea-pig isolated bronchus in vitro independent of prostanoid synthesis inhibition.  
AB  - The inhibitory and relaxant effects of flufenamic and tolfenamic acids on guinea-pig isolated bronchus were compared with those of verapamil and indomethacin. Flufenamic and tolfenamic acids (each drug, 20 microM) and verapamil (1 microM) inhibited bronchial contraction induced by Ca2+, KCl or PGF2alpha whereas indomethacin (20 microM) had no inhibitory effect. Only verapamil, but not flufenamic and tolfenamic acids and indomethacin, inhibited methacholine-induced contraction. Flufenamic and tolfenamic acids and verapamil (each drug, 0.1-33 microM) relaxed the bronchus precontracted by KCl or PGF2alpha. In contrast, indomethacin (0.1-33 microM) did not relax KCl- or PGF2alpha-precontracted bronchus. Verapamil, but not flufenamic and tolfenamic acids and indomethacin, relaxed methacholine precontracted bronchus. In conclusion, fenamates inhibit Ca2+-, KCl- and PGF2alpha-induced contractions in guinea-pig isolated bronchus in a manner involving inhibition of Ca2+ influx but not inhibition of prostanoid synthesis.
