TI  - Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with mitomycin C and UFT for rectal cancer.  
AB  - To evaluate the significance of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using mitomycin C (MMC) and UFT (tegafur and uracil) in combination, the Japanese Foundation for Multidisciplinary Treatment of Cancer conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with 834 patients who had undergone curative resection for rectal cancer (T3 or T4 tumors and/or N1, N2, or N3 disease). The patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group (MMC/UFT, 416 patients) and a control group (surgery only, 418 patients). For patients in the treatment group, 20 mg of MMC was sprinkled on the operating field upon completion of surgery. MMC was intravenously injected at 6 mg/m2 on day 7, and then each month after surgery for 6 months. UFT was administered orally at 400 mg/day for 1 year. Although no difference was observed in the 5-year survival rate between the two groups, the 5-year disease-free survival rate in the MMC/UFT group was 69.1%, which was significantly higher than in the control group (59.3%, P = .005). The 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate was significantly lower in the MMC/UFT group (11.6%) than in the control group (19.0%) (P = .0071). We conclude that the adjuvant use of long-term oral UFT and intermittent intravenous MMC improves the disease-free survival rate of patients with curatively resected rectal cancer.

To elucidate the relationship between the frequency of core mutations and precore mutation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Japanese HBV carriers, we investigated the nucleotide sequence of the precore/core region of HBV in 26 Japanese HBV carriers [15 who were HBe antigen-negative (HBeAg-) and 11 who were HBeAg-positive (HBeAg+)].

TI  - Association between frequency of amino acid changes in core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the presence of precore mutation in Japanese HBV carriers.  
AB  - To elucidate the relationship between the frequency of core mutations and precore mutation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Japanese HBV carriers, we investigated the nucleotide sequence of the precore/core region of HBV in 26 Japanese HBV carriers [15 who were HBe antigen-negative (HBeAg-) and 11 who were HBeAg-positive (HBeAg+)]. The number of amino acid changes (5.9 +/- 3.8) in the core region of HBV in HBeAg-carriers was significantly greater than that in the HBeAg+ carriers (1.5 +/- 1.0; P < 0.005). The precore stop codon mutation was found in 93.3% of HBeAg-negative HBV carriers, while no precore mutation was found in the HBeAg-positive HBV carriers, suggesting that the frequency of core mutations may be associated with the presence of the precore stop codon mutation. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of amino acid changes among HBeAg-HBV carriers. The mean number of core amino acid changes of liver cirrhosis patients, chronic active hepatitis patients, chronic persistent hepatitis patients, and asymptomatic carriers were 2.7 +/- 1.5, 6.0 +/- 2.2, 4.7 +/- 1.2, and 8.4 +/- 5.3, respectively. We detected hot spots for core mutations, which showed characteristic localizations and specific substitutions: Gly-87, Leu-97, and Thr-130 were detected exclusively in patients with chronic liver disease with or without HBeAg. To address further the relationship between frequency of core mutations and the presence of the precore stop codon mutation, we investigated the precore/core nucleotide sequence serially along with seroconversion in three patients with chronic hepatitis B in whom the hepatitis either became inactive or remained active after the seroconversion. Emergence of the precore stop codon mutation and a significant increase in core amino-acid changes after seroconversion were noted in all three patients. Our results suggest a close association between the frequency of core amino acid changes and the presence of the precore stop codon mutation; some characteristic core mutations may be associated with the clinical course of chronic hepatitis B in Japanese patients.

TI  - Prognostic study of gastric cancer without serosal invasion: reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early gastric cancer, a term defined by Japanese researchers in the 1960s, is equivalent to pT1 tumor stage regardless of nodal status. Recently, there were suggestions to exclude node-positive pT1 gastric cancer from this entity and to consider node-negative pT2 gastric cancer as early gastric cancer. STUDY DESIGN: A survival analysis was conducted of 294 patients who underwent resection for gastric cancers confined within the gastric wall (pT1, n = 164; pT2, n = 130) between 1986 and 1992. RESULTS: The cumulative 5-year survival rate was 93.5% for pT1 patients and 67.9% for pT2 patients, with an overall survival of 82.5%. There was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate between node-positive and node-negative pT1 patients (72.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.0095). The 5-year survival rate of node-negative pT2 patients (80.4%) was significantly worse than that of node-negative pT1 patients (p = 0.011) but was not significantly better than that of node-positive pT1 patients (p = 0.4). If excellent prognosis is a prerequisite for the definition of early gastric cancer, then node-positive pT1 cancer and node-negative pT2 cancer should not be considered early gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In the 1990s, now that new imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasonography has been introduced, the preoperative staging of gastric cancer can be made more accurately than in the 1960s, when the term "early gastric cancer" was defined. Because the prognosis of early gastric cancers, if subcategorized by nodal status, is not homogeneously excellent, a reevaluation of the definition of early gastric cancer may be necessary.

TI  - Prostate-specific antigen levels from a mass screening program using highly sensitive RIA kits.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the distribution of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of men in a mass screening program for prostatic disease. METHODS: A total of 763 men over 40 years of age underwent mass screening for prostatic disease in a Japanese prefecture using the highly sensitive Eiken kit and the Hybritech (Tandem-R) kit. The screening tests consisted of serum PSA determination, digital rectal examination, a questionnaire on symptoms, evaluation of prostate volume, and determination of the obesity rate. RESULTS: Serum PSA levels of all subjects were measured with both kits. The correlation between the values obtained by the Eiken kit and those of the Tandem-R kit was high (r = 0.990), but the values of the former were slightly higher than those of the latter. Serum PSA weakly correlated with age, however, when estimated within decade age brackets, the levels of PSA showed significant differences among only 1 pair of groups stratified by age. In contrast, the levels of PSA showed significant differences among 9 pairs of groups stratified by prostate volume. CONCLUSION: A highly sensitive assay kit is useful to evaluate both the distribution of PSA levels and the relationship of PSA values to age and prostate volume of men in mass screening programs for prostatic disease, since approximately 40% of the subjects who underwent the present mass screening showed PSA values under 1.0 ng/mL, which have been the the lower limit of detection of many PSA kits.

TI  - Three siblings of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy with isoleucine-50 transthyretin mutation.  
AB  - We herein describe three siblings with familial amyloid cardiomyopathy in a Japanese family, who demonstrated an Ile-50 mutation in the transthyretin gene. In their clinical course, the symptoms started at from 50 to 55 years of age, and two cases died within 5 years. However, one case is still alive seven years after onset probably due to either the implantation of a pacemaker for a complete atrio-ventricular block or the administration of dimethylsulphoxide. Based on our findings, some differences were observed not only in the mutation of the transthyretin gene but also in the clinical course between our cases and the previously reported cases.

TI  - Sparfloxacin in the treatment of leprosy patients.  
AB  - Seven men (age range, 20-33 years) with leprosy visited our dermatologic clinic at Yokohama City University Hospital (Table 1) and were entered into a trial of sparfloxacin (SPFX), 100-200 mg daily for up to 1 year. Five patients were Japanese Brazilians or Paraguayan from South America, and two patients were Filipinos. Examination procedures included a detailed medical history, pretreatment, clinical examinations, and body charting of the characteristic skin lesions, areas of anesthesia, and enlarged peripheral nerves. There were no deformities observed in any patient. All had presented with eruptions and neurologic problems. The diagnosis of leprosy and its type were determined by the above examination, skin smear, and histopathologic study, as well as Mitsuda reaction. The first patient came from the Philippines and presented to our clinic in 1993. There were many elevated erythemas with central healing on his whole body. Sensory nerves were impaired. His type was lepromatous (LL) leprosy. The second patient was followed for only 1 month because of a change in residence. The third and fourth patients were brothers. The fifth patient came from Paraguay. The sixth patient was from the Philippines. The seventh patient came to our clinic in April 1995.

TI  - Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis: case report and review of the literature.  
AB  - We report a case of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis in a 35-year-old Japanese woman, who came to our hospital complaining of a tender mass in her right breast. Because the results of initial aspiration cytology were considered highly suspicious for carcinoma, modified radical mastectomy was performed. However, the final histological diagnosis was granulomatous lobular mastitis with no evidence of malignancy. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare inflammatory breast disease of unknown etiology. Since the clinical manifestations are similar to those of mammary carcinoma, this condition has been misdiagnosed as carcinoma and treated as such. A review of the literature revealed that idiopathic granulomatous mastitis has tended to occur in young patients with a history of childbirth or oral contraceptive usage. Clinical or imaging diagnosis has often been difficult. Complete resection or corticosteroid therapy can be recommended as the optimal treatment. Since 38% of patients experience recurrence, long-term follow-up is indicated.

TI  - Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, and IGFBP-3 in osteoporotic patients with and without spinal fractures.  
AB  - The present study was performed to investigate the role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), and IGFBP-3 in age-dependent bone loss in postmenopausal Japanese women. One hundred and sixty-five Japanese women aged 43-88 years (mean age, 62) were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and midradius by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or single-photon absorptiometry. Serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were measured by radioimmunoassay. BMD at all sites as well as serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 declined with age, while the serum IGFBP-2 level increased with age. Serum IGFBP-3 and -2 levels were positively and negatively correlated with the serum IGF-I level, respectively. Serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels showed positive correlationship with BMD at any site, particularly at the midradius, while the serum IGFBP-2 level showed negative correlation with BMD. Multiple regression analyses showed age-independent positive correlation between the serum IGF-I level and BMD at all sites as well as age-independent positive correlation between the serum IGFBP-3 level and midradius BMD. The relationship between susceptibility to osteoporotic spinal fracture and serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3, or -2 levels was examined by decade to exclude the influence of aging. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were significantly lower in subjects with spinal fractures than those without fractures at any decade. No significant difference of serum IGFBP-2 level was observed between subjects with and without fractures. The present findings suggest that IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are important to maintaining bone mass quantitatively as well as qualitatively, and that the determination of serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels could be clinically useful to predict the severity of osteoporosis, particularly the risk of bone fracture associated with osteoporosis.

TI  - Identification of genetic mutations in Japanese patients with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency.  
AB  - Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder and may cause sudden unexpected infant death. We reported the first case of molecular diagnosis of FBPase deficiency, using cultured monocytes as a source for FBPase mRNA. In the present study, we confirmed the presence of the same genetic mutation in this patient by amplifying genomic DNA. Molecular analysis was also performed to diagnose another 12 Japanese patients with FBPase deficiency. Four mutations responsible for FBPase deficiency were identified in 10 patients from 8 unrelated families among a total of 13 patients from 11 unrelated families; no mutation was found in the remaining 3 patients from 3 unrelated families. The identified mutations included the mutation reported earlier, with an insertion of one G residue at base 961 in exon 7 (960/961insG) (10 alleles, including 2 alleles in the Japanese family from our previous report [46% of the 22 mutant alleles]), and three novel mutations--a G-->A transition at base 490 in exon 4 (G164S) (3 alleles [14%]), a C-->A transversion at base 530 in exon 4 (A177D) (1 allele [4%]), and a G-->T transversion at base 88 in exon 1 (E30X) (2 alleles [9%]). FBPase proteins with G164S or A177D mutations were enzymatically inactive when purified from E. coli. Another new mutation, a T-->C transition at base 974 in exon 7 (V325A), was found in the same allele with the G164S mutation in one family (one allele) but was not responsible for FBPase deficiency. Our results indicate that the insertion of one G residue at base 961 was associated with a preferential disease-causing alternation in 13 Japanese patients. Our results also indicate accurate carrier detection in eight families (73%) of 11 Japanese patients with FBPase deficiency, in whom mutations in both alleles were identified.

TI  - Population genetics of a functional variant of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (DBH).  
AB  - Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.17.1; protein abbreviation: DbetaH) catalyzes conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. Previous work identified two expressed alleles of the gene encoding DbetaH (locus symbol DBH), containing either G or T at nucleotide position 910, resulting in specification by codon 304 of alanine (DBH*304A) or serine (DBH*304S), respectively. The current study employed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to identify these alleles, and after developing a PCR RFLP for rapid genotyping, estimated the frequencies of the alleles in African-Americans, European-Americans, and in several geographically dispersed populations (Mbuti, Danes, Adygei, Chinese, Japanese, Surui, Maya, and Nasioi). DBH*304A was the most common allele in all populations tested, with allele frequencies greater than 0.80 in each case. There was significant heterogeneity in allele frequency across population groups. The DBH*304S allele was most common in subjects of African descent, and least common in East Asians and individuals from indigenous populations of North and South America. The frequency of DBH*304S was significantly higher in African-Americans (0.16) than in European-Americans (0.06; P < 0.004). Of the four DBH*304S homozygotes observed, all were Europeans and three of the four were Danes. Based on empirical P-values generated by computer simulation, the observed proportions of DBH*304S homozygotes did not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations in any of the populations after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The observation of significant heterogeneity in DBH*304S allele frequency across different population samples demonstrates the importance of controlling for population stratification in future studies testing for associations between DBH*304S and clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins: form, function, and recombinant vaccine development.  
AB  - No products of the biotechnology revolution will likely have a greater legacy than recombinant vaccines. Clinical efficacy trials of new acellular pertussis vaccines have recently been completed; among them, a vaccine containing a genetically modified pertussis toxin showed superior effectiveness in protection against disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. The foundations for this vaccine derive from the work of many investigators, but most notably: Japanese researchers who demonstrated the potential for subcomponents of B. pertussis, and particularly pertussis toxin, to confer protective immunity; research teams in Italy and the United States who cloned and sequenced the pertussis toxin operon; and our own group who molecularly dissected the toxin molecule to produce recombinant analogs of this heterohexameric protein that retained protective immunogenicity yet lacked the intrinsic enzyme activity that results in the adverse reactogenic effects of immunization. Another result of the research leading to this new pertussis vaccine is an intimate understanding of the relationship between form and function in the ADP-ribosylating toxins with AB5 architecture, including the structure of their catalytic domains their immunologic and adjuvant properties, characteristics and possible pathologic consequences of host cell receptor recognition, and the assembly and subunit interactions of these complex multimeric proteins.

TI  - Combined polymorphism associated with a 3-bp deletion in the 5'-flanking region of a tetrameric short tandem repeat at the CYP19 locus.  
AB  - Allele frequencies for a tetrameric short tandem repeat locus, CYP19, were determined in 220 unrelated Japanese individuals. The frequency distribution was similar to that of a previous report. However, PCR amplification using two sets of primers suggested that one allele consisting of 7 TTTA repeats (the allele 7) was divided into two separate ones, 7P (standard) and 7(-3), which differed in length for 3 bp. Sequence analysis of the two alleles revealed that the smaller 7(-3) had a 3-bp deletion in the 5'-flanking region of the tetrameric repeat. The deletion was also observed as the allele 7(-3) in non-Japanese such as Caucasians and Africans; it was only found in a part of the allele 7 [7(-3)], but not in the other alleles, in all examined populations. In the Japanese population, the deletion was observed in 39.6% of the allele 7, or 24.8% of all of the alleles. When the STR polymorphism at the CYP19 locus was combined with the polymorphic deletion adjacent to the repeat region, the numerical indices of genetic polymorphisms (heterozygosity, polymorphism information content and the power of discrimination) in Japanese rose from 0.541, 0.46 and 0.723 to 0.723, 0.66 and 0.864, respectively. Accordingly, the combined polymorphism at the CYP19 locus can be considered appropriate for hereditary analysis in the field of forensic science.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Molecular and clinical features of 35 Japanese patients including one homozygous for the CAG repeat expansion [see comments]  
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a newly classified autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) associated with CAG repeat expansion. We screened 111 patients with cerebellar ataxia for the SCA6 mutation. Of these, 35 patients were found to have expanded CAG repeats in the SCA6 gene, indicating that second to SCA3, SCA6 is the most common ADCA in Japan. Expanded alleles ranged from 21 to 29 repeats, whereas normal alleles had seven to 17 repeats. There was no change in the CAG repeat length during meiosis. The age at onset was inversely correlated with the repeat length. The main clinical feature of the 35 patients with SCA6 was slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia; multisystem involvement was not common. The 35 patients included nine cases without apparent family history of cerebellar ataxia. The sporadic cases had smaller CAG repeats (21 or 22 repeats) and a later age at onset (64.9 +/- 4.9 years) than the other cases with established family history. We also identified one patient who was homozygous for the SCA6 repeat expansion. The homozygote showed an earlier age of onset and more severe clinical manifestations than her sister, a heterozygote carrying an expanded allele with the same repeat length as the homozygote. This finding suggests that the dosage of the CAG repeat expansion plays an important role in phenotypic expression in SCA6.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences of expression regarding depressed mood between Japanese and Canadian aged people. METHOD: The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) was applied to people aged 65 and over in Ohira, Japan, and Steveston, British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: The number of subjects who filled out the SDS completely was 2180 for the Japanese sample and 183 for the Canadian sample. The mean SDS indexes of the Japanese and the Canadian samples were 44.03 and 44.34, respectively. The Canadian sample showed a higher average score in 11 items out of 20, whereas the Japanese sample showed a higher score on only 4 items. The factor analysis of those samples showed only small differences. CONCLUSIONS: The Canadian sample showed a higher average score in more items compared with the Japanese sample. This indicates that Canadian aged people express their depressed moods more clearly and spontaneously than Japanese aged people.

AB  - It is well-known that Takeo Doi tried to describe Japanese culture using the Japanese term "Amae". However, with many Japanese students of psychotherapy pointing out that his use of the term was arbitrary, his Amae-theory fell into confusion. Actually, with the single word Amae, he explained many heterogeneous psychological phenomena including pathological dependency as well as maternal separation. In this paper, I use my own clinical observations to clarify the Amae-phenomenon and define it as follows: The "Aame" the Japanese usually experience in daily life differs from both pathological dependency (which M. Balint described as "ocnophilia"), and an affinity for friendly expanses in the therapeutic depressive position (described by M. Balint as "philobatism", by me as "sumu-akirameru"; c.f. Keiichi Nagayama: Considerations on the Guilt Feeling towards Mother and Maternal Separation using the Japanese Keywords "Sumu-Akirameru" and "Sumanai", Psychiatria et Neurologica Japonica, 96: 83-108, 1994). In psychotherapy, Japanese patients only become able to form Amae connections with others after experiencing the two opposites (ocnophilia and philobatism) mentioned above. Although Amae is phenomenologically different from those extremes, it consists of two elements carrying some attributes from those extremes. One element consists of interpenetrating and mutually interdependent personal relations in a small familiar group; and the other element is a kind of protective and harmonious space in which the Japanese enjoy "temporary and partial regression in the service of the ego". As these two elements are both present in Amae, where dependence and independence are concerned, Amae toes the midline and has a double meaning. A fundamental principle of interpersonal relationships in Japanese society, Amae calls upon members of a small group to be moderately individualistic. If a member lacks ego flexibility regarding Amae and cannot obey this principle, he cannot adapt to a small familiar group. From the Western standpoint of individuality, Amae and interpenetrating personal relations in Japanese society must be regarded as regressive phenomena, whereas, for the Japanese, Amae is a personal skill necessary for social adaptation. Whereas Sumu-Akirameru (Nagayama) and Philobatism (Balint) are ontological phenomena that tend to avoid external objects, Amae involves the need for relationships and is a somewhat socialized phenomenon in Japan. Although Amae and Sumu-Akirameru are different phenomena, they share several characteristics: 1) both tend towards protective harmonious spaces which have both specialty and boundaries; 2) things arise spontaneously and unintentionally in both phenomena; 3) the Japanese use both to confirm their sense of self; 4) both have the qualities of "corporality" and "living in". Because of these common areas, the Japanese tend to perceive Sumu-Akirameru and Amae as one experience, although they are different, separate phenomena. This tendency leads the Japanese to group behavior patterns, and unconsciously forces them into a double bind between individualization and group behavior patterns. This cultural tendency and phenomenological ambiguity of Amae itself allow the Japanese to easily project many kinds of psychological phenomena onto Amae. It is this projection deeply rooted in Japanese culture that confused the Amae-theory (Doi). Clarification of this cultural tendency not only contributes to the stu

TI  - A new competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrates adequate immune levels to rabies virus in compulsorily vaccinated Japanese domestic dogs.  
AB  - A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) was developed as an alternative to the viral neutralization (VN) test for rapid and simple detection of antibodies to rabies virus. The competitor antibody in the c-ELISA was a biotinylated monoclonal antibody to the nucleoprotein of rabies virus. Initial comparisons showed a high correlation between titers obtained with the VN test and the c-ELISA (n = 88, r = 0.90), indicating that the c-ELISA could be used as a reliable substitute for the VN test. To evaluate the immune status of Japanese dogs to rabies virus, a total of 1,019 serum samples were collected from domestic dogs in 1994 and tested for antibodies with the c-ELISA. Overall, 84.8% of the dogs had antibodies against rabies virus, indicating that the vaccination strategy for preventing rabies outbreaks in domestic dogs is probably sufficient in Japan. Dogs receiving final vaccinations a year or more previously were 48.3 and 90.3% positive for antibodies when vaccinated once only or two or more times, respectively. This suggests that almost all dogs vaccinated twice or more remain seropositive for over 1 year in Japan.

TI  - [Effects of long-term administration of alfacalcidol on bone mass and bone metabolism in patients with primary osteoporosis--comparison with calcium preparations]  
AB  - Long-term administration of active vitamin D3 can reduce the loss of bone mass and the incidence of fractures in Japanese whose intake of calcium (Ca) is low. In a crossover study, we examined the safety and efficacy of 1 alpha (OH)D3 and combination therapy with a Ca preparation. We measured bone mass, the incidence of fractures and bone metabolism in 33 elderly patients with a high risk of fracture (mean age: 77.5 %/- 7.8 (SD) years). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive calcium lactate alone for 12 months after 12 months of combination therapy with 1 alpha (OH)D3 (1 microgram/day) (A-C group, 17 patients) or to take calcium lactate alone for 12 months and then undergo 12 months of combination therapy with 1 alpha(OH)D3 (C-A group, 16 patients). These subjects were followed for 24 months. In the A-C group, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine (L2-4 BMD) measured 6 months after the start of 1 alpha (OH)D3 administration was 3% higher than the baseline value. In the C-A group, L2-4 BMD measured 6 months after the start of calcium lactate administration had decreased by approximately 2%. The rate of decrease was the same 12 months after the start of administration. The differences in L2-4 BMD between the two groups 6 and 12 months after the start of administration were significant (p = 0.023 and p = 0.005, respectively). In the A-C group, the mean BMD of the distal one-third radius measured 6 months after the start of administration had increased by 5%, but the increase was 1% when measured 12 months after the start of administration. In the C-A group, there were no such changes. The incidence of vertebral fracture during combination therapy with 1 alpha(OH) D3 and Ca preparations in the A-C group was significantly lower than that in the C-A group (chi square test, p < 0.05). The serum Ca level in the C-A group gradually increased, as measured 6 and 12 months after the start of combination therapy with 1 alpha(OH) D3 and Ca preparations, although these changes were within the reference range. There was no hypercalciuria. Serum intact parathyroid hormone levels had decreased from 26.5 +/- 11.3 pg/ml and 30.7 +/- 10.3 pg/ml to 19.8 +/- 9.7 pg/ml and 25.5 +/- 9.6 pg/ml in the A-C group and the C-A group, respectively, by 6 months after the start of administration. The rate of decrease was significantly higher in the A-C group (p = 0.004). These findings suggest that long-term administration of 1 alpha(OH)D3 is safe even when combined with administration of Ca preparations, and that this agent inhibits parathyroid function, and thus prevents loss of bone mass and reduces the incidence of vertebral fracture.

TI  - A case of episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gleich et al. first described 4 cases of episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia as a distinct entity in 1984. Since then, several cases of this disorder have been reported in the United States, Europe and Japan. OBSERVATIONS: We report a case of a 22-year-old pregnant Japanese woman with this disorder. She had no fever and her general condition was good except the angioedema which was limited to her limbs. During an acute episode, her white blood cell count increased to 29,500/mm3 with 50% eosinophils, following an elevated serum interleukin-5 (IL-5) level. Spontaneous resolution occurred in 1 month after the onset. In a 5 month follow-up, no evidence of cardiac or other visceral organ involvement was found, and no recurrence occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our case, combined with those reported in the literature, suggests that Japanese cases of episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia differ from Caucasian cases in clinical symptoms and some other points.

TI  - Esophageal atresia in Osaka: a review of 39 years' experience.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: One hundred fifty-nine patients who had esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula have been treated at Osaka University Medical School and its affiliated hospitals since the initial (Japanese) experience of Dr T. Ueda in 1957. METHODS: These cases were divided chronologically into three groups. With earlier recognition of surgical neonates and the development of perinatal care, the long-term survival of these patients has steadily improved over 39 years from 28% in the first period (1957 to 1967) to 80% in the third period (1980 to 1995). Of 141 patients treated in the second and third periods (1968 to 1995), 92 (65.2%) had associated anomalies. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal malformations were the most frequently seen major anomalies. VATER or VACTER association was seen in 12.8% (18 of 141) of these patients. Survival of these cases according to Waterston risk factors was 100% for group A, 100% for group B, and 50% for group C, whereas the new classification proposed by Spitz showed survival of 92% for group 1, 50% for group 2, and 0% for group 3, showing better differentiation among the three groups. RESULTS: There was a long gap between the proximal and distal esophageal ends in seven patients (type A), in all of whom primary anastomosis was possible after 28 to 128 days of elongation by bouginage. Although the survival of esophageal atresia patients dramatically improved in recent years, there is still a high incidence of early and long-term postoperative complications, ie, anastomotic leakage (26.5%), recurrent fistula (7.2%), anastomotic stricture (49.1%), postoperative pneumonia or atelectasis (57.0%), tracheomalacia (25.8%), and gastroesophageal reflux (52.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Recently, there have been changing patterns in the occurrence of complications, which are mainly attributed to technical improvement, better perinatal care and early recognition of pathophysiologic conditions such as tracheomalacia and gastroesophageal reflux.

TI  - Organ transplanting in Japan: the debate begins.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Japan is currently considering changing its long-standing policy of banning most organ transplants. This paper reviews the current state of organ transplantation in Japan and presents results from a recently conducted survey regarding attitudes toward the removal of organs from brain-dead donors, and potential methods of allocating those organs in a fair manner. METHODS: Survey data were collected by the Research Project Team on Network Systems for Organ Transplants funded by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. The sample consisted of 1093 randomly selected citizens. Predictors of attitudes supporting organ transplantation were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Although many Japanese people support organ transplantation, few are willing to donate their organs. General knowledge of transplantation was the best predictor of support for such a program and willingness to donate organs. In addition, younger respondents and male respondents were more likely to support programs and donate organs. Implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - We report a 40-year-old Japanese woman with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). She had a history of miscarriage at the age of 27 followed by pulmonary embolism 3 weeks later. At the age of 40, she developed diplopia, bilateral ptosis and easy fatigability. Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and tensilon test were positive. She was diagnosed as having MG. The laboratory test revealed mild thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and positive findings for both beta 2-glycoprotein I-dependent anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant. She fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of APS, but did not the criteria proposed by American Rheumatism Association for SLE. An extended total thymectomy was performed after administration of oral prednisolone and low-dose aspirin. This is a patient who had APS associated with MGs: both are known to result from autoimmune abnormality. The clinical and laboratory manifestations of APS were ameliorated after removal of the thymus, suggesting that thymectomy alleviates APS symptoms.

TI  - Folie a deux in Japan -- analysis of 97 cases in the Japanese literature.  
AB  - In order to clarify the characteristics of folie a deux in Japan, we examined a total of 97 cases of folie a deux in the Japanese literature covering a period of 90 years, and compared them with the cases reported in Western countries. About 75% of the Japanese cases occur in two individuals, and of these are family cases. The most common combinations are mother-child and married couple. Mother-child combinations are much more common than father-child combinations. Female subjects are more often involved than males. The most common diagnosis for the dominant partner is schizophrenia, and the most common diagnosis for the submissive partner is paranoid reaction. Delusion is the most common symptom shared by both partners in Japan. Comparing these Japanese cases to Western ones, sister-sister combinations are less frequent, younger subjects influence the older ones more, and acute religious delusion is more common in Japan than in Western countries.

TI  - Malignant histiocytosis-like B-cell lymphoma, a distinct pathologic variant of intravascular lymphomatosis: a report of five cases and review of the literature.  
AB  - Malignant histiocytosis (MH)-like B-cell lymphoma (BCL) is a neoplastic proliferation of large B cells clinically characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, haemophagocytosis and abnormal laboratory data, without lymphadenopathy or skin lesions. Interestingly, most cases have been reported in Asian patients, and it is unclear whether MH-like BCL is biologically distinct from conventional large B-cell lymphomas.  We report five Japanese patients with MH-like BCL. Biopsied specimens of bone marrow, liver and/or spleen showed infiltration of neoplastic B cells accompanied by haemophagocytosing histiocytes. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD19, CD20 and HLA-DR surface antigens, and negative for CD5 and CD10. In four cases elevated serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and the soluble IL-2 receptor isoform were noted, but not IL-1beta, IL-2 or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Autopsies of two cases were pathologically diagnosed as intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL). Based on these observations, the current and nine previous cases reported as MH-like BCL in Japan were re-evaluated. They appear to form a peculiar variant of IVL, characterized by bone marrow involvement at presentation, haemophagocytic syndrome, and a rapidly aggressive clinical course, but rarely neurological complications or skin lesions. This variant may merit separate consideration because of the problems posed in the initial diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Two decades of annual medical examinations in Japanese obese children: do obese children grow into obese adults?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in frequency of obese children in Japan over two decades, the frequency of obese children who grow into obese adults and predictive factors for adult obesity. DESIGN: Annual cross-sectional studies for 22 y (1974-1995) with a follow-up study. SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional: Cumulatively 13,186 obese (% of standard body weight (SBW): > or = 120%) schoolchildren including 3158 extremely obese (> or = 140% of SBW) children out of 203,088 schoolchildren (age: 6-14 y) in Izumiohtsu City, Osaka, Japan. Follow-up: 151 initially obese children (initial age: 6-14 y and age at follow-up: 20-35 y) who lived in Izumiohtsu City. Control: 3552 Japanese men and 4631 Japanese women (age: 20-35 y). MEASUREMENTS: Cross-sectional: height, weight, trunk circumference, skin-fold thickness, blood pressure and blood biochemicals. Follow-up: height, weight, trunk circumference, skin-fold thickness during childhood, and body height and weight at follow-up. Adulthood obesity: > or = 120% of the average body mass indices (BMI) of the controls. RESULTS: Frequency of obese children increased from 5% to more than 10%, and that of extremely obese children increased from 1% to more than 2% during these 22 y. These increases were most prominent in the schoolboys aged 9-11 y. Prevalence of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in the extremely obese children did not change, and that of hypertension and abnormal liver function gradually decreased during these two decades. After coming of age, 32.2% of the initially obese boys (relative risk: 5.3) and 41.0% of the initially obese girls (relative risk: 6.7) remained obese. BMI, percentage of the SBW and skin-fold thickness at the biceps during childhood were significantly larger in currently-obese girls. Positive correlations were demonstrated between these variables and percentage SBW at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity is increasing in Japan, especially in boys aged 9-11 y. Approximately 32% of the obese boys and 41% of the obese girls grow into obese adults, and the degree of obesity is a predictive factor for adult obesity.

TI  - Plasmacytoma of the gastrointestinal tract in Korea: higher incidence than in Japan and Epstein-Barr virus association.  
AB  - As a result of a systematic review of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) at the Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea and the Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, we found an extramedullary plasmacytoma in 5 of a total of 78 cases (6.4%) in Korea and 1 of 136 cases (0.7%) in Osaka, which represents an approximately 9-fold difference in frequency. The presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome was examined in paraffin-embedded specimens from the 5 cases with GI plasmacytoma from Korea together with 17 patients collected by a nationwide study in Japan. There were no clinical findings suggestive of the presence of immunodeficiency in these Korean and Japanese patients. There were no prominent differences in the age distribution or sex ratio between the patients of the two countries. Histologically, the proliferation of mature plasma cells was almost monomorphous with occasional bi- or multinucleated forms. The immunohistochemistry revealed a restricted cytoplasmic expression of immunoglobulin light chain, kappa type in 8 cases and lambda type in 14. A polymerase chain reaction of preserved DNA from 4 Korean and 16 Japanese patients found that only 2, both Korean, were positive for EBV of subtype A. The difference in the frequency of EBV positivity between Korean and Japanese cases was significant (p < 0.05). In situ hybridization revealed positive signals in the nucleus of the tumor cells. IHC revealed that the tumor cells in these two cases were positive for latent membrane protein-1 and EB nuclear antigen-2, showing latent infection of EBV. These findings suggest a close association of EBV and Korean GI plasmacytoma, and might partly explain the remarkable number of cases in this country.

TI  - Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden interview.  
AB  - Despite a rapid increase in disabled elderly in Japan, the burden of the caregiver has not been properly assessed due to a lack of objective measurements. Our study was aimed at adapting and validating the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) in Japan, which is one of the most widely used measurements for caregivers' burden in the United States. Sixty-six caregivers answered the self-administered questionnaire, involving the Japanese version of the ZBI and questions regarding their caregiving situation. Our study demonstrated that the Japanese version of the ZBI had equally as high reliability and validity as the original version. The Japanese ZBI had a high test-retest reliability (r = 0.76) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93). The total score of the ZBI was highly correlated with the caregivers' score of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score (r = 0.50), as well as a single global rating of burden (r = 0.71). It was also shown that demographic distribution of the score of the Japanese version had a similar trend to that of the original version. Caregivers who looked after patients with behavioral disturbances were found to have a significantly higher ZBI score than those who looked after patients without behavioral disturbances, which is consistent with previous findings. It is concluded that the Japanese version of the ZBI can be used to measure feelings of burden of caregivers in the Japanese population and can be used for cross-cultural comparison.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In view of the many studies of early stage colorectal carcinoma from Japan, it is essential to know whether the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma are similar in Japan and Western countries. METHODS: Eight expert pathologists from Japan (4), North America (2), and Europe (2) individually reviewed microscope slides of 20 colorectal lesions from Japanese patients who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection or surgery because early stage carcinoma and/or adenoma was suspected. The pathologists indicated the pathologic findings on which they based each diagnosis. RESULTS: For 11 slides that showed adenoma according to the Western pathologists with low grade dysplasia according to at least half of them, the Japanese diagnosed definite carcinoma with or without adenoma in 4 cases and adenoma in 5, and in 2 cases they were equally divided between a diagnosis of adenoma and carcinoma. For five slides showing adenoma with high grade dysplasia according to the Western pathologists, the Japanese diagnosed definite carcinoma with adenoma in three cases and adenoma in one, and in one case they were equally divided between a diagnosis of adenoma and carcinoma. For one case in which the Western pathologists were equally divided between a diagnosis of carcinoma and adenoma with high grade dysplasia, all the Japanese pathologists diagnosed definite carcinoma with or without adenoma. Three slides showed definite carcinoma with or without adenoma, according to both the Western and the Japanese pathologists. The presence of invasion was the most important diagnostic criterion of colorectal carcinoma for the Western pathologists, whereas for the Japanese the nuclear features and glandular structures were more important. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, colorectal carcinoma is diagnosed on the basis of nuclear and structural criteria, even in cases considered by Western pathologists to be noninvasive lesions with low grade dysplasia. This diagnostic practice may contribute to the relatively high incidence of early stage colorectal carcinoma reported in Japan as compared with Western countries.

TI  - Plasma insulin, metabolite concentrations, and carcass characteristics of Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, and Holstein steers.  
AB  - To characterize some of the physiological features of Japanese beef breeds, plasma concentrations of insulin and metabolites and carcass composition were measured in five Japanese Black, five Japanese Brown, and four Holstein steers (6.2 mo; 164 kg). The steers were raised under typical feeding conditions in Japan until they were slaughtered at 600 to 700 kg BW. Blood samples were collected at 8 mo of age (average BW, 194 kg) and at 300, 400, 500, and 600 kg BW. Plasma insulin concentrations increased with BW in all three breeds and were greater (P < .05) in Japanese Blacks than in the Japanese Browns or Holsteins at 400 and 600 kg BW. The Japanese Blacks exhibited lower (P < .05) plasma glucose levels at 300, 400, and 600 kg BW compared with Holsteins. Regardless of the breed, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentrations increased with BW. The two Japanese breeds had greater (P < .05) PUN levels than Holsteins at 300 and 600 kg BW. Total cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations tended to decrease above 300 kg BW in the Holsteins; however, the concentrations of both metabolites were elevated in the steers of Japanese breeds at 500 and 600 kg BW (P < .05). Breed did not affect the plasma concentrations of albumin, triglycerides, and NEFA. The Japanese breeds had higher (P < .01) dressing percentage, greater (P < .05) carcass fat proportion, and a lower proportion of carcass bone (P < .01) than the Holsteins. These results indicate that there are breed differences in plasma levels of insulin and certain metabolites and carcass composition among Japanese breeds and Holstein.

TI  - Mutations of CLCN5 in Japanese children with idiopathic low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.  
AB  - The annual urinary screening of Japanese children above three years of age has identified a progressive renal tubular disorder characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. The disorder has been observed in over 60 patients and has a familial predisposition. Mutations of a renal chloride channel gene, CLCN5, have been reported in four such families, and we have undertaken studies in additional patients from 10 unrelated, non-consanguineous Japanese families to further characterize such CLCN5 mutations and to ascertain their prevalence. CLCN5 abnormalities we identified in 7 of the 10 unrelated patients and consisted of 5 mutations (2 nonsense, 1 frameshift and 2 missense), 1 deletion and 1 silent polymorphism. A clustering of these mutations in CLCN5 exons 8 and 10 was observed. Over 80% of the CLCN5 mutations could be readily detected by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, thereby providing a useful mutation screening method. Our results, which indicate that over 70% of Japanese patients with this renal tubulopathy have CLCN5 mutations, will help in the genetic and clinical evaluation of children at risk from this disorder.

TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of decay-accelerating factor deficiency in Cromer blood group Inab phenotype.  
AB  - An additional decay-accelerating factor (DAF) mutation, designated as Inab phenotype in the Cromer blood group system, was recently identified in a 28-year-old Japanese woman (H.A.). The red blood cells of H.A., like those of other Inab phenotype individuals, were negative for Cromer system antigens, Cra, Tca, Dra, UMC, and IFC. The deficiency of DAF on the red blood cells of H.A. has been shown by immunoblotting with a murine monoclonal antibody to DAF. Molecular analysis has shown that H.A. is homozygous for a single nucleotide substitution, C1579-->A, at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3'-end of exon 2 of the DAF gene. This substitution causes the activation of a novel cryptic splice site and results in the production of mRNA with a 26 bp deletion. The deletion introduces a reading frame shift and creates a stop codon immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of mRNA would be terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus repeat (SCR2) domain (exon 3) of DAF. The functional domains of DAF's complement regulatory activity and the carboxy-terminal signal domains for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring are predicted to be lacking in H.A. Thus, there would be no DAF present on the cell surface.

TI  - Metabolic disposition of pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, in relation to S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation phenotype and genotype.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the possible relationship between the metabolic disposition of pantoprazole and genetically determined S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation phenotype and genotype. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic disposition of pantoprazole was investigated in 14 Japanese male volunteers (seven extensive and seven poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin). All subjects received a single 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole as the enteric-coated formulation. RESULTS: An interphenotypic difference in the metabolic disposition of pantoprazole was observed: the mean values for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), elimination half-life (t1/2), and apparent oral clearance were significantly (p < 0.01) greater, longer, and lower, respectively, in the poor metabolizers than in the extensive metabolizers. The mean AUC of pantoprazole sulfone was greater (p < 0.01) in the poor metabolizers than in the extensive metabolizers, whereas the mean AUC of the main demethylated metabolite (M2) was lower (p < 0.01) in the poor metabolizers than in the extensive metabolizers. A significant negative correlation was observed between the individual values for log10% urinary excretion of 4'-hydroxymephenytoin and AUC of pantoprazole (rs = -0.816; p < 0.005). The CYP2C19 genotyping test results were found to be in a complete accordance with the phenotypes. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that the metabolic disposition of pantoprazole is under the pharmacogenetic control of S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19).

TI  - Infrequent genetic alterations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in Japanese patients with primary cancers of the breast, lung, pancreas, kidney, and ovary.  
AB  - In the present study, we searched for genetic alterations of the entire coding region of PTEN/MMAC1, a recently isolated candidate tumor suppressor gene, in 178 specimens from Japanese patients with various malignant tumors by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method. The samples consisted of 11 glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs), 14 astrocytomas, 47 breast cancers, 25 non-small cell lung cancers, 9 small cell lung cancers, 8 pancreatic cancers, 24 renal cell carcinomas, 20 ovarian cancers, and 20 metastatic lung tumors from various organs. Only one somatic frameshift mutation at codon 319 was observed in one (9%) of eleven GBMs. Our results suggest that mutation of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene does not play a major role in carcinogenesis, at least in the tumor types from Japanese patients analyzed in this study.

TI  - Germline mutations of the MEN1 gene in Japanese kindred with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.  
AB  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome. The responsible gene MEN1 has recently been isolated, and its germline mutations have been identified in affected individuals in the United States, Canada and Europe. We screened for MEN1 mutations by direct nucleotide sequencing of all protein-coding regions, and identified five distinct germline mutations in five among six Japanese kindreds with familial MEN1 or familial hyperparathyroidism. The mutations were dispersed across the gene. These findings suggest that, because of the absence of an obvious founder effect, the entire MEN1 gene region should be examined for germline mutations in the probands of MEN1 and related syndromes in Japanese families.

TI  - A new compound heterozygous mutation (W17X, 436 + 5G --> T) in the cytochrome P450c17 gene causes 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.  
AB  - A genetic disorder in cytochrome P450c17 results in 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency. In the present study, a Japanese patient with 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency underwent molecular analysis. The patient presented with complete female genitalia with a 46,XY karyotype, absent pubertal development, and hypertension. the exons and exon-intron boundaries of P450c17 genetic region were amplified and sequenced. DNA sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation. One allele showed a G to A transition corresponding to a premature termination codon at tryptophane in codon 17 (W17X). The other allele showed a G to T substitution at the fifth nucleotide from the splice donor site in intron 2 (436 + 5G --> T). W17X was found in one allele of the father, and 436 + 5G --> T was found in one allele of the mother. A previous report presented a patient with 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency who was homozygous for W17X. However, the present case is a novel 436 + 5G --> T mutation. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis using total ribonucleic acid isolated from the testes of the patient revealed that an intron 2 donor site mutation caused abnormal splicing, such that exon 2 was spliced with intron 2. Skipping the exon alters the translational reading frame of exon 3 and introduces a premature termination codon. In semiquantitative analysis, the majority of the transcript for 436 + 5G --> T skips exon 2. The present findings indicate that in this patient, 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency was caused by the compound heterozygous mutation of exon and splice site mutation in cytochrome P450c17 gene.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is an increasingly recognized clinicopathologic condition. We report two cases of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in middle-aged Japanese women whose clinical and laboratory data mimicked autoimmune hepatitis. Histologic findings of both cases were definite steatohepatitis with portal and pericellular fibrosis. Both patients' HLA-DR haplotypes were DR4 and DR2, which are frequently observed in Japanese patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Our cases suggest a diversity in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

TI  - Sudden cardiac death in Japanese people aged 20-60 years--an autopsy study of 133 cases.  
AB  - In order to elucidate the principal cause and actual circumstances of sudden cardiac death in Japan, especially among people in the prime of life, we investigated 133 out of 161 autopsied patients (82.6%) (106 men and 27 women, mean age 47.5 years). Coronary artery disease (CAD) was the most frequently detected disorder (50 cases, 37.6%), and included 15 cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (11.3%). We found that CAD was less frequent among younger patients than in Western countries: 10.0% in subjects in their twenties and 22.2% among subjects in their thirties. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was the vessel most often affected by infarction (47.0%), but the proportion of LAD lesions was not different from that in AMI patients who were survived for least 1 day after the attack. In conclusion, CAD was infrequent among patients aged 20-39 years in comparison with Western countries and LAD was the most commonly affected vessel, but the proportion was not different from that found among AMI patients who survived for at least 1 day after the attack.

TI  - Risk factors of moyamoya disease in Canada and the USA.  
AB  - Over the past 28 years, 39 patients with Moyamoya disease or syndrome defined as spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis with extensive basal collateral vessels have been treated by the author in Canada and the USA. All patients presented with clinical or radiologic evidence of hemorrhage (23) or ischemia and infarction (16). A total of 12 patients had associated cerebral aneurysms and seven of these patients with aneurysms presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patients ages ranged from 5 to 47 years. Of these 58% were female. The patients racial origin included North American Indian, Innuit, East Indian/Pakistani, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Malayasian, Hispanic, African American and Caucasian. Familial clustering was seen in North American Indian, Innuit and Caucasian patients. Associated disorders (tuberculosis, pharyngitis, thalassemia, fibromuscular hyperplasia, polycystic kidney, sickle cell trait and hypertension) were common in these patients, as was the use of tobacco, alcohol and in the adult females, oral contraceptives. It may be concluded from this series that the etiology of Moyamoya disease or syndrome is probably multifactorial, but that some racial and familial groups are more susceptible. Furthermore, in that the clinical and angiographic features are identical, the separation between Moyamoya disease and syndrome may not be helpful in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of this disorder.

AB  - To both clarify the current clinico-epidemiological features of Moyamoya disease in Korea as well as compare these cases with Japanese patients, 451 cases were collected from 26 Korean major neurosurgical institutes and 296 definite cases were analyzed statistically. Although the Korean age distribution patterns of Moyamoya disease showed two peaks, similar to Japanese patients, the Korean pattern was shifted to the right thus indicating Korean adult population to be 20% higher than that of Japanese patients. The female/male ratio was 1:3, which was slightly less than that for Japanese. The family occurrence rate in Koreans was 1.8%. The incidence of cerebral infarction and bleeding in Koreans was higher while transient ischemic attack (TIA) and seizure were less than that of Japanese. The incidence of infarction in children and of hemorrhage in children and adults were also statistically higher in Koreans. The incidence of hemorrhage was higher in females than in males. Both the age at onset and sex affected the disease type. Single encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) was performed on 87.6% of all surgical cases. Although the incidence of bleeding was higher in Korea, the outcomes of the patients were similar to that of the Japanese patients. Although Korean Moyamoya disease showed a relatively higher incidence of hemorrhage and adult onset, the overall clinical background was similar to that of Japanese patients.

The goal was to clarify whether the flushing response inhibits adolescent drinking. Students with the flushing response reported drinking significantly less than nonflushers with respect to both frequency and amount. Although the flushing response was associated with less drinking, the flushers and nonflushers had similar drinking partners and reasons for drinking, and their total Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale scores did not differ significantly. The survey showed that many flushers were seeking the pleasures of alcohol despite the discomforts it caused, suggesting that Japanese adolescents need more education on the risks of adolescent drinking.

AB  - We determined the incidence of actinic keratosis (AK) among Japanese by screening for skin cancer in Kasai City, Hyogo, Japan, between 1993 and 1995. The incidence per 100,000 Japanese residents was 223.6 in 1993 and 171.2 in 1994. The prevalence of AK was 291.2 per 100,000 residents in 1993, 203.7 in 1994, and 86.8 in 1995. The prevalence in people who had more than six seborrheic keratoses on sun-exposed body sites and in people who had experienced severe sunburns with blister formation during childhood were significantly higher. These results indicate that more than six seborrheic keratoses and several episodes of blister formation in childhood may be risk factors for AK in the Japanese.

TI  - Impact of family history on the risk of breast cancer among the Japanese.  
AB  - To assess the impact of family history on the risk of developing breast cancer, a case-referent study was conducted using data from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center (HERPACC), Japan. In total, 1,551 breast cancer cases were included and 28,450 women, confirmed as free of cancer, were recruited as the reference group. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by using an unconditional logistic regression model. Stratification by age at diagnosis was done to evaluate the impact of family history on early (< 40 years of age) vs. later (> or = 40 years of age) onset. New findings obtained from the present study were as follows. 1) For women having a family member with ovarian cancer, the OR for breast center diagnosed under age 40 was 5.04 (95% CI: 1.48-17.1). 2) The effect of family history on the risk of breast cancer was greater when a sister(s) was (were) positive (OR = 3.51) than when the mother was positive (OR = 1.47). 3) The estimated proportional ratio (PR) for breast cancer was 2.63 (95% CI: 2.05-3.38) among sisters excluding probands, while PR for cancers other than breast cancer was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.94-1.27). This result suggested that a family history of breast cancer, especially among sisters, elevated the risk of developing breast cancer. Furthermore, when women had a sister(s) with breast cancer diagnosed prior to 40 years of age, their family history of breast cancer affected their risk of cancer of the breast and other organs.

Mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with Apert syndrome.

TI  - Mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with Apert syndrome.  
AB  - Apert syndrome is a clinically distinctive condition characterized by craniosynostosis, mid-face hypoplasia, and severe symmetrical syndactyly of the hands and feet. Recently, mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene have been associated with several craniosynostosis conditions including Apert, Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, and Pfeiffer syndromes. Mutations detected in Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, and Pfeiffer syndromes are located at several sites in the FGFR2 gene. However, the mutational spectrum in Apert syndrome is remarkably narrow. Mutations detected thus far in Caucasian patients with this syndrome are exclusively transversions from cytosine to guanine at either nucleotide position 934 (C934G) or 937 (C937G) in the FGFR2 gene. To examine the possibility that the narrow mutational spectrum in Apert syndrome was a result of racial or environmental predilection, we studied three Apert syndrome patients from two unrelated Japanese families for C934G and C937G mutations. The C934G mutation was found in all three patients. This is the first demonstration of FGFR2 gene mutations in Japanese patients. Our evidence that the C934G mutation identified in Caucasian patients also occurs among Japanese patients excludes the possibility of racial or environmental predilection for this mutation. Nucleotide position 934 is a mutational hotspot of the FGFR2 gene in Japanese patients as well, although the mechanism by which the mutation occurs remains to be clarified. Whether C937G is a mutational hotspot in Japanese patients as well remains to be determined.

TI  - The effect of sperm-oocyte incubation time on in vitro embryo development using sperm from a tetraparental chimeric bull.  
AB  - The present study was designed as 5 x 4 factorial to investigate the effects of using sperm from 5 bulls, and varied sperm-oocyte incubation times (5, 10, 15 and 20 h) on the fertilization, cleavage rates and blastocyst formation on an in vitro bovine embryo production system. The bulls included a tetraparental Chimera, its sires (Japanese Black and Limousin), its maternal grand-sires (Japanese Brown and Holstein). The proportion of polyspermy, 2-pronuclei formation, fertilization, cleavage and development to blastocyst were affected (P < 0.001) by the duration of sperm-oocyte incubation, as well as by the interaction between bulls and their corresponding sperm-oocyte incubation time. Blastocyst rate observed after 5 h in oocytes inseminated with Chimera, Japanese Black and Limousin were higher (p < 0.05) than those observed at 20 h incubation. The proportion of blastocysts from oocytes inseminated with Japanese Black observed at 10 h of incubation did not differ from that of Chimera, but both were higher (p < 0.05) than those observed for the Limousin, Japanese Brown and Holstein sires. The present study showed that there was an effect by the duration of sperm-oocyte incubation on in vitro embryo development. The optimal time of sperm-oocyte incubation for the Chimera was similar to that of its sires (Japanese Black and Limousin) but differed from its maternal grand-sires (Japanese Brown and Holstein). The fertilization rates for the sperm from the Holstein bull increased up to 15 h suggesting that this might be the only bull that would benefit from a long incubation period for insemination.

TI  - Effects of Japanese black tea on atherosclerotic disorders.  
AB  - The atherogenic index was found to be significantly better in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with black tea extract than in the ones not given the extract. It was also evident that black tea inhibited the proliferation of smooth muscle cells involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, and suppressed the production of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, a cause of lipid accumulation. It thus seems likely that black tea has an antiatherosclerotic action.

TI  - Balancing function of the masticatory muscles during incisal biting in two murid rodents, Apodemus speciosus and Clethrionomys rufocanus.  
AB  - The functional significance of masticatory muscle direction was estimated using a mechanical model in two murid rodents: the Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and the gray red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus). Theoretical analyses of the data suggest that a balancing mechanism among the muscle forces occurs during incisal power stroke. The activation of the large deep masseter in both murids results in marked tensile separation of two hemimandibles at the flexible mandibular symphysis. Activation of the internal pterygoid decreases this large tensile force at the symphysis more efficiently than other muscles. The lines of action of the deep masseter and internal pterygoid are aligned to produce such a balancing function in both species studied here. The resultant force generated by the deep masseter on both sides is opposite in direction to the reaction force at the lower incisor tip. Therefore, the large deep masseter forms an effective mandibular support mechanism when the reaction forces during biting push the mandible downward. Because of the area of insertion and the line of action, the posterior temporalis appears to have an important role in stabilizing the position of the mandibular condyle in the glenoid fossa during incisal biting.

TI  - Diagnostic fibrohysteroscopic evaluation of perimenopausal and postmenopausal uterine bleeding: a comparative study with Belgian and Japanese data.  
AB  - The most appropriate hysteroscope is the smallest that allows one to perform a biopsy. We use a 3.5- or 4.9-mm Olympus flexible hysteroscope with a failure rate below 3% for office or hospital ambulatory procedures without anesthesia or cervical dilatation. In postmenopausal women (with no hormone treatment) with uterine bleeding, we do not perform hysteroscopy if vaginal sonography detects endometrial thickness less than 4 mm. At this cut-off limit the calculated risk for not detecting an endometrial abnormality is 5.5%. In all other patients we prefer fibrohysteroscopy because its diagnostic accuracy is higher than that of vaginal ultrasound, vaginal ultrasound can easily miss a focal lesion of hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma incipiens, and abnormal endometrial findings detected by vaginal ultrasound or sonohysterography require directed biopsy during hysteroscopy. A comparative study evaluated the experience in our two series (286 patients), a Belgian report (251), and a Japanese report (444). Apart from myoma, 50% of findings were atrophic normal endometrium, and concordance was good for detecting adenocarcinoma (+/-3%). The results suggest using the fibrohysteroscope rather than the rigid scope because of its excellent accuracy.

TI  - Mutation analysis in the iduronate-2-sulphatase gene in 43 Japanese patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter disease).  
AB  - Our series of studies on Hunter disease in Japanese patients showed allelic heterogeneity of IDS gene mutations, genotype/phenotype correlation and racial differences in distribution of mutations. Twenty-five different small mutations have been characterized. Small mutations in the Japanese population are widely distributed through the IDS gene, although some mutations were unevenly concentrated on exon 5 (28%) and on exon 9 (24%). Mutations were seen at the same codon 468 in exon 9 in 5 patients. These findings are in good agreement with data on other ethnic groups. Two unique mutations linked to a severe phenotype were apparently associated with aberrant splicings; one was a point mutation within exon 3 (P86L), partially activating a cryptic splice acceptor site at 28 bp downstream from the mutation site within exon 3 and producing a 44-base truncated mRNA, and the other was a point mutation at the consensus sequence of the splice donor site of intron 2, causing exon 2 skipping.

TI  - Mutation in the exon 10 (R173W) of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene in two unrelated Japanese families with acute intermittent porphyria.  
AB  - Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (EC 4.3.1.8.; HMBS), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. To date, 113 different HMBS gene mutations have been reported in the world. However, there were a few reports of the gene mutations in the Japanese AIP patients. We studied the gene mutation in two unrelated AIP families in the San-in district, a local area of Western Japan. The overlapping 6 fragments of the HMBS gene, amplified by the reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction, were analyzed by the single-strand conformation polymorphism with silver staining technique. The abnormal fragment from a member of one family was sequenced to detect the C to T substitution at 517 nucleic acid position of cDNA, which led to a missense mutation of arginine to tryptophan exchange at an amino acid level (R173W). This mutation located in exon 10 created a new site of the MSP 1 restriction endonuclease and was screened by the amplified fragment of exon 10 from genomic DNA with the MSP 1 digestion. The mutation was detected totally in three members of the family and interestingly also in two patients of an unrelated family. This mutation has been reported widely in the world independently, such as in a Swedish, a Canadian, a Finnish, and a French family, but is the first in Japanese patients. The screening method for this mutation is useful for diagnosis in Japanese AIP patients.

AB  -  A 10-year-old Japanese Black cow showed icterus with gradual emaciation for a period of 3 months. Ultrasonography demonstrated increased "echogenicity" of the entire liver, with marked dilatation of the gall-bladder. At necropsy, the common bile duct was found to be obstructed by focally thickened fibrous tissue adjacent to a flesh-like mass (9 x 4 x 4 mm) attached to the wall of the duct. The mass consisted of normal pancreatic tissue. The liver showed moderate fibrosis, with nodular regeneration of the hepatic tissue and bile duct hyperplasia. A diagnosis of biliary cirrhosis secondary to ectopic pancreas in the common bile duct was made.

TI  - No association detected between very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Hong Kong Chinese.  
AB  - The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a risk factor in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a receptor for ApoE, very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) might be involved in AD pathogenesis. A Japanese study [Okuizimi, K., et al., Nature Genet., 11 (1995) 207-209] has shown an increased 5 and decreased 8 CGG-repeat allele frequency in the 5' untranslated region of VLDLR in Japanese AD versus normal controls (N). Subsequent studies in Caucasian Americans failed to duplicate the result. We examined this polymorphism in pathologically- or clinically-diagnosed Chinese late-onset AD. Our data did not show a significant increase in the 5 CGG-repeat in AD, thus suggesting no association to VLDLR. However, our data did show that the allele frequencies for each CGG-repeat were similar in both Chinese and Japanese.

TI  - The interaction of preserved pragmatics and impaired syntax in Japanese and English aphasic speech.  
AB  - Elicited narrative studies have shown that the underlying pragmatic factor of empathy is relatively preserved in aphasic speakers of Japanese and English (7 Japanese and 14 English-speaking aphasics of varied diagnostic types). Occasional "reversal errors" can be explained in terms of a conflict between the normal encoding of the empathic characteristics of an event and the syntactic limitations imposed by impaired production processes. To account for these findings, we propose a production model following Levelt (1989) for making pragmatic choices among syntactic forms. We also suggest that preferential access to "canonical form" might be a matter of surface morphosyntax, rather than involving semantics or more abstracts levels of syntax.

AB  - The new Japanese GCP enacted on the basis of ICH-GCP adopts more clear concepts of quality assurance for a clinical trial. This article briefly describes its principles. Sponsors are now responsible not only for initiation but also for management of clinical trials. Thus, discussions have been under taken the points to be considered in, among others, imple mentation/maintenance of the Quality Assurance/ Control systems, preparation/amendment of a clinical trial protocol, entrusting to a coordinating investigator/committee, monitoring, audit, and direct access to source documents and all other trial-related records. Further, this addresses the required reorganization which the sponsor should strive for as well as the sponsor's requests to participating medical institutions such as adoption of a "study coordinator". To improve the quality of a clinical trial, it would be necessary to refer not only to GCP but also to other current guidelines such as those harmonized at the ICH.

TI  - Clinical similarities of hereditary progressive/dopa responsive dystonia caused by different types of mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary progressive dystonia with pronounced diurnal fluctuation [(HPD)/dopa responsive dystonia (DRD)] is a childhood onset dystonia which responds to levodopa. Various clinical signs and symptoms of HPD/DRD have been recognised to date. Mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CH-I) gene were recently identified as the cause of HPD/ DRD. In the present study, the GTP-CH-I gene and the clinical features of eight HPD/DRD patients from six families were analysed to determine the correlations between clinical expression and the mutations in the GTP-CH-I gene. METHODS: The exons, exon-intron junctions, and an indispensable part of the 5' flanking region of the GTP-CH-I gene were sequenced in the eight clinically diagnosed patients with HPD/DRD and their asymptomatic parents. RESULTS: Three independent mutations in the GTP-CH-I gene were found in three patients. One of the patients and her asymptomatic mother were heterozygous for a novel mutation at the initiation codon. The three patients with dissimilar GTP-CH-I mutations exhibited similar clinical features. The other five patients with normal sequences presented several features not manifested by the three patients with the mutations. No mutation was found in the 5' flanking region of any patients or their parents. CONCLUSIONS: A novel initiation codon mutation was found in a Japanese patient with HPD/DRD. The clinical manifestations common to the patients with HPD/ DRD with a mutated GTP-CH-I gene were also identified. Although focal manifestations of HPD/DRD associated with the mutations of this gene will be broadened, it is inferred that these clinical features are fundamental to HPD/DRD caused by mutations in this gene.

TI  - Effect of chronic administration of alcoholic beverages and seasoning containing alcohol on hepatic ethanol metabolism in mice.  
AB  - Five-week-old male mice, C3H/HeNCrj (C3H/He), were given a 5% (v/v) ethanol solution, commercial alcoholic beverages (Japanese sake (sake) or red wine) or a Japanese seasoning (mirin [containing ethanol and a large amount of glucose]) ad libitum for 45 d, and were then examined for changes in the hepatic enzymes related to ethanol metabolism 2 h after oral administration of 5 g of ethanol/kg body weight. The specific activity of aniline hydroxylase (ANH) in the hepatic microsome increased significantly in all groups chronically administered ethanol solution, sake, red wine or mirin, and the greatest increase was in the hepatic microsome of mirin-administered mice. The cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2E1 increased in the hepatic microsome of the mice administered ethanol solution, red wine or mirin where accompanied by high ANH activity. The immunoreactive band for CYP1A1 showed high specificity in the microsome of mice given sake, red wine or mirin. It was assumed that CYP1A1 was induced by unknown component(s) other than ethanol in these solutions. In the cytosolic fraction, following the chronic administration of sake and mirin, the total aldehyde dehydrogenase (A1DH) activity with high-Km decreased significantly. In the mitochondrial fraction, the activity of high-Km A1DH increased significantly in the mirin-administered mice which drank a large amount of ethanol, whereas that in the red wine-administered group tended to decrease. These results indicate that the enzyme activities related to the oxidation of both ethanol and acetaldehyde in the cytosolic, mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of the liver were affected by either the action of ethanol or its interaction with other constituents of sake, red wine and mirin.

In order to clarify the genetic relationships between Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica, and the Japanese triploid forms of Fasciola, we compared nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. Intraspecific variation in the ND1 and COI sequences was low, except for 1 specimen of F. gigantica in the ND1 sequence. The ND1 and COI sequences of Japanese triploid forms of Fasciola were nearly identical to those found in F. gigantica but were different from those of F. hepatica. Thus, the Japanese triploid forms of Fasciola are thought to be categorized as F. gigantica.

TI  - [The majority of emergency calls are erroneous]  
AB  - An emergency call system has been used to summon specialists for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in Kumamoto University Hospital since 1986. Many improvements have been made to the system since it was established. We performed a prospective evaluation of calls made during the period from April 1, 1996 to March 31, 1997. There were a total of 36 calls, but only two of them were judged to be true emergencies. While at first we considered the number of calls reflected a growing awareness of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation team in the hospital, the large number of erroneous calls (94%) indicated other factors needed to be considered. Further investigation revealed the existence of a special, and little-known, telecommunication system connecting various administrative offices of the Japanese Government. Some of the phone numbers in this system are similar to the emergency call number. Thus many of the emergency calls were probably caused by administrative officers who misdialed. We are proposing to change this emergency call number.

TI  - Association study of a functional catechol-O-methyltransferase gene polymorphism in Japanese schizophrenics.  
AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme which inactivates catecholamine neurotransmitters by methylation, and is considered a candidate for involvement in schizophrenia. A functional COMT gene polymorphism influencing the enzyme activities, the high activity (val-108) and the low activity allele (met-108), was recently confirmed. We investigated a genetic association between schizophrenia and the COMT gene polymorphism in 150 Japanese schizophrenics and controls. We detected the low activity met-108 allele more frequently in schizophrenics than in the controls, and found that subjects sharing the met-108 allele (val/met and met/met) are significantly more common in the patients than in the controls. The results suggest that the low activity met-108 allele may be involved in susceptibility for schizophrenia.

TI  - Staging and extended resection for pancreatic cancer.  
AB  - Extended surgery is being widely performed to treat pancreatic cancer in Japan, but it has not been evaluated in the same way as in other countries. We, therefore, compared the Japanese Stage Classification (JPN-SC) with the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer Stage Classification (UICC-SC) in the surgical cases of pancreatic cancer treated in our department and then assessed the results of extended resection and associated problems. Problems existed in the resection rates and actuarial survival rates in stages II and III in the UICC-SC, and the JPN-SC was found to reflect more accurately the outcome. On the other hand, although improvements in curative resection and actuarial survival rate have been achieved as a result of extended resection in Japan, the outcome in JPN-SC surgical stage IVb and highly advanced cases in which these resections proved to be noncurative even though they were classified as surgical stage IVa was extremely poor. In the future, it will be necessary to decide on a single-stage classification that is accepted throughout the world and to conduct prospective studies matched to the degree of tumor progression.

AB  -  A 40-year-old Japanese man with psoriatic arthritis (PA) involving the spine, sacroiliac and peripheral joints presented with dyspnoea and ankle oedema. Blood pressure was 180/110 and 114/80 mmHg in the right and left upper arms, respectively. Examinations showed left ventricular dilatation and diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle, with no involvement of the coronary arteries. Aortography detected total occlusion of the left subclavian artery and stenosis of the origin at the right renal artery. Dilated cardiomyopathy and Takayasu's arteritis associated with PA was diagnosed. A few cases of PA have been reported in association with cardiovascular diseases, but the association of these three diseases has not been documented in the literature to date. Dermatologists need to be aware of cardiovascular manifestations in patients with PA, because cardiovascular diseases are not rare in other seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

TI  - Relationship between area under the concentration versus time curve of cyclosporin A, creatinine clearance, hematocrit value, and other clinical factors in Japanese renal transplant patients.  
AB  - We evaluated the relationship between the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of cyclosporin A (CsA) and several other clinical factors, because the clinical utility of AUC monitoring has been ambiguous. Fifty-four clinical time courses from 14 Japanese renal transplant patients during hospitalization, in the period from April 1990 to March 1997, were examined. In a bivariate regression analysis there was no correlation between the AUC and the daily dose of CsA (mg/kg/day) when the individual data or total series data were analyzed. In a chi-square test, the donor type of kidney (chi(2) = 25.254, df = 1, p = 0.0000) and renal function-related episodes, i.e. acute tubular necrosis, hemodialysis, hypertension, nephrotoxicity, or rejection (chi(2) = 13.982, df = 1, p = 0.0002) directly affected posttransplant renal function assessed by creatinine clearance, while episodes of hepatic function as assessed by the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activity level had no correlation with the posttransplant renal function evaluated according to creatinine clearance. In contrast, the renal function-related episodes significantly affected the AUC after renal transplantation (chi(2) = 4.934, df = 1, p = 0.0263), while hepatic function assessed by GPT did not. In a multivariate analysis, the creatinine clearance and obesity had significant positive correlations with the AUC, whereas the hematocrit had a significant negative correlation with the AUC. From these observations, we concluded that the dosage adjustment of CsA cannot be performed using the linear relationship between the daily oral dose and the AUC, and that renal function, obesity, and the CsA blood distribution properties affect the CsA pharmacokinetics after renal transplantation. Posttransplant renal function as well as obesity and CsA blood distribution properties are important factors to be considered when therapeutic monitoring is performed.

TI  - Improvement of a mouse feeder for chemical toxicology testing.  
AB  - A mouse feeder in common use in the US was modified to eliminate spillage, contamination by excreta and formation of food aggregates. The improved feeder consists of a glass jar which holds 100 g of meal-type feed, an inner metal mesh tube, a marble placed inside the inner mesh tube, and a snap-on metal lid. Female mice [B6C3F1 and CD-1(ICR)] were housed 5 animals/cage. Only slight contamination by feces, but not by urine, was observed in a 13-week feeding study with Japanese meal-type food and the improved feeder. Food spillage also decreased. Food consumption was significantly higher in cages with the conventional Japanese feeder than in the improved one, but no difference was observed between the two feeders in body weight gain.

TI  - Characterization of the flanking regions of the S-RNase genes of Japanese pear (Pyrus serotina) and apple (Malus x domestica).  
AB  - Genomic sequences of the self-incompatibility genes, the S-RNase genes, from two rosaceous species, Japanese pear and apple, were characterized. Genomic Southern blot and sequencing of a 4.5-kb genomic clone showed that the S4-RNase gene of Japanese pear is surrounded by repetitive sequences as in the case of the S-RNase genes of solanaceous species. The flanking regions of the S2- and Sf-RNase genes of apple were also cloned and sequenced. The 5' flanking regions of the three alleles bore no similarity with those of the solanaceous S-RNase genes, although the position and sequence of the putative TATA box were conserved. The putative promoter regions of the Japanese pear S4- and apple Sf-RNase genes shared a stretch of about 200bp with 80% sequence identity. However, this sequence was not present in the S2-RNase gene of apple, and thus it may reflect a close relationship between the S4- and Sf-RNase genes rather than a cis-element important in regulating gene expression. Despite the uniform pattern of expression of the rosaceous S-RNase genes, sequence motifs conserved in the 5' flanking regions of the three alleles were not found, implying that the cis-element controlling pistil specific gene expression also locates at the intragenic region or upstream of the analyzed promoter region.

TI  - [Clinical diagnosis of thrombosis and blood coagulation tests]  
AB  - Blood coagulation tests are useful to diagnose some thrombotic diseases. Particularly, these tests are valuable for the diagnosis of familiar thrombophilia, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). For the diagnosis of thrombophilia, determinations of both biological activity and antigen level of antithrombin III, protein C and protein S are important for initial screening. Since activated protein C (APC) resistance is extremely rare in Japanese, APC resistant test that based on APTT, is unnecessary to include as one of the screening tests. Detection of activity and antigen level of either plasminogen or fibrinogen is recommended to screen the plasminogen deficiency or dysfibrinogenemia. Determination of lupus anticoagulant is needed for the diagnosis of APS. At this time, the dilute phospholipid APTT (dAPTT) or the dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) may be useful as a screening test for LA because procedure of these tests are basically simple to perform in Japanese laboratory. In the next step, cross mixing test of dAPTT (or APTT) should be perform to make a diagnose of LA more solid. Final confirm tests can be conveniently carried out with kit of either STACLOT or LA-CONFIRM. Platelet count and FDP (or FDP D dimer) assay are two essential tests for the diagnosis of DIC. Criteria of diagnosis for DIC recommended by Blood Coagulation Research Group of Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare is not unnecessarily appropriate for practical use. TAT and PIC can be a good laboratory tests for early detection of hypercoagulable state in patients with DIC.

AB  -  A 44-year-old Japanese male showed a high value of HbF (14.3%) in an assay of glycated Hb (HbA1c) by use of HLC-723GHb II system. The proband was asymptomatic although he was found to be anemic ten years ago. The hematological examination revealed microcytosis, hypochromia and slight reticulocytosis (3.7%). Serum iron level was high (245 g/dl). Blood smear revealed aniso-poikilocytosis with scattered target cells. Hb analysis showed a remarkable increase of HbA2 (8.6%) as well as the high HbF cited above, but no abnormal Hb was detected. The beta/alpha ratio of globin biosynthesis in reticulocytes was decreased to 0.25. DNA sequencing of the beta-globin gene disclosed that the proband was homozygous for beta (+)-thalassemia mutation-31CapA-->G. This mutation was linked to A gamma T gene and haplotype -(-)+2(-)+2-. His parents and two daughters were heterozygous for the mutation. They were anemic and had increased HbA2 levels of 4.36-5.43%. The beta/alpha ratios of globin biosynthesis were 0.61-0.81.

TI  - High proportion of missense mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Japanese breast cancer families.  
AB  - Mutations in either of two recently identified genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are thought to be responsible for approximately two-thirds of all cases of autosomal-dominantly inherited breast cancer. To examine the nature and frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Japanese families exhibiting a high incidence of breast cancer, we screened 78 unrelated families in this category for mutations of these two genes. Examining the entire coding sequences as well as exon-intron boundaries of both genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and multiplex-SSCP analysis, we identified possible disease-causing alterations in BRCA1 among affected members of 15 families and in BRCA2 in another 14 families. In 15 of those 29 families, the affected individuals carried missense mutations, although most germline mutations reported worldwide have been deletions or nonsense mutations. Our results, indicating that missense mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 tend to predominate over frameshifts or nonsense mutations in Japanese breast cancer families, will contribute significantly to an understanding of mammary tumorigenesis in Japan, and will be of vital importance for future genetic testing.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in Japanese adult patients.  
AB  - Population pharmacokinetic parameters of vancomycin (VCM) in Japanese adult patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were estimated using 1253 items of serum concentration data from 190 patients obtained in routine drug monitoring. The two-compartment linear model was adopted, and VCM clearance (CL) was correlated with the creatinine clearance (CLcr), which was observed or estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The population pharmacokinetic analysis program NONMEM with first-order conditional estimation method was used. The results showed VCM clearance to be linearly correlated with CLcr (CL [ml/min] = 0.797 x CLcr) when the estimated CLcr was <85 ml/min, but no linear relationship at higher than this level because of the lack of accuracy in the CLcr estimates. The interindividual variability of CL was 38.5%; K12 and K21 were 0.525 hr(-1) and 0.213 hr(-1), respectively. The distribution volume at steady state (V[SS]) was 60.71, with no significant dependence on the actual body weight. The interindividual variability of Vss was 25.4%. The calculated half-life (t1/2,beta) in a typical patient with CLcr of 85 ml/minute was 12.8 hours. Residual variability was 23.7%. These results were compared to those of healthy volunteers, and guidelines for dosage adjustment in VCM therapy are discussed.

TI  - Comparison of the functional properties of three different truncated thyroid hormone receptors identified in subjects with resistance to thyroid hormone.  
AB  - The tau4 domain in the extreme carboxyl (C) terminal region of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) is important to transactivation. We identified three truncated TRbeta1s with 11 (F451X), 13 (E449X) and 16 (C446X) amino acid deletions within this domain in subjects with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). F451X and C446X were found in a 6-year-old Japanese girl and a 31-year-old American male, respectively, who had both severe mental retardation. E449X was identified in a 16-year-old Japanese boy with no remarkable clinical symptoms except for goiter. Transient expression study revealed that all three mutants had negligible T3 binding and transcriptional activities. Each mutant TRbeta1 exhibited not only very strong dominant negative activity against wild TRbeta1, but also marked silencing activity. Interestingly, the dominant negative activity and silencing activity were significantly stronger in F451X than in E449X and C446X (P < 0.05). Gel-shift experiments revealed no apparent differences in homodimer formations of wild-type or mutant TRbeta1 proteins and in heterodimer formations with retinoid X receptor (RXR). These observations indicate that the tau4 domain affects diverse TR functions, and that the region between 11 and 13 C-terminal amino acids influences ligand-independent TR functions, including dominant negative and silencing activities. The central nervous system involvement is not necessarily determined by the dominant negative potency of the mutant TRbeta1 and other environmental or genetic factors may influence the RTH manifestations.

TI  - Distribution of cerebellar cortical lesions in multiple system atrophy: a topographic neuropathological study of three autopsy cases in Japan.  
AB  - We investigated neuropathologically the distribution of the cerebellar cortical lesions in three Japanese autopsy cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) using hemisphere specimens. The lesions were classified as mild, moderate or severe. The distribution of cerebellar cortical lesions in all three cases were uniform: the cerebellar cortical lesions were more conspicuous in the vermis than in the hemisphere. These neuropathological findings differ from the established theory that cerebellar lesions of MSA are more pronounced in the hemisphere than in the vermis. The degree of cerebellar cortical lesions in our cases increased in relation to the duration of the disease. Our pathological data may contribute to the morphological differential diagnosis in various neurodegenerative disorders including late cortical cerebellar atrophy. Our neuropathological findings may also make a contribution to the neuroradiological progress in the differential diagnosis of spinocerebellar disease.

TI  - Otx cognates in a lamprey, Lampetra japonica.  
AB  - Gnathostomes have two lineages of Otx genes, Otx1 and Otx2, as cognates of a Drosophila head gap gene, orthodenticle. Previous studies with mutant mice have demonstrated that they play essential roles in the development of rostral head. To shed lights on the evolution of the rostral head in vertebrates we isolated their cognates in the Japanese marine lamprey, Lampetra japonica. The lamprey genome appeared to have two Otx cognantes, LjOtxA and LjOtxB. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that LjOtxA clusters with gnathostome Otx2 genes, but LjOtxB does not belong to either the Otx1 or Otx2 lineage. LjOtxA was expressed in the forebrain and midbrain with the caudal limit possibly at the midbrain/hindbrain junction as gnathostome Otx cognates are, but LjOtxB was not expressed in the brain. No Otx1 or Otx2 cognates are known in gnathostomes that are not expressed in the brain. Both LjOtxA and LjOtxB were expressed in the olfactory placode, epiphysis, optic stalks, and lower and upper lips. LjOtxB was also expressed in the eyes, where no LjOtxA transcripts were detected. Thus, Otx1 and Otx2 functions for the development of forebrain and midbrain in gnathostomes appear to be shouldered by LjOtxA alone in the lamprey. LjOtxB may have diverged from the stem of the Otx1 and Otx2 lineages and evolved independently.

TI  - Association of HLA class I and class II alleles with myositis in Japanese patients.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of HLA class I and class II antigens and alleles with various forms of myositis in Japanese patients. METHODS: Eighty-four Japanese patients with myositis [22 with polymyositis (PM), 46 with dermatomyositis (DM), 16 with myositis overlapping with other collagen vascular diseases] were typed serologically for HLA-A, B, C antigens. HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction dependent DNA typing methods. Fifty-eight Japanese controls were typed serologically while HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 allele typing was carried out in 175, 95, and 104 controls, respectively. RESULTS: HLA-B7 was higher in patients than controls [20.2 vs 6.9% in controls: p=0.02, odds ratio (OR)=3.4]. The increase of HLA-B7 was largely dependent on the increase in overlap patients (37.5%; p=0.005, OR=8.1). HLA-A24 and B52 were significantly decreased in PM as compared to DM, while CW3 was significantly increased in PM versus DM. DRB1*08 alleles were significantly increased in patients (36.9 vs 20.5% in controls; p=0.004, OR=2.3), especially in PM and DM. DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0301 were significantly decreased in patients [4.8 vs 13.7% in controls; p=0.04, OR=0.32, and 8.3 vs 20.2% in controls; p=0.02, OR=0.36, respectively]. CONCLUSION: HLA-class I and class II alleles associated with Japanese patients with myositis may be different from those associated with Caucasian patients.

TI  - Association of asthma and the interleukin-4 promoter gene in Japanese.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases is known to be associated with genetic components. Several investigator have linked the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and nearby markers located on chromosome 5 to atopy and asthma. Recent study has demonstrated that the T allele of a polymorphism in the IL-4 gene promoter region (C-590T) is associated with elevated levels of total serum IgE. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible role of this IL-4 polymorphism (C-590T) in modulating the allergic response and asthma in Japanese children. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in two different populations: families ascertained through asthmatic children (asthmatic group, 306 members) in whom linkage of asthma and atopy to chromosome 5q31-33 is suggested and a random general population (control group, 215 members). The IL-4 C-590T polymorphism was genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Frequency of the T allele was 0.73 in the asthmatic group and 0.70 in the control group. No significant difference in the levels of total serum IgE and specific IgE to house dust mite was observed between subjects with homozygote for the C allele, a heterozygote and a homozygote for the T allele by intrafamilial and interfamilial comparisons. Using the transmission disequilibrium test, however, we found a significantly frequent transmission of the T allele to asthmatic children (chi2=5.72, P=0.023). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the IL-4 promoter C-590T polymorphism may be associated with the development of asthma in Japanese children, but not through modulating total serum IgE levels.

Oral administration of SST also augmented IL-2 receptor beta chain+ (activated) T-cell in Peyer's patch lymphocyte, but not in the nasal lymphocyte. We previously reported that SST showed potent anti-influenza virus activity through augmentation of the antiviral IgA antibody titer in the nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities of the mice (T. Nagai and H. Yamada, 1994, Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 16, 605-613). These results suggest that oral administration of SST shows anti-influenza virus activity in the nasal cavity by activation of T-cell in Peyer's patch lymphocyte and stimulation of production of anti-influenza virus IgA antibody in nasal lymphocyte. When ovalbumin-sensitized allergic pulmonary inflammation model mice were administered orally with SST (1 g/kg) from 8 days before (11 times) or from 2 h after (4 times) to 4 days after the infection and infected with mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34, replications of the virus in the both nasal and broncho-alveolar cavities or only nasal cavity were significantly inhibited at 5 days after infection in comparison with water-treated control by augmenting antiviral IgA antibody, respectively. These results suggest that SST is useful for both prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infection on patients with allergic pulmonary inflammation, such as bronchial asthma.

TI  - Liver transferase activity in healthy Japanese employees aged 18-39 years.  
AB  - The aims of the present study were to identify correlates of alanine aminotransferase (ALT or GPT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST or GOT) activities among a healthy working population aged 18-39, and to discuss liver transferase abnormalities. Subjects included 1,009 employees of a company in Fukushima, Japan. Pregnant women, employees exposed to organic solvents, and employees with a history of liver diseases were excluded. Serum ALT and AST levels were measured by an enzymatic method. Other information including BMI, job type and lifestyles was recorded. Mean ALT and AST levels were significantly higher for males than females (P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that sex and BMI explained 45% and 31% of the variability in ALT and AST, respectively. The prevalence of abnormal ALT levels (> 40 IU) was 16.3% for males and 0.4% for females. Sex, BMI, and shift work were independently associated with abnormal ALT levels by logistic regression analysis. It is concluded that ALT and AST levels are well-correlated with sex and BMI, and that abnormal liver transferase activity is prevalent in male employees but rare in females, suggesting that liver function tests should be introduced for male employees under 40 years of age.

TI  - Mitral valve aneurysm as a sequela of infective endocarditis: review of pathologic findings in Japanese cases.  
AB  - Mitral valve aneurysm is defined as a localized protrusion of the valve with a different radius from that of the remaining portion of the valve. The medical records and pathological findings of seven patients with mitral valve aneurysm [aged 48-69 years (mean 64), 4 males] and the pathological findings of other 29 Japanese cases were reviewed. All seven patients were diagnosed pathologically as infective endocarditis, but two patients had no documentation of clinical symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis (latent infective endocarditis). The underlying lesion of the heart was aortic valve disease and/or fibrosal degeneration of the mitral valve. Only 29 of 36 Japanese case reports stated a precise description of the valve pathology. Of these 29 cases, 23 were associated with infective endocarditis, two with rheumatic valvular disease with fusion and/or shrinkage of the chordae tendineae, three with mitral valve prolapse or myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, and one with aortitis syndrome. Neovascularization was described in eight cases. Neovascularization with thick wall should be considered as post-inflammatory vascularization. This review indicates that patients with latent infective endocarditis and mitral valve aneurysm should be considered as potential candidates for valve surgery.

TI  - Micro and macro perspectives in auxology: findings and considerations upon the variability of short term and individual growth and the stability of population derived parameters.  
AB  - The present paper links the two most contrasting aspects of auxology, and addresses the apparent discrepancy between the variability and pulsatility of short term individual growth, and the stability of population derived parameters. When body stature is measured at monthly intervals, an irregular incremental pattern becomes obvious, with a number of large scale components such as series of prepubertal and pubertal growth spurts, seasonal influences on height gain, and influences of the psychosocial and economic background. When measurement intervals decrease, the patterns of stature increment appear even more irregular, and a number of short scale components become apparent, that are distinct from measurement error. Observations are presented that suggest growth being a pulsatile, a periodic, a saltatory, respectively a chaotic event as suggested by some recent studies in animals and in human newborns. Accurate measurements of the lower leg at intervals of 24 hours support the idea of short term growth being characterized by chaotic series of 'mini growth spurts' that occur at intervals of approximately 4-9 days. The amplitude of mini growth spurts ranges between 2 and some 10 mm, and also growth velocity of each spurt varies considerably so that one spurt needs between less than one and up to several days for completion. The very opposite of the variability of individual growth was found in populations. A meta-analysis of 40 male and 51 female European and US American growth studies revealed an almost uniform general pattern of average stature increment during the last 100 years. An additional analysis of stature variation of very large Japanese and Czechoslovakian growth surveys, with all together more than 23000000 measurements, and more than 500000 German preschool and school measurements, suggested similar uniformity in the standard deviation of stature.

TI  - Production of emotional facial expressions in European American, Japanese, and Chinese infants.  
AB  - European American, Japanese, and Chinese 11-month-olds participated in emotion-inducing laboratory procedures. Facial responses were scored with BabyFACS, an anatomically based coding system. Overall, Chinese infants were less expressive than European American and Japanese infants. On measures of smiling and crying, Chinese infants scored lower than European American infants, whereas Japanese infants were similar to the European American infants or fell between the two other groups. Results suggest that differences in expressivity between European American and Chinese infants are more robust than those between European American and Japanese infants and that Chinese and Japanese infants can differ significantly. Cross-cultural differences were also found for some specific brow, cheek, and midface facial actions (e.g., brows lowered). These are discussed in terms of current controversies about infant affective facial expressions.

TI  - Microsatellite polymorphism within the MICB gene among Japanese patients with Behcet's disease.  
AB  - Behcet's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B51. In order to investigate the influence of the MICB gene, located about 120 kb centromeric of the HLA-B gene, on the susceptibility to BD, (CA/TG) dinucleotide repeat microsatellite polymorphism in intron 1 of the MICB gene was investigated among 77 Japanese patients with BD, 60 randomly selected controls and 28 HLA-B51-positive unrelated healthy controls. There was no significant difference in the phenotype frequency of the microsatellite polymorphism between the BD patients and controls. This result suggests that the MICB gene itself is not responsible for the development of BD, and that the candidate gene(s) for BD is located between the MICA and HLA-C genes.

TI  - Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac valvular abnormalities in adults with Down's syndrome.  
AB  - It is well known that congenital heart abnormalities are common in children with Down's syndrome. However there are few studies on cardiac abnormalities in adults with Down's syndrome. Therefore, we estimated cardiac abnormalities by means of echocardiography in 30 institutionalized Japanese adults with Down's syndrome, but without cardiac symptoms. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed an incidence of 26.7% in mitral valve prolapse and 20% increase of echo brightness in the mitral valve. Doppler echocardiography revealed an incidence of 16.7% in mitral valve regurgitation, and 13.3% in aortic valve regurgitation. Thus, even adults with Down's syndrome who are apparently free of cardiac symptoms may be at risk for valvular disease.

TI  - Analysis of peripherin/RDS gene for Japanese retinal dystrophies.  
AB  - We studied 133 Japanese patients with retinal dystrophies to detect peripherin/RDS (retinal degeneration slow) gene defects. The patients analyzed included 52 with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, 36 with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, 3 with simplex retinitis pigmentosa, 12 with cone-rod dystrophy, 5 with rod-cone dystrophy, 3 with vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best's disease), 4 with macular dystrophy, 2 with cone dystrophy, 2 with fundus flavimaculatus, 2 with fundus albipunctatus, and 12 with retinitis pigmentosa with macular degeneration as well as 40 unrelated normal persons. Three exons of the peripherin/RDS gene cut into 150-200 base-pair fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism. The DNA fragments with any suspected variations were directly sequenced. Eight point mutations were detected. Among them, two missense mutations at codons 304 and 338 result in an amino acid substitution of glutamine for glutamic acid and aspartic acid for glycine, respectively. However, they were not cosegregated with the diseases, and these mutations were also commonly found in normal controls. For these controls, the proportion of transversion from G to C at codon 304 (GAG-->CAG) and transition from G to A at codon 338 (GGC-->GAC) were 0.192 +/- 0.045 and 0.173 +/- 0.053, respectively. Our results suggest that a peripherin/RDS gene mutation might be rare in Japanese patients.

TI  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast in male: case report and review of the Japanese literature.  
AB  - We report a case of intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast in a 62-year-old Japanese man, who came to our hospital complaining of a right subareolar mass. Imaging diagnosis was a cyst with an intracystic component. Since repeated aspiration biopsy cytology was interpreted as a borderline lesion, no additional treatment had been given. Because he wanted the removal of the mass 14 months after his first visit, an excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. Pathological examination revealed the intracystic component to be non-invasive papillary carcinoma. Although the incidence of male breast cancer is approximately 1% of all breast cancer, intracystic papillary carcinoma in the male is very rare. From a review of the literature on this disease in Japanese men, an intracystic component can often be demonstrated by ultrasound. However, it is difficult to confirm malignant cells by aspiration biopsy cytology of cyst fluid. Since some cases have a local relapse, excisional biopsy and long-term follow-up are indicated.

TI  - Novel point mutation in the leucine-rich motif of the platelet glycoprotein IX associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.  
AB  - Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder which is caused by a qualitative or quantitative abnormality of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex. We examined a patient with BSS to find a molecular basis for the defect underlying this disease. The propositus was a 39-year-old Japanese female with life-long bleeding diathesis. Sequence analysis of the GPIX gene revealed a T-->C point mutation at nucleotide 1856 (EMBL, M80478), resulting in Phe55(TTT)-->Ser(TCT) replacement. This substitution created a new MnlI restriction site in the mutant allele. Restriction analysis revealed that the propositus was homozygous for this sequence, and the same mutation was not detected in 57 unrelated Japanese subjects. Since this mutation is located in the leucine-rich motif (LRM) of the GPIX polypeptide, the Phe55-->Ser substitution may result in an alteration of the LRM which leads to the impaired surface expression of GPIb/IX/V complex, a characteristic of BSS.

TI  - Present characteristics of symptomatic amebiasis due to Entamoeba histolytica in the east-southeast area of Tokyo.  
AB  - Admitted medical records, from January 1988 to December 1995, of 28 symptomatic amebic patients who lived in the east-southeast area of Tokyo were studied retrospectively, in order to find the present characteristics of symptomatic amebiasis due to Entamoeba histolytica in this area. Categorized by disease, there were 14 cases of colitis, 9 cases of liver abscess, 4 cases of colitis with liver abscess, and 1 case of liver abscess with brain abscess. Patients consisted of 26 Japanese males, 0 Japanese females, 1 non-Japanese male and 1 non-Japanese female. The mean age of colitis patients and liver abscess patients was 55.4 years old and 41.3 years old, respectively. The presumed place of contraction was Japan in 64% of the patients. Forty-eight percent of male patients indicated that they engaged in homosexual or bisexual practices, and 36% of male patients who denied such sexual practices or did not answer the question had no history of marriage. Positive rate of serum titre for Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test (TPHA) and human immunodeficiency virus antibody was 42.9% and 0%, respectively. Sixty-seven percent of TPHA-positive patients indicated that they engaged in male homosexual or bisexual practices. Zymodeme patterns of E. histolytica isolated from 4 colitis patients were XIV in 1 case and II in 3 cases. Symptomatic amebiasis in the east-southeast area of Tokyo is a disease which predominantly afflicts males, especially those in their middle age, and most patients contract the disease in Japan. The high rates of patients who engaged in male homosexual or bisexual practices and the high rates of patients with positive TPHA suggest that amebiasis is likely to be sexually transmitted disease in homosexual and bisexual men in the east-southeast area of Tokyo, and zymodeme II may be the predominant type in symptomatic amebic colitis in this area.

TI  - [Two cases of cystic fibrosis in Japanese/German twins]  
AB  - We report a case of twins with cystic fibrosis. The twins are of mixed parentage, having a Japanese mother and a German father. One case presented with meconium ileus as a neonate. The other twin was relatively healthy until the age of 6, when she was first hospitalized with a diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. They have been receiving standard therapies in the United States, including digestive enzymes, vitamins, and periodic antibiotics. At the age of 19 both patients received home intravenous antibiotic therapy, and began to use an inhaled DNase at the age of 20. When the patients were 19 they were screened for the common mutations causing cystic fibrosis, and the delta F508 CFTR mutation was identified. We analyzed their CFTR genes, as well as those of their Japanese mother and grandmother. Missense mutations at exon 7 (R347H) and exon 16 were found (D979A) in the twins and in their Japanese mother.
