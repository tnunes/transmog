TI  - Highly sensitive and specific detection of P-glycoprotein function for haematological and solid tumour cells using a novel nucleic acid stain.  
AB  - Progress in our understanding of the contribution of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated resistance to chemotherapy failure in haematological as well as solid tumours has been hampered by the lack of highly sensitive, reliable methods for the detection of P-gp function in fresh human tumour cells. The present study identifies the novel nucleic acid stain SYTO16 as a highly sensitive and specific dye to assess P-gp function. The effect of P-gp is expressed here as the ratio of dye fluorescence (RF) from cells incubated with dye with or without 2 microM of the P-gp inhibitor PSC 833. Using flow cytometric analysis, an RF of 0.9 was found for SYTO16 in the KB3-1 (P-gp-) and 1.6 in KB8 (P-gp+) cells. Three types of patients' cells were studied: (1) in haematopoietic CD34+ cells, which are known to express P-gp, the RF was 6.0 for SYTO16 compared with 2.5 for rhodamine 123 and 1.3 for daunorubicin (mean of five individuals); (2) in acute myeloid leukaemia cells, the RF for SYTO16 was 1.0 in P-gp- and 4.5 in P-gp+ samples; (3) for the first time, we have quantitated P-gp function in fresh human solid tumour (sarcoma) cells. We found, in a P-gp+ leiomyosarcoma, an RF of 16 for SYTO16 and 2.7 for daunorubicin. This means that complete inhibition of P-gp function in these sarcoma cells would lead to an increase of daunorubicin accumulation with 170% compared with 30% in the CD34+ cells. Next, we showed that SYTO16 could be fixed in nuclei by 3.6% formaldehyde treatment, allowing quantification of the nuclear fluorescence on cytospins by laser scanning microscopy. In conclusion, SYTO16 proved to have a combination of favourable properties: it can be excited at 488 nm and has large fluorescence enhancement upon binding to nucleic acids, allowing the use of low, nontoxic (< 10 nM) concentrations. Because the RF for SYTO16 is much higher than for daunorubicin, it can be applied for the determination of P-gp function in relatively small numbers of low-P-gp-expressing tumour cells by laser scanning microscopy. Individual sarcomas were found to have high P-gp function compared with CD34+ cells. This assay may be used to select patients for P-gp modulation protocols.

TI  - Artefactual cleavage of E coli H-NS by OmpT.  
AB  - In the bacterium Escherichia coli, H-NS-(H1, H1a) is a heat-stable protein with a molecular mass of 15.5 kDa involved in nucleoid organisation and gene regulation linked to certain signal transduction pathways. We have shown that, following addition of preparations of everted inner membrane vesicles, heat-stable cleavage products of approximately 10 kDa of H-NS are formed in vitro from newly synthesised, radio-labelled H-NS and from purified H-NS. The 15.5 kDa protein and its cleavage products were also recovered from a minicell system. These results raised the possibility that cleavage of H-NS is physiologically significant. However, the cleavage of H-NS observed appears to occur during cell breakage and to depend on the method of protein extraction and the presence of the outer membrane protease, OmpT. Nevertheless, the results indicate that H-NS may contain at least two separate domains with cleavage occurring between these domains at a preferred OmpT site. Failure to take account of H-NS cleavage in sample preparation and analysis can lead to serious underestimation of H-NS levels.

TI  - [Trace elements in biological samples and immunologic parameters in environmentally exposed populations (preliminary study)]  
AB  - In non-smoking policemen from a town of Central Italy, blood CD4+ lymphocytes were reduced and CD8+ were increased as compared with a control group. This immunological alteration was not evident in the smoking policemen. Urine lead (marker of exposure to toxic agents produced by traffic) and blood natural killer (NK) CD16+ lymphocytes as well as serum copper and HLA-DR+ cells (B, T, NK activated lymphocytes and monocytes) were significantly correlated in the whole group of 42 examined subjects. Another study was performed on 15 healthy men, occupationally not exposed to toxic agents and living in a suburban area.  Their urine lead, was positively correlated with the serum IgA immunoglobulins and negatively correlated with blood CD5(+)-CD19+ (a B subset bearing the T CD5 antigen) lymphocytes. On the contrary, urine chromium was negatively correlated with serum IgA and positively correlated with CD16(+)-56+ NK and CD5(+)-CD19+ B lymphocytes as well as with HLA-DR+cells. Serum zinc was also correlated with total HLA-DR+and CD3-HLA+DR+ (activated B and NK lymphocytes and monocytes) cells. These later data suggest that only zinc and copper but also trivalent chromium (to which normal population is mainly exposed in ordinary environmental conditions) may play a role in the mechanisms regulating the immune response.

TI  - Pathways of lead exposure in urban children.  
AB  - A linear structural equation modeling procedure was used to explore the mechanisms and pathways for lead intake among urban children and the relative contribution of various lead sources to lead-contaminated house dust. Dust lead levels were significantly associated with children's blood lead levels, both indirectly and directly via hand lead. Both soil and paint lead contributed to dust lead levels, but paint contributed significantly more lead to house dust than soil (P < 0.001). Black race and income level both directly affected children's blood lead levels. Finally, time spent outdoors was associated with children putting soil or dirt in their mouths which was, in turn, associated with children's blood lead levels. These data indicate that mouthing behaviors are an important mechanism of exposure among urban children with low-level elevations in blood lead and that lead-based paint is a more important contributor of lead to house dust than is lead-contaminated soil.

AB  - Since several workers engaged in polishing and engraving crystal articles were found to have higher than average blood levels of lead (560 micrograms/liter, range 80-560 micrograms/liter), we investigated the hypothesis that crystal dust releases lead in the human body. To test the hypothesis, two types of crystal polishing dusts, having different lead contents, were mixed with human serum diluted 1:3 (pseudointerstitial fluid), gastric juice, and phosphate buffer at pH 9. After 14 days of contact, the diluted serum had extracted 0.620% of the lead in the crystal dust (particle size < 20 microns) containing 25.2% lead and 0.425% of that containing 19.9% lead. After 48 hr in gastric juice, 0.235 and 0.556% of the lead was extracted from crystal dusts (unsieved crystal dusts) containing 25.2 and 19.9% lead, respectively. After 28 days in alkaline solution, 0.358 and 0.304% of the lead was extracted respectively from the same two crystal dusts (unsieved crystal dusts).

TI  - Effective size and F-statistics of subdivided populations. I. Monoecious species with partial selfing.  
AB  - Assuming discrete generations and autosomal inheritance involving genes that do not affect viability or reproductive ability, we have derived recurrence equations for the inbreeding coefficient and coancestry between individuals within and among subpopulations for a subdivided monoecious population with arbitrary distributions of male and female gametes per family, variable pollen and seed migration rates, and partial selfing. From the equations, formulas for effective size and expressions for F-statistics are obtained. For the special case of a single unsubdivided population, our equations reduce to the simple expressions derived by previous authors. It is shown that population structure (subdivision and migration) is important in determining the inbreeding coefficient and effective size. Failure to recognize internal structures of populations may lead to considerable bias in predicting effective size. Inbreeding coefficient, coancestry between individuals within and among subpopulations accrue at different and variable rates over initial generations before they converge to the same asymptotic rate of increase. For a given population, the smaller the pollen and seed migration rates, the more generations are required to attain the asymptotic rate and the larger the asymptotic effective size. The equations presented herein can be used for the study of evolutionary biology and conservation genetics.

TI  - [The influence of culinary processing on content of lead and cadmium in carrots]  
AB  - The research was performed to determine both safety of carrot dishes consumption taking into account lead and cadmium intake and prospect of lowering content of these elements in carrot during culinary processing. Different but unspecified varieties of investigated carrot came from the Warsaw market and from allotments and fields in Upper Silesia. Lead and cadmium level was determined in raw material as well as the elements' distribution in different parts of carrot root. The impact of initial treatment including peeling and soaking in water of the crumbled vegetable was studied. The carrot was cooked traditionally beginning with boiling or cold water. Lead and cadmium content were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry for extracts of APDC complexes. The investigated raw material contained little lead (an average 0.019 mg/kg) and cadmium (average 0.015 mg/kg). Both elements are distributed in layers in entire carrot root. The highest concentration of both lead and cadmium can be found in the skin (0.075 mg Pb and 0.0115 mg Cd/kg skin), lower in parenchyma (0.028 mg Pb and 0.066 mg Cd/kg parenchyma) and the lowest in the core (0.027 mg Pb and Cd/kg core). Because of unequal concentration of both elements in each layer, peeling eliminates up to 25% lead and about 19% cadmium. Keeping carrot in water showed a tendency to diminish the level of both elements in raw material. Soaking carrot for 24 h made it shed 40% of lead and 67% of cadmium. Cooking process decreased both metal's concentration in the vegetable. The traditional cooking method diminished lead content by 6-47% and cadmium content by 35-44%.

TI  -  Lead exchange in teeth and bone--a pilot study using stable lead isotopes.  
AB  - Stable lead isotopes and lead concentrations were measured in the enamel and dentine of permanent (n = 37) and deciduous teeth (n = 14) from 47 European immigrants to Australia to determine whether lead exchange occurs in teeth and how it relates to lead exchange in bone. Enamel exhibits no exchange of its European-origin lead with lead from the Australian environment. In contrast, dentine lead exchanges with Australian lead to the extent of approximately 1% per year. In one subject, trabecular bone from the tooth socket exchanged almost all its European lead with Australian lead over a a 15-year period (turnover of approximately 6% per year), similar to the approximately 8% per year proposed for lead turnover in trabecular bone. The repository characteristics of intact circumpulpal dentine were investigated by analyses of four sets of contiguous slices from six teeth: 1) a set consisting of slices with intact circumpulpal dentine and cementum; 2) a set in which these areas were removed; 3) another set consisting of slices with intact circumpulpal dentine and cementum; and 4) a set without cementum. These analyses show relatively small differences in isotopic composition between contiguous slices except that circumpulpal dentine appears to be the dominant control on lead concentration. There is a significant correlation (R2 = 0.19, p = 0.01, n = 34) of dentine lead concentration and rate of exchange with residence time from the country of origin and Australian lead, but there is no such correlation with enamel lead concentration. Analyses of permanent and deciduous teeth of subjects from other countries who have resided in Australia for varying lengths of time should resolve some of the questions arising from this pilot study.

AB  - In several G-protein-coupled signaling systems, ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation by specific kinases is suggested to lead to desensitization via mechanisms including receptor/G-protein uncoupling, receptor internalization, and receptor down-regulation. We report here that elimination of phosphorylation of a chemoattractant receptor of Dictyostelium, either by site-directed substitution of the serines or by truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, completely prevented agonist-induced loss of ligand binding but did not impair the adaptation of several receptor-mediated responses including the activation of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases and actin polymerization. In addition, the phosphorylation-deficient receptors were capable of mediating chemotaxis, aggregation, and differentiation. We propose that for chemoattractant receptors agonist-induced phosphorylation regulates surface binding activity but other phosphorylation-independent mechanisms mediate response adaptation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of scatter and x-ray field gradient on entrance skin exposure and mean glandular dose by using the measurement protocol of the American College of Radiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The exposure difference between the off-axis geometry of the American College of Radiology protocol and the central-axis geometry was measured by using eight common ionization chambers and two mammographic units (Senographe DMR; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis; and Mam-CP II; Transcontinental X-ray, Charlotte, NC) at 25, 28, and 30 kVp. The field gradient was also measured on film with a scanning densitometer. RESULTS: The central-axis exposure was 2.0%-3.6% higher than the off-axis exposure for the Senographe DMR unit and 3.1%-8.0% higher for the Mam-CP II unit. The maximum phantom scatter was 0.7% (Senographe DMR) and 1.3% (Mam-CP II). CONCLUSION: Entrance skin exposure varies, depending on the type of ionization chamber and the characteristics of the mammographic unit. Determination of mean glandular dose with the American College of Radiology protocol may lead to underestimates of the actual measured dose by 4%-8% for the x-ray machines used in this study.

TI  - Lead system optimization for transvenous defibrillation.  
AB  - Lead systems that include an active pectoral shell reduce defibrillation thresholds and permit transvenous defibrillation in nearly all patients. A further improvement in defibrillation efficacy is desirable to allow for smaller pulse generators with a reduced maximum output. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare defibrillation thresholds with multiple transvenous lead systems including those with an active pectoral shell to determine which system would optimize defibrillation energy requirements. This prospective study was performed on 21 consecutive patients. Each subject was evaluated with 3 lead configurations with the order of testing randomized. The configurations were a dual coil transvenous lead (lead), the distal right ventricular coil and pectoral pulse generator shell (unipolar), and all 3 components (triad). The right ventricular coil was the cathode for the first phase of the biphasic defibrillation waveform. Delivered energy at defibrillation threshold was 11.2 +/- 3.4 J for the lead configuration, 10.1 +/- 5.2 J for the unipolar configuration, and 7.8 +/- 3.6 J for the triad configuration (p <0.01). Leading edge voltage (p <0.01) and shock impedance (p <0.001) were also decreased for the triad configuration compared with the lead or unipolar configurations, whereas peak current was minimized with the unipolar configuration (p <0.01). We conclude that the combination of a dual coil, transvenous lead and an active pectoral shell reduces defibrillation energy requirements compared with either the lead alone or unipolar configuration. Moreover, the defibrillation thresholds were < or =15 J in all patients using the triad lead system.

TI  - Mutation detection in the repeated part of the PKD1 gene.  
AB  - The principle cause of one of the most prevalent genetic disorders, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, involves mutations in the PKD1 gene. However, since its identification in 1994, only 27 mutations have been published. Detection of mutations has been complicated because the greater part of the gene lies within a genomic region that is reiterated several times at another locus on chromosome 16. Amplification of DNA fragments in the repeated part of the PKD1 gene will lead to coamplification of highly homologous fragments derived from this other locus. These additional fragments severely hamper point-mutation detection. None of the point mutations published to date are located in the repeated part of the PKD1 gene. However, we have reduced the problems posed by the strong homology, by using the protein-truncation test, and we have identified eight novel mutations, seven of which are located in the repeated part of the PKD1 gene.

In order to establish safe guidelines, a three-stage process was used. First, psychophysical data was used to generate the models' discounting factors and recommended load capacities. Second, biomechanical analysis was used to refine the recommended load capacities. Third, physiological criteria were used to validate the models' discounting factors. Both task and personal factors were considered in the models' development. When compared to the results from prior psychophysical research for these activities, the developed load capacity values are lower than previously established limits. The results of this study allowed the authors to validate the hypothesis proposed and tested by Karwowski (1983) that states that the combination of physiological and biomechanical stresses should lead to the overall measure of task acceptability or the psychophysical stress. This study also found that some of the discounting factors for the task frequency parameters recommended in the prior psychophysical research should not be used as several of the high frequency factors violated physiological limits.

TI  - Double-strand break repair by Ku70 requires heterodimerization with Ku80 and DNA binding functions.  
AB  - Heterodimers of the 70 and 80 kDa Ku autoantigens (Ku70 and Ku80) activate the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Mutations in any of the three subunits of this protein kinase (Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs) lead to sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and to DNA double-strand breaks, and V(D)J recombination product formation defects. Here we show that the IR repair, DNA end binding and DNA-PK defects in Ku70-/- embryonic stem cells can be counteracted by introducing epitope-tagged wild-type Ku70 cDNA. Truncations and chimeras of Ku70 were used to identify the regions necessary for DNA end binding and IR repair. Site-specific mutational analysis revealed a core region of Ku70 responsible for DNA end binding and heterodimerization. The propensity for Ku70 to associate with Ku80 and to bind DNA correlates with the ability to activate DNA-PK, although two mutants showed that the roles of Ku70 in DNA-PK activation and IR repair are separate. Mutation of DNA-PK autophosphorylation sites and other structural motifs in Ku70 showed that these sites are not necessary for IR repair in vivo. These studies reveal Ku70 features required for double-strand break repair.

TI  - [Renal complications in HIV-1 infection]  
AB  - Renal involvement in AIDS may be specific or unspecific. Unspecific lesions, the most common, are usually an acute tubular necrosis produced by hemodynamic, infectious or electrolytic alterations that lead to an acute renal failure or drug nephrotoxicity. Specific lesions are segmental and focal hyalinosis, immune complex glomerulonephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy. Focal and segmental hyalinosis is observed almost exclusively in black people and produces a rapidly progressive renal failure. Lesions are a consequence of HIV stimulation of TGF beta in mesangial cells. Immune complex glomerulonephritis, formed by HIV antigens and anti HIV antibodies, is observed in white and black people. The glomerular lesion in this condition is less severe than in the former. Thrombotic microangiopathy could be a consequence of a pathogenic effect of the virus over glomerular capillaries and arterioles. It is clinically expressed as a hemolytic uremic syndrome. This paper reports briefly the renal pathological study of 46 patients infected with HIV-1, seen at the Nephrology Service of the Bichat Hospital in Paris.

TI  - The combined transvenous implantation of cardioverter defibrillators and permanent pacemakers.  
AB  - We developed criteria for implantation and programming of permanent endocardial pacemakers in patients with a nonthoracotomy ICD system. These criteria were prospectively used in 10 patients who recieved an ICD prior to (n = 5) or following (n = 5) implantation of a dual chamber (n = 6) or ventricular (n = 4) pacemaker with a unipolar (n = 4) or bipolar (n = 6) lead configuration. All patients were tested for interactions or malfunctions. Undersensing of ventricular fibrillation by the atrial sense amplifier and inadequate atrial pacing occurred in one patient with a unipolar dual chamber system programmed to AAIR but didn't impair ICD sensing. Transient or permanent loss of capture or sensing of the pacemaker was not observed after ICD shocks with the output programmed to double pulse width and voltage of stimulation threshold and the sensitivity to 50% of the detected R wave. One episode of transient reprogramming occurred without clinical consequences. One unipolar ventricular pacemaker lead had to be exchanged against a bipolar lead because of oversensing of the pacing artifact by the ICD. There was no failure of an ICD to detect ventricular arrhythmias due to inadequate pacemaker activity. During a follow-up period of 21 +/- 11 months, a total of 78 ventricular arrhythmias were effectively treated in six patients. Thus, a combined use of transvenous ICD and pacemaker is possible despite the close vicinity of pacing and defibrillations leads. Optimized programming different to the common settings is required. As interactions occurred only in unipolar pacemaker leads bipolar systems should be used in these patients.

TI  - Lead concentrations in human plasma, urine and whole blood.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blood-lead levels (B-Pb), and to some extent urinary lead (U-Pb), are the most employed measures of lead exposure and risk. However, the small fraction of lead present in plasma (usually below 1% of that in blood) is probably more relevant to lead exposure and toxicity. Nevertheless, the lead content of plasma lead (P-Pb) has only seldom been used, mainly due to analytical limitations, which have now been overcome. We examined P-Pb in occupationally exposed subjects, as well as its relationship with B-Pb and U-Pb. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 145 male workers, 110 of whom were employed in lead work. After a simple dilution of plasma, P-Pb was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The detection limit was 0.04 microg/l, and the imprecision was 5%. RESULTS: The lead concentration ranges were 0.20-37 microg/l for P-Pb, 0.9-176 microg/l (density adjusted) for U-Pb, and 9-930 microg/l for B-Pb. A close exponential relation was obtained between B-Pb and P-Pb. When B-Pb was plotted versus log P-Pb, a straight line (log P-Pb = 0.00225 x B-Pb - 0.58; r = 0.97) was obtained. Both the relation between U-Pb and P-Pb and that between U-Pb and B-Pb showed a large scattering (r = 0.78 in both cases). The relation to B-Pb appeared to be exponential, while that to P-Pb appeared to be linear. CONCLUSIONS: The low detection limit and good precision of P-Pb determinations make it possible to use P-Pb in assessments of lead exposure and risk. Furthermore, in relative terms, P-Pb is a more sensitive measure than B-Pb, especially at high lead levels. This development is of importance for studies of exposure, possibly also for studies of risks.

TI  - Complications following airway surgery in Noonan syndrome.  
AB  - Two children with Noonan syndrome underwent airway surgery and both experienced spontaneous chylothorax after surgery. The Noonan syndrome phenotype may include defects that significantly increase the risk of complications associated with surgery. Manifestations of Noonan syndrome may include congenital heart disease; coagulation factor deficiency; pterygium colli; and lymphangiomatosis of the pleura, lungs, and chest wall that can lead to life-threatening chylothorax. In this article, the 2 cases are presented and the relevant literature is reviewed to increase awareness of the potential problems that may be encountered in patients with Noonan syndrome. Recommendations are made regarding preoperative investigations and perioperative management to prevent complications.

TI  - Heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum. Role of positive charge in enzymatic activity.  
AB  - Heparinases are bacterial enzymes that are powerful tools to study the physiological roles of heparin-like complex polysaccharides. In addition, heparinases have significant therapeutic applications. We had proposed earlier that cysteine 135 and histidine 203 together form the catalytic domain in heparinase I. We had also identified a heparin binding domain in heparinase I containing two positively charged clusters HB-1 and HB-2 in a primary heparin binding site and other positively charged residues in the vicinity of cysteine 135. In this study, through systematic site-directed mutagenesis studies, we show that the alteration of the positive charge of the HB-1 region has a pronounced effect on heparinase I activity. More specifically, site-directed mutagenesis of K199A (contained in HB-1) results in a 15-fold reduction in catalytic activity, whereas a K198A mutation (also in HB-1) results in only a 2- to 3-fold reduction in heparinase I activity. A K132A mutation, in close proximity to cysteine 135, also resulted in reduced (8-fold) activity. Heparin affinity chromatography experiments indicated moderately lowered binding affinities for the K132A, K198A, and the K199A mutant enzymes. The above results, taken together with our previous observations, lead us to propose that the positively charged heparin binding domain provides the necessary microenvironment for the catalytic domain of heparinase I. The dominant effect of lysine 199 suggests an additional, more direct, role in catalysis for this residue.

TI  - Cross-spectral and temporal factors in the precedence effect: discrimination suppression of the lag sound in free-field.  
AB  - In an anechoic chamber, subjects were required to discriminate a 20 degrees azimuthal change in a lag sound's position in the presence of a lead sound coming from a different direction. Delay between lead and lag sounds was adaptively varied in several conditions to track discrimination suppression thresholds. In experiment 1, lead and lag stimuli were 5-ms, 1-octave, A-weighted noise bursts (65 dB), with lead and lag parametrically set to center frequencies of 0.5, 2.0, or 3.0 kHz. Discrimination suppression thresholds were higher when lead and lag center frequencies coincided (mean: 11.3 ms) than when they did not coincide (mean: 2.9 ms). These results support the "spectral overlap hypothesis" of Blauert and Divenyi [Acustica 66, 267-274 (1988)], but not the "localization strength hypothesis" later proposed by Divenyi [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 91, 1078-1084 (1992)]. Spectral overlap and localization strength appear to be two relatively independent factors governing discrimination suppression. It is proposed here that localization strength is weighted more when stimuli are presented via headphones and the only cue to lateral position is the interaural temporal difference, while spectral overlap is weighted more for free-field presented stimuli. In experiment 2, lead and lag stimuli were 8-ms, 1.5-kHz A-weighted tone bursts (65 dB), with lead and lag rise times parametrically set to 0, 2, or 4 ms. In this case the amount of discrimination suppression increased as lead rise time became more abrupt or as lag rise time became more gradual. These results support the localization strength hypothesis: The greater the localization strength of the lead stimulus (independently assessed by measuring its minimum audible angle in isolation), the greater suppression it exerted on discriminability of the lag sound's position. It appears that for stimuli presented in the free-field, spectral overlap is the primary factor affecting discrimination suppression, but when overlap is held constant, abruptness of stimulus onsets governs the amount of suppression.

TI  - Analysis of primate IBN spike trains using system identification techniques. I. Relationship To eye movement dynamics during head-fixed saccades.  
AB  - The dynamic behavior of primate (Macaca fascicularis) inhibitory burst neurons (IBNs) during head-fixed saccades was analyzed by using system identification techniques. Neurons were categorized as IBNs on the basis of their anatomic location as well as by their activity during horizontal head-fixed saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements and vestibular nystagmus. Each IBN's latency or "dynamic lead time" (td) was determined by shifting the unit discharge in time until an optimal fit to the firing rate frequency B(t) profile was obtained by using the simple model based on eye movement dynamics,B(t) = r + b1(t); where is eye velocity. For the population of IBNs, the dynamic estimate of lead time provided a significantly lower value than a method that used the onset of the first spike. We then compared the relative abilities of different eye movement-based models to predict B(t) by using objective optimization algorithms. The most important terms for predicting B(t) were eye velocity gain (b1) and bias terms (r) mentioned above. The contributions of higher-order velocity, acceleration, and/or eye position terms to model fits were found to be negligible. The addition of a pole term [the time derivative of B(t)] in conjunction with an acceleration term significantly improved model fits to IBN spike trains, particularly when the firing rates at the beginning of each saccade [initial conditions (ICs)] were estimated as parameters. Such a model fit the data well (a fit comparable to a linear regression analysis with a R2 value of 0.5, or equivalently, a correlation coefficient of 0.74). A simplified version of this model [B(t) = rk + b1(t)], which did not contain a pole term, but in which the bias term (rk) was estimated separately for each saccade, provided nearly equivalent fits of the data. However, models in which ICs or rks were estimated separately for each saccade contained too many parameters to be considered as useful models of IBN discharges. We discovered that estimated ICs and rks were correlated with saccade amplitude for the majority of short-lead IBNs (SLIBNs; 56%) and many long-lead IBNs (LLIBNs; 42%). This observation led us to construct a more simple model that included a term that was inversely related to the amplitude of the saccade, in addition to eye velocity and constant bias terms. Such a model better described neuron discharges than more complex models based on a third-order nonlinear function of eye velocity. Given the small number of parameters required by this model (only 3) and its ability to fit the data, we suggest that it provides the most valuable description of IBN discharges. This model emphasizes that the IBN discharges are dependent on saccade amplitude and implies further that a mechanism must exist, at the motoneuron (MN) level, to offset the effect of the bias and amplitude-dependent terms. In addition, we did not find a significant difference in the variance accounted for by any of the downstream models tested for SLIBNs versus LLIBNs. Therefore we conclude that the eye movement signals encoded dynamically by SLIBNs and LLIBNs are similar in nature. Put another way, SLIBNs are not closer, dynamically, to MNs than LLIBNs.

TI  - Altered nitric oxide metabolism and increased oxygen free radical activity in lead-induced hypertension: effect of lazaroid therapy.  
AB  - Chronic exposure to low levels of lead results in sustained hypertension (HTN) in humans and experimental animals. The mechanism of lead-induced HTN remains unclear. We investigated the possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their impact on nitric oxide (NO) metabolism in lead-induced HTN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with lead (100 ppm in drinking water) for twelve weeks. They were then treated with either the potent antioxidant, lazaroid (des-methyl-tirilazad, 5 mg/kg i.p., twice daily) (Pb-Lz group) or placebo (Pb group) for two weeks and monitored for an additional two weeks. A group of normal animals served as controls (N = 6 in each group). Lead administration resulted in marked HTN together with a significant rise in plasma concentration of lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA, reflecting increased ROS generation) and a twofold reduction in urinary excretion of NO metabolites, that is, total nitrates and nitrites (NOx). Lazaroid therapy led to prompt normalization of blood pressure, plasma MDA and urinary NOx. In contrast, blood pressure and plasma MDA remained elevated, and recovery of urinary NOx excretion was slow with placebo therapy. No significant difference was found in creatinine clearance between the study groups during the observation period. Thus, chronic lead exposure resulted in marked HTN coupled with increased ROS production and decreased urinary NOx excretion. Administration of the potent antioxidant, lazaroid, abrogated HTN and reversed the abnormalities of plasma MDA and urinary NOx excretion, thus supporting the role of ROS in lead-induced HTN in this model.

TI  - Comparison of methods for personal sampling of inhalable and total lead and cadmium-containing aerosols in a primary lead smelter.  
AB  - It has been proposed that future occupational aerosol exposure standards be based on particle size-selective sampling criteria that more accurately reflect worker exposure. In relation to methods currently used for determining individual workers' lead exposures, the widely used 37-mm, closed-face, plastic sampling cassette is known from laboratory wind tunnel studies to undersample significantly compared with estimations of aerosol actually inhaled, especially for large particles. The present study investigated the degree to which this is borne out in field sampling by using side-by-side sampling in selected work sites in a primary lead smelter. Exposures to "total" airborne lead and cadmium as measured using the 37-mm sampler (E37) were compared with exposure measurements using the institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) personal inhalable aerosol sampler (EIOM). There were 166 good sample pairs for lead and 55 for cadmium. The ratio (reflecting the fractional undersampling of the 37-mm sampler, as represented by the ratio EIOM/E37) was consistently greater than unity, by factors obtained by regression analysis ranging (for different parts of the plant) from 1.39 to 2.14 for lead and 1.29 to 2.12 for cadmium. The factor tended to be greater for parts of the plant characterized by coarser aerosol, consistent with the physical sampling characteristics of the two instruments. This research is important (1) in assessing the impact of implementation of new standards for lead- and cadmium-containing aerosols in the primary lead production industry, and (2) in the development of new occupational exposure limits based on the inhalable aerosol fraction.

TI  - Overexpression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae magnesium transport system confers resistance to aluminum ion.  
AB  - Ionic aluminum (Al3+) is toxic to plants, microbes, fish, and animals, but the mechanism of its toxicity is unknown. We describe the isolation of two yeast genes (ALR1 and ALR2) which confer increased tolerance to Al3+ and Ga3+ ions when overexpressed while increasing strain sensitivity to Zn2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, and La3+ ions. The Alr proteins are homologous to the Salmonella typhimurium CorA protein, a bacterial Mg2+ and Co2+ transport system located in the periplasmic membrane. Yeast strains lacking ALR gene activity required additional Mg2+ for growth, and expression of either ALR1 or ALR2 corrected the Mg(2+)-requiring phenotype. The results suggest that the ALR genes encode the yeast uptake system for Mg2+ and other divalent cations. This hypothesis was supported by evidence that 57Co2+ accumulation was elevated in ALR-overexpressing strains and reduced in strains lacking ALR expression. ALR overexpression also overcame the inhibition of Co2+ uptake by Al3+ ions. The results indicate that aluminum toxicity to yeast occurs as a consequence of reduced Mg2+ influx via the Alr proteins. The molecular identification of the yeast Mg2+ transport system should lead to a better understanding of the regulation of Mg2+ homeostasis in eukaryote cells.

TI  - Second generation "peptoid" CCK-B receptor antagonists: identification and development of N-(adamantyloxycarbonyl)-alpha-methyl-(R)-tryptophan derivative (CI-1015) with an improved pharmacokinetic profile.  
AB  - We have previously described the design and development of CI-988, a peptoid analogue of CCK-4 with excellent binding affinity and selectivity for the CCK-B receptor. Due to its anxiolytic profile in animal models of anxiety, this compound was developed as a clinical candidate. However, during its development, it was determined that CI-988 had low bioavailability in both rodent and nonrodent species. In the clinic, it was further established that CI-988 had poor bioavailability. Thus, there was a need to identify an analogue with an improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The poor bioavailability was attributed to poor absorption and efficient hepatic extraction. We envisaged that reducing the molecular weight of the parent compound (5, MW = 614) would lead to better absorption. Thus, we synthesized a series of analogues in which the key alpha-methyltryptophan and adamantyloxycarbonyl moieties, required for receptor binding, were kept intact and the C-terminus was extensively modified. This SAR study led to the identification of tricyclo[3.3.1.1(3,7)]dec-2-yl [1S-[1 alpha(S*)2 beta]-[2-[(2-hydroxycyclohexyl)amino]-1-(1H-indol-3- ylmethyl)-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl]carbamate (CI-1015, 31) with binding affinities of 3.0 and 2900 nM for the CCK-B and CCK-A receptors, respectively. The compound showed CCK-B antagonist profile in the rat ventromedial hypothalamus assay with a Ke of 34 nM. It also showed an anxiolytic like profile orally in a standard anxiety paradigm (X-maze) with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 0.1 microgram/kg. Although the compound is less water soluble than CI-988, oral bioavailability in rat was improved nearly 10 times relative to CI-988 when dosed in HP beta CD. The blood-brain permeability of CI-1015 (31) was also enhanced relative to CI-988 (5). On the basis of the overall improved pharmacokinetic profile as well as enhanced brain penetration, CI-1015 (31) was chosen as a development candidate.

TI  - NIP domain prevents N-type inactivation in voltage-gated potassium channels.  
AB  - Shaker-related voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels are assembled from ion-conducting K(v)alpha subunits, which are integral membrane proteins, and auxiliary K(v)beta subunits. This leads to the formation of highly diverse heteromultimeric Kv channels that mediate outward currents with a wide range of time courses for inactivation. Two principal inactivation mechanisms have been recognized: C-type inactivation correlated with carboxy-terminal K(v)alpha-subunit structures, and N-type inactivation conferred by 'ball' domains in the amino termini of certain K(v)alpha and K(v)beta subunits. Assembly of heteromultimers with one or more K(v)alpha- and/or K(v)beta ball domains appears to be an essential principle of the generation of A-type Kv channel diversity. Here we show that, unexpectedly, the presence of K(v)alpha- or K(v)beta-ball domains does not dominate the gating phenotype in heteromultimers containing Kv1.6alpha subunits. These heteromultimers mediate non-inactivating currents because of the dominant-negative activity of a new type of N-type inactivation-prevention (NIP) domain present in the Kv1.6 amino terminus. Mutations in the NIP domain lead to loss of function, and its transfer to another K(v)alpha subunit leads to gain of function. Our discovery of the NIP domain, which neutralizes the activity of K(v)alpha- and K(v)beta-inactivation gates, establishes a new determinant for the gating behaviour of heteromultimeric Kv channels.

TI  - Why perinatal mortality cannot be a proxy for maternal mortality.  
AB  - In recent years, the perinatal mortality rate (PNMR) has been proposed as a proxy measure of maternal mortality, because perinatal deaths are more frequent and potentially more easily measured. This report assesses evidence for an association between these two statistics. This study, based upon data from Matlab, Bangladesh, shows that the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and the PNMR do not vary together over time, and that the PNMR does not reliably indicate either the magnitude or the direction of change in the MMR from year to year. Statistical analysis shows that the correlation between the PNMR and the MMR is not significantly different from zero. An examination of the major causes of maternal and perinatal deaths indicates that the two measures cannot be expected to vary together. Almost half of perinatal deaths result from causes that do not pose a threat to the mother's life, and almost half of maternal deaths result from causes that do not lead to perinatal death. Monitoring of the PNMR can give an inaccurate picture of maternal mortality and should not be used as a proxy.

TI  - Dietary lead intakes for mother/child pairs and relevance to pharmacokinetic models.  
AB  - Blood and environmental samples, including a quarterly 6-day duplicate diet, for nine mother/child pairs from Eastern Europe have been monitored for 12 to >24 months with high precision stable lead isotope analysis to evaluate the changes that occur when the subjects moved from one environment (Eastern Europe) to another with different stable lead isotopes (Australia). The children were between 6 and 11 years of age and the mothers were between 29 and 37 years of age. These data were compared with an Australian control mother/child pair, aged 31 and 6 years, respectively. A rationale for undertaking this study of mother/child pairs was to evaluate if there were differences in the patterns and clearance rates of lead from blood in children compared with their mothers. Blood lead concentrations ranged from 2.1 to 3.9 microg/dl in the children and between 1.8 and 4.5 microg/dl in the mothers, but the mean of differences between each mother and her child did not differ significantly from zero. Duplicate diets contained from 2.4 to 31.8 microg Pb/kg diet; the mean+/- standard deviation was 5.5 +/- 2.1 microg Pb/kg and total daily dietary intakes ranged from 1.6 to 21.3 microg/day. Mean daily dietary intakes relative to body weight showed that the intake for children was approximately double that for the mothers (0.218 vs. 0. 113 microg Pb/kg body weight/day). The correlations between blood lead concentration and mean daily dietary intake either relative to body weight or total dietary intake did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). Estimation of the lead coming from skeletal (endogenous) sources relative to the contribution from environmental (exogenous) sources ranges from 8 to 70% for the mothers and 12 to 66% for the children. The difference between mothers and children is not statistically significant (p = 0.28). The children do not appear to achieve the Australian lead isotopic profile at a faster rate than their mothers. These data provide evidence that the absorption or uptake of lead from dietary sources is similar in adult females and children of the age in this study. In spite of lower bone lead and faster bone remodeling and recycling in children compared with adult females, we see no differences between the mothers and their children in overall contribution of tissue lead to blood lead. Results from this study suggest that fractional absorption of ingested lead by children 6-11 years of age is comparable with absorption patterns observed among adult females in the 29-37-year-old age range. Because pharmacokinetic models apply a 40-50% absorption even for 7-year-old children, further investigations on fractional absorption of ingested lead by young children are warranted.Further investigations are especially needed in younger children than those who were subjects in the current study, particularly children in the 1-3-year-old age range. In addition, the effect of nutritional status and patterns of food intake on children's lead absorption require investigation, particularly given the increased prevalence of marginal nutritional status among low-income populations that are at increased risk of elevated blood lead levels.

TI  - Development of the specific purpose Monte Carlo code CEARXRF for the design and use of in vivo X-ray fluorescence analysis systems for lead in bone.  
AB  - X-ray fluorescence (XRF) systems have been increasingly used for in vivo toxic trace-element analysis in the human body, such as lead in the tibia. Monte Carlo simulation can provide an efficient and flexible method for designing and using in vivo XRF systems. The Monte Carlo code CEARXRF has been developed specifically to simulate the complete pulse height spectrum of energy-dispersive XRF systems. This code is capable of tracking photons in a general geometry and modelling all of the physics of photon interactions in the energy range 1-150 keV for elements Z = 1-94, including primary and higher degree excitations of K and L XRF, the Doppler broadening of Compton-scattered photon energies, and the polarization effects in low-energy photon scatterings. The scattering background for minimum detectable concentration (MDC) analysis may be simulated more accurately by taking into account Doppler broadening in the distribution of the Compton-scattered photon energy due to electron-binding effects. The use of polarized excitation photons has been shown to be important in producing a low scattering background and good measurement sensitivity. The code has two very unique and important features: (1) complete composition and density correlated sampling that is extremely useful for studying measurement sensitivity to small changes in sample composition and density; and (2) Monte Carlo library spectra calculation for the determination of elemental amounts by the Monte Carlo-Library Least-Squares (MCLLS) method. The capability of CEARXRF to aid the design and optimization of in vivo XRF analysis has been verified by modelling hypothesized lead K and L XRF measurement systems.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of c-Myc protein expression in medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) and to identify mechanisms in addition to c-myc gene amplification that lead to increased protein expression. METHODS: We analyzed c-myc gene copy number, mRNA level and protein expression in a panel of MB/PNET cell lines. C-Myc protein levels were assessed in tumor specimens and cell lines using immunohistochemical staining with a c-Myc-specific monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Southern analysis confirmed c-myc gene amplification in the D425 MED cell line and re-arrangement of one allele in D283 MED, which was analyzed further and appeared to represent a small deletion 3' of exon 3. C-myc transcript levels were dramatically elevated in both lines. Using a c-myc probe, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed c-myc present in 3 tandem copies at 8q24 in D283 MED and multiple copies as double minutes in D425 MED. Immunohistochemistry showed c-Myc protein expression in 9 of 10 tumors and all cell lines, regardless of gene amplification status or level of mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: c-Myc protein expression is common in MB/PNET tumor specimens and cell lines. Elevated protein levels are observed in the absence of amplification, suggesting that multiple mechanisms of c-myc dysregulation may be involved in MB/PNET. These studies support a role for c-Myc in the development of this common childhood tumor.

TI  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: staging and prognostic factors.  
AB  - While both the Rai and Binet staging systems continue to provide the most useful tools for assessing prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), both fail to identify subsets of patients that may, or may not, benefit from therapy. While numerous factors have been identified that correlate with stage, few have proven to be independent predictors of disease progression, survival, or resistance to chemotherapy. Several factors, including beta2-microglobulin, soluble CD23, and lymphocyte doubling time show particular promise as independent prognostic factors. Their usefulness, however, will remain uncertain until they have been adequately evaluated in prospective, randomized studies. Future studies should focus on the characterization of relevant biologic and immunologic markers in order to direct appropriate treatment for different subsets of patients and to lead to improved outcome in CLL.

TI  - Neonatal hydrocephalus. Mechanisms and consequences.  
AB  - Although hydrocephalus is a multifactorial disorder, the processes responsible for neurologic impairment can be classified into primary and secondary mechanisms. Primary mechanisms include mechanical compression and stretching of brain parenchyma, ischemia and anoxia, cerebral edema, and blood brain barrier dysfunction.  These processes lead to secondary mechanisms, which include cytologic and cytoarchitectural alterations of neurons, reduced size and numbers of cerebral microvessels, axonal degeneration and demyelination, and so on. Shunting studies suggest that neuronal cell death may not play a major role until severe stages of hydrocephalus and that some impairments in connectivity can be reversed. Relatively early shunting may alleviate many of the pathologic features of hydrocephalus, but residual impairments in neurotransmitter levels and dependence on anaerobic respiration leave the treated hydrocephalic brain vulnerable to subsequent insults.

TI  - [Evaluation and occurrence of high-risk pollutants in animal feed factories]  
AB  - Concentrations of some hazardous pollutants were studied in dust deposit samples (n = 30) taken from the indoor equipment of two feed mixture plants (FMP) in Hodonin district in 1995 and 1996; the pollutants involved mercury, cadmium, lead, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), alpha and beta hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), lindane (gamma HCH), DDT sum, DDT isomers, polychlorinated biphenyls (Delor 103, Delor 106, PCB indicator congeners). The statistically significantly higher (P < 0.01) average concentration of mercury (0.028 mg/kg) was recorded in dust depositions (n = 15) in FMP K. in comparison with FMP R. Increased concentrations of cadmium (more than 0.5 mg/kg) were determined in dust depositions in FMP K. in 1 sample (0.582 mg/kg), of lead (more than 5.0 mg/kg) in 1 sample (7.540 mg/kg), of HCB (more than 0.01 mg/kg) in two samples (0.034 and 0.036 mg/kg), of beta HCH (more than 0.005 mg/kg) in 4 samples (0.021; 0.022; 0.023 and 0.046 mg/kg), higher DDT sum (more than 0.05 mg/kg) were determined in FMP K. in 3 samples (0.072; 0.085 and 0.190 mg/kg) and of PCB sum (more than 0.05 mg/kg) in 4 samples (0.054; 0.059; 0.074 and 1.085 mg/kg). In comparison with FMP K., dust depositions (n = 15) in FMP R. showed the statistically significantly higher (P < 0.05) average concentration of lead (5.241 mg/kg). Increased concentrations of lead were determined in dust depositions in FMP R. in 7 samples (5.040; 5.230; 6.760; 7.590; 7.620; 8.450 and 15.650 mg/kg), of beta HCH in 7 samples (0.006; 0.008; 0.022; 0.024; 0.026; 0.029 and 0.049 mg/kg), higher DDT sum were recorded in 3 samples (0.053; 0.074 and 0.126 mg/kg) and higher PCB sum in 8 samples (0.057; 0.066; 0.101; 0.134; 0.164; 0.426; 0.821 and 1.202 mg/kg). The highest average concentration of hazardous pollutants in dust depositions (n = 30) in both feed mixture plants was determined in lead (4.122 mg/kg), in a descending order followed by PCB sum (0.151 mg/kg), cadmium (0.127 mg/kg), DDT sum (0.030 mg/kg), mercury (0.019 mg/kg), lindane (0.013 mg/kg), beta HCH (0.010 mg/kg), HCB (0.004 mg/kg and alpha HCH (0.001 mg/kg). Out of PCB indicator congeners, dust depositions contained the highest quantities of congener 138 (0.022 mg/kg), congener 180 (0.018 mg/kg) and congener 153 (0.015 mg/kg). Isomer p,p-DDT was dominant in dust depositions among DDT isomers (0.019 mg/kg). Dust depositions sampled from the indoor equipment of feed mixture plants are a promising indicator of produced feed mixtures contamination with hazardous pollutants. To seek sources of feed mixtures contamination is a permanent task of veterinary service.

TI  - Supported liquid membrane enrichment combined with atomic absorption spectrometry for the determination of lead in urine.  
AB  - Supported liquid membrane (SLM) methodology was used for sample clean-up and enrichment of lead in urine prior to determination by AAS. Lead ions at pH 3 were extracted across a membrane solution containing 40% m/m di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid dissolved in kerosene and back-extracted into an acceptor solution of 1 mol l-1 nitric acid. The mechanism of mass transfer is a proton gradient across the membrane. The concentration range investigated was between 5 and 80 ng ml-1 and the extraction time was varied between 0.5 and 4 h, leading to enrichment factors of up to 200. The extraction efficiency was about 95%. The detection limit, expressed as 3 sigma of five replicate determinations, using a 45 min enrichment of a urine sample low in lead, was 0.1 and 6.0 micrograms l-1 for ETAAS, and FAAS respectively. The results obtained by the developed method agreed with those obtained by direct ICP-MS determinations for reference urine samples and samples from occupationally lead-exposed workers. The linear correlation coefficient was 0.97, the slope of the regression line was 1.06 and the intercept was -0.37 microgram l-1. The 95% confidence intervals for the slope and the intercept were 0.95 to 1.18 and -3.9 to 3.1, respectively. The results at the 95% confidence level for reference urine material were of 91 +/- 1.5 and 92 +/- 2.0 micrograms l-1 for ICP-MS and SLM-AAS, respectively, which agreed well with the recommended value of 90 micrograms l-1 (range 83-97 micrograms l-1).

Images of these deposits (cholesterol, bilirubin, and protein) were formed in real colors (blue-cholesterol, red, orange-bilirubin, yellow, green-protein) in accordance with the cathodoluminescent spectrum for each control material. The other method described for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of ultrathin sections provides more detailed characterization of the ultrastructure of cholesterol-containing regions and their spatial interrelations with bilirubin-containing regions. Using CCL-SEM combined with TEM permits the receipt of more complete information about the chemical composition and ultrastructure of gallstones and may lead to more effective understanding of the pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis.

TI  - A novel class of orally active non-peptide bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists. 1. Construction of the basic framework.  
AB  - A novel class of potent, selective, and orally active non-peptide bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonists were designed and synthesized starting from 8-benzyloxyimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative 2.  The unique screening lead (2) was discovered by a two-step intentional random screening process, involving recognition of the relationship between BK and angiotensin II (Ang II) and the common structural features. Systematic chemical modification of 2 elucidated the structural requirements essential for B2 binding affinity leading to the identification of 8-[[3-(N-acylglycyl-N-methylamino)-2,6-dichlorobenzyl]oxy]-3-halo- 2- methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine skeleton as the basic framework of this new series of B2 antagonists. A molecular modeling study suggested the key role of the N-methylanilide moiety at the 3-position of the 2,6-dichlorobenzene ring to allow these compounds to adopt the characteristic active conformation. The representative lead compounds inhibited the specific binding of [3H]BK to guinea pig ileum membrane preparations expressing B2 receptors, with nanomolar IC50S and also displayed in vivo functional antagonistic activities against BK-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic studies of compounds 47c and 50b in rats highlighted their excellent oral bioavailabilities, indicating that they represent the first orally active non-peptide B2 antagonists reported to date.

TI  - Infections with nonthoracotomy implantable cardioverter defibrillators: can these be prevented? Endotak Lead Clinical Investigators.  
AB  - Nonthoracotomy ICDs are believed to be the best therapeutic modality for treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Little is known about the risk of infection with initial implantation of these devices. We studied the incidence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors associated with infections in 1,831 patients with nonthoracotomy ICD from the Endotak-C nonthoracotomy lead registry of Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. A transvenous lead was implanted in 950 patients (51.9%) and a combination transvenous plus subcutaneous patch was used in 881 patients (48.1%). Nine preselected data variables were studied, and all investigators identified as having patients with infections were personally contacted. Infections occurred in 22 (1.2%) of 1,831 patients receiving this nonthoracotomy ICD system. The mean time to infection was 5.7 +/- 6.5 months (range 1-25 months). Staphylococci were isolated in 58% of patients with reported infection. The presence of a subcutaneous defibrillator patch system was associated with the development of infection. Six of 950 patients (0.63%) with a totally transvenous lead system developed infection versus 16 of 838 (1.9%) patients with a transvenous lead plus subcutaneous patch system configuration (P = 0.015, Chi-square test), with an unadjusted estimated odds ratio of 3.06 (CI 1.19-7.86). The risk of infection encountered with the nonthoracotomy ICD is low, estimated from our data to be 1.2%. Placement of a subcutaneous defibrillator patch appears to be an independent risk factor for development of infection.

TI  - The soft tissue response to osseointegrated dental implants.  
AB  - The use of dental implants in the treatment of fully edentulous patients has become an important addition in oral/dental rehabilitation. The fact that these implants penetrate the oral mucosa can lead to the assumption that peri-implant tissues, similar to the periodontal tissues, are fulfilling an important function as a barrier to protect the bony anchorage underneath. It has been shown that insufficient plaque removal may lead to peri-implant tissue disease with bone loss similar to teeth. However, it is unclear how important this cause is as a source of implant failure compared with other factors, such as inadequate bone healing, unfavorable quantity and quality of bone, or (bio)mechanical and functional problems. It is also not understood if peri-implant epithelium and connective tissue are equally needed and/or qualified to slow down or prevent tissue breakdown as their periodontal counterparts. The scientific work focusing on peri-implant soft tissues has dramatically increased in the past few years. Most studies to date have examined and described their structure but little data exist on their true biologic function. This review analyzes the current understanding of morphologic and clinical features of the peri-implant soft tissues. Furthermore, evidence shall be provided that peri-implant soft tissues do not interfere with the current favorable results obtained when treating the edentulous patient with osseointegrated implants.

TI  - [Proposed medical record to be used in rape cases. New diagnostic and medicolegal aspects]  
AB  - The latest report of 1996 on human development in the UN development programme (UNDP) states that 130,000 women are raped every year in the industrialized countries. Illegal "violation" is defined as the sexual penetration of any orifice of the body without the victim's consent. The doctor's contribution is essential in order to ascertain this offence. It can be divided into two stages: precise and complete (... missing? ...) information regarding the sexual aggression which might have taken the form of rape. Management of a rape case represents an extremely complex undertaking for the doctor since it involves medical and legal aspects and requires a number of interventions that lead to a rational evaluation and appropriate treatment. In this context, the doctor's role is not only to protect the psychophysical integrity of the victim, but also to contribute, following an early diagnosis of sexual aggression, to the identification of the particulars of an offence which still risks remaining unpunished, owing to the difficulty of diagnosis and in spite of the recent enactment of Law no. 66 on 15 February 1996. The medical record proposed by the authors consists of a descriptive anamnestic part and a graphic part, thus making the evaluation of the victim more rapid and precise. The proposed medical record is subdivided into anamnesis, objective examination, psychological examination, laboratory tests, any consultancy requested and therapy.

The reverse transcriptase of the M184V mutant has been reported to have a higher fidelity. Our experiments showed that there was no significant delay in virus breakthrough of the M184V mutant as compared with the wild-type virus. We therefore conclude that the reported higher fidelity of the M184V mutant does not lead to a delay in the development of resistance to the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and loviride.

TI  - Subchondral bone failure in an equine model of overload arthrosis.  
AB  - Gross examination of metacarpo-/metatarsophalangeal (fetlock) joints from racehorses revealed defects on the condylar surface that ranged from cartilage fibrillation and erosion to focal cartilage indentations and cavitation in subchondral bone characteristic of traumatic osteochondrosis. Because these lesions represented a spectrum of mechanically induced arthrosis in which microdamage is thought to play a role, a histologic study of sagittal sections was made to study the morphogenesis. Subchondral bone failure developed beneath a flattened section of the condyle where the margin of the sesamoid bone produces compression as well as shear on impact of the foot with the ground. Milder lesions had thickening of subchondral bone and underlying trabeculae. With advancing sclerosis an increased amount of osteocyte necrosis was present. Occasional vascular channels with plugs of matrix debris and cells were present just beneath the cartilage. There was increased prominence of subchondral vessels, and osteoclastic remodeling was seen in and around the sclerotic zone. Apparent fragmentation lines in the subchondral bone suggested increased matrix fragility. Irregular trabecular microfractures developed at a depth of a few millimeters. Increased vascularity with hemorrhage, fibrin, and fibroplasia could be seen in enlarged marrow spaces at this more advanced stage. The overlying articular cartilage was variably indented but remained largely viable with degeneration and erosion limited to the superficial layers. Focally, breaks in the calcified layer appeared to lead to collapse and cartilage infolding. In metacarpal condyles from experimental horses run on a treadmill, there were milder changes at the site. The subchondral bone was increased in volume and there was increased diffuse staining with basic fuchsin, but no increase in the number of microcracks was seen. The findings in the racehorses indicate that the equine fetlock condyle is a consistent site of overload arthrosis in which microfracture and failure in subchondral bone may occur. Controlled exercise in treadmill horses may provide a model in which to study the pathogenesis.

TI  - Effect of temazepam on oxygen saturation and sleep quality at high altitude: randomised placebo controlled crossover trial.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of temazepam on the quality of sleep and on oxygen saturation during sleep in subjects at high altitude. DESIGN: Randomised, blinded, crossover, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Base camp at Mount Everest (altitude 5300 m). SUBJECTS: 11 members of British Mount Everest Medical Expedition recently arrived at base camp. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to receive either temazepam 10 mg or placebo on their first night at base camp and the other treatment on the second night. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of sleep (assessed subjectively), mean arterial oxygen saturation value, and changes in saturation values (as measure of periodic breathing) while participants taking temazepam or placebo. RESULTS: All participants noted subjective improvements in sleep. Mean saturation value remained unchanged when temazepam was compared with placebo (74.65% v 75.70%, P = 0.5437). There were fewer changes in oxygen saturation when participants took temazepam and when measured as decreases > 4% below the mean value of saturation each hour (P = 0.0036, paired Student's t test (two tailed)). CONCLUSIONS: Participants taking temazepam at 5300 m showed no significant drop in mean oxygen saturation values during sleep. Both the number and severity of changes in saturation during sleep decreased and the quality of sleep improved. This may be a result of a reduction in the number of awakenings and might lead to greater respiratory stability and fewer episodes of periodic breathing. This has the effect of improving the quality of sleep and reducing the number of periods of desaturation during sleep.

Androl., 17: 659, 1996). In the first procedure, the free forms of hK2 co-migrated with PSA during the CM-Sephadex and the Sephacryl S-200 steps. By contrast, in the second procedure a very high proportion of hK2 was separated from PSA. In two different Sensabaugh and Blake procedures, the hK2 contamination per microg. of PSA was found to be respectively 0.3 and 1.0 ng. We conclude that hK2 is a quantitatively minor contaminant of some PSA preparations. That contamination is probably of little consequence for PSA standardization but it could lead to erroneous conclusions in enzymatic studies of PSA.

TI  - A fifty percent reduction of platelet surface glycoprotein Ib does not affect platelet adhesion under flow conditions.  
AB  - Glycoprotein (GP) Ib is an adhesion receptor on the platelet surface that binds to von Willebrand Factor (vWF). vWF becomes attached to collagens and other adhesive proteins that become exposed when the vessel wall is damaged. Several investigators have shown that during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and also during platelet activation in vitro by thrombin or thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) GPIb disappears from the platelet surface. Such a disappearance is presumed to lead to a decreased adhesive capacity. In the present study, we show that a 65% decrease in platelet surface expression of GPIb, due to stimulation of platelets in Orgaran anticoagulated whole blood with 15 micromol/L TRAP, had no effect on platelet adhesion to both collagen type III and the extracellular matrix (ECM) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells under flow conditions in a single-pass perfusion system. In contrast to adhesion, ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was highly dependent on the presence of GPIb. Immunoelectron microscopic studies showed that GPIb almost immediately returned to the platelet surface once platelets had attached to collagen. In a subsequent series of experiments, we showed that when less than 50% of GPIb was blocked by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against GPIb (6D1), platelet adhesion under flow conditions remained unaffected.

TI  - Secondary structure formation in N-substituted peptides.  
AB  - A systematic conformational analysis on several model peptides with N-substituted amino acids was performed on the basis of ab initio MO theory at the HF/6-31G* and HF/3-21G levels with inclusion of solvation effects to study the influence of N-substitution on the formation of typically secondary structural elements, e.g. beta sheets, helices and turns. The conformational flexibility of some structures was examined by means of molecular dynamics simulations in the gas phase and in solution. The results show a restriction of the conformational flexibility of the peptide chain after introduction of an N-substituted amino acid. N-substitution makes beta sheet formation more difficult. Several consecutive N-substituted amino acids in a sequence lead to conformers different from those found on the energy hypersurface of the corresponding N-unsubstituted peptides. There is a strong tendency to form periodically helical conformations, e.g. the polyglycine II or the alpha helix, which can be extended over several N-substituted amino acid residues. As long as 1<--4 hydrogen bond formation remains possible, the major types of beta turns can be formed with a distinct preference for the betaII and betaVIa turns. The betaI turn in particular is considerably destabilized.

TI  - [Implication of lead poisoning in psychopathology of Vincent van Gogh]  
AB  - The authors, by means of documental research, study the possibility that the physical and psychic symptoms of Vincent van Gogh may have been due to chronic lead poisoning. The technique and materials used by Van Gogh are analysed as the cause of repeated exposure to lead as well as the possible means of penetration of the metal. Through historical-biographical analysis, the progressive symptoms of the illness are compared with those of lead poisoning. The authors conclude that the excessive and continuous use by Van Gogh of pigments which were highly toxic due to their high lead content, such as white lead (lead carbonate) and yellow chrome (lead chromium), could have penetrated his organism by digestive system (primarily) in minimal daily amounts, giving rise to a clinical condition of chronic lead poisoning. This type of poisoning coincides with the clinical symptoms Van Gogh describes in his autographed letters: initial debilitation, stomatitis with loss of teeth, recurring abdominal pains, anaemia (with a "plumbic" skin tone), neuropathy of the radial and saturnine encephalopathy including epileptic crises, progressive character changes and periods of delirium. The clinical symptoms shown by Van Gogh meet present criteria for diagnosis of Organic Mental Disorder due to cerebral lesion or somatic illness (F.06; CIE-10) (DSM-IV-R), and Organic Character Disorder (F.07; CIE-10) (DSM-IV-R).

TI  - [Lead poisoning caused by a Greek ceramic cup]  
AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 24-year-old woman, an administrative employee, was admitted with colicky abdominal pain and constipation, as well as breathing-related chest pain of recent onset with cough and sometimes blood-streaked sputum. She had previously been unsuccessfully treated for gastritis and adnexitis. On physical examination revealed diffuse, ill-defined abdominal pain on pressure and mild tachycardia, but was otherwise unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Electrocardiogram, chest radiogram, lung scintigraphy, abdominal sonography, oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and gynaecological examination indicated nothing abnormal. Laboratory tests showed microcytic anemia, slight leucocytosis and anisocytosis, as well as polychromasia and basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. The 24-h urinary porphyrin concentration was elevated. DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT AND COURSE: Precise differentiation of porphyrins in urine, stool and erythrocytes by enzymatic measurement first raised the suspicion of lead poisoning. Whole-blood lead concentration was markedly raised to 600 micrograms/l (normal up to 90 micrograms/l) and 170 micrograms/dl in urine (normal up to 80 micrograms/dl). A ceramic cup from Greece was traced as the source of the lead, the patients having regularly for over 2 1/2 months drunk lemon instant-tea from it. She was treated with oral doses of DMPS (sodium salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulphonic acid), 5-10 mg/kg 3x daily for 2 days, followed by 2.5 mg/kg 2 x daily, until lead concentrations in blood and urine had become normal, when all symptoms disappeared: detoxification was complete within 4 months. CONCLUSION: This case impressively illustrates how difficult it can be to diagnose lead poisoning and identify its source. Oral DMPS is a practicable and efficacious form of treatment.

TI  - Identification of artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV) proteins required for virus replication: complementation of AMCV p33 and p92 replication-defective mutants.  
AB  - Mutagenesis of the artichoke mottled crinkle virus (AMCV) genome and complementation studies between replication-defective mutants were undertaken to identify viral protein(s) essential for AMCV replication. Inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts with mutant transcripts revealed that null mutations in ORFs 1 [tA33(-)], 2 [tA92(-)] and 6 [tA7(-)], as well as an ORF 2 mutation [tA92GED] in the GDD motif of the 92 kDa protein, the putative replicase, prevented accumulation of detectable levels of progeny RNA. Conversely, mutations of ORFs 3 [tA41(-)], 4 [tA21(-)] and 5 [tA19(-)] did not substantially affect the accumulation of AMCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs of both positive and negative polarity. Inoculation of N. benthamiana plants with transcripts impaired in replication revealed that tA92(-) and tA7(-) mutants lead to replicating pseudorevertants. Functional analysis of these pseudorevertants showed that: (i) the double stop codon introduced at the end of ORF 1 to prevent the translational readthrough of the 92 kDa protein reverted to a single amber, ochre or opal codon, giving rise to viable genomes; (ii) the putative 7 kDa protein is not essential for genome viability, although the RNA region spanning ORF 6 plays a role in cis in replication. Finally, the two replication-defective mutants tA33(-) and tA92(-) complemented when co-inoculated to N. benthamiana protoplasts, definitively proving that the 33 kDa protein is essential for tombusvirus genome replication. Analysis of viral RNAs from the coinfection experiments showed that tA92(-) was preferentially amplified over tA33(-).

TI  - Number of perifoveal vessels in aging, hypertension, and atherosclerosis: the Rotterdam Study.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the associations among age, gender, hypertension, atherosclerosis, combined hypertension and atherosclerosis, and the number of perifoveal retinal arterioles and venules in the general elderly population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among subjects ranging in age from 55 to 74 years who participated in the population-based Rotterdam Study. Perifoveal vessels were counted in a masked way by two observers within 1500 microm from the foveola on fundus transparencies of 34 cases with hypertension, 55 with lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD), 27 with hypertension and LEAD, and 194 control subjects without either condition. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to study the associations. RESULTS: The mean number of perifoveal vessels was 12.0 (SD 2.0). The number of perifoveal vessels decreased with age in all groups, with an average of 0.4 per 5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2, 0.6, P=0.001). In women, the number of perifoveal vessels was on average 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3, 1.2, P=0.002) lower than in men. Patients with hypertension had a significantly lower number of vessels compared with control subjects: mean reduction 1.0 (95% CI, 0.2, 1.7), independent of age and sex. Patients with LEAD had 1.0 (95% CI, 0.4, 1.6) fewer perifoveal vessels, whereas the number in those with hypertension and LEAD was 1.8 (95% (CI, 1.0, 2.6) lower. Additional adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors did not materially alter the findings. CONcLUSIONS: Increasing age, female gender, systemic hypertension, and LEAD were associated with a lower number of perifoveal arterioles and venules in the elderly.

TI  - Mechanisms of acquired thymic tolerance in vivo: intrathymic injection of antigen induces apoptosis of thymocytes and peripheral T cell anergy.  
AB  - Intrathymic injection of Ag induces Ag-specific tolerance in several clinically relevant experimental autoimmune and transplantation models. However, the exact mechanisms of acquired thymic tolerance in vivo remain unclear. We investigated the mechanisms of acquired thymic tolerance in mice that are transgenic for the TCR specific for peptide 323-339 of OVA. Intrathymic injection of OVA leads to apoptosis of thymocytes starting as early as 3 h after injection and persisting up to 7 days. Double positive thymocytes undergo apoptosis earlier than single positive thymocytes, and significantly higher percentages of double positive thymocytes ultimately die as compared with single positive cells. Apoptotic cells show decreased surface expression of CD4. In the periphery, T cells from intrathymically injected animals had suppressed proliferation and IL-2 production to OVA compared with T cells from control Ag-injected mice. We conclude that intrathymic injection of Ag induces apoptosis of immature thymocytes and a subpopulation of mature thymocytes and induces prolonged anergy in peripheral T cells in vivo. Understanding the mechanisms of acquired thymic tolerance may lead to development of novel clinical strategies to prevent autoimmune disease and transplant rejection.

AB  - Sepsis from an infected cardiac valve can lead to bacterial seeding and destruction of the arterial wall with formation of a mycotic aneurysm. The natural history of these lesions is the rupture. We report the case of a 20 year old female who was admitted to our institution with massive mitral regurgitation and emboli of the central nervous system and both lower extremities. She underwent emergency valve replacement and then, staged treatment of her ischemic legs and multiple asymptomatic mycotic aneurysms: Superior mesenteric, right common iliac and left superficial femoral arteries. A splenectomy was required to treat a splenic abscess. An aneurysm of a peripheral branch of the middle cerebral artery was medically treated, demonstrating reduction in size on subsequent angiogram. She recovered uneventfully and remains asymptomatic after 20 months of follow up. The development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools has led to a decrease of these complications during infectious endocarditis. However, in the patient with late diagnosis and symptoms in different territories, the mycotic aneurysm must be kept in mind to provide the patient with appropriate treatment.

TI  - Position paper of the American Council on Science and Health: lead and human health.  
AB  - The potential human health risk of lead in the environment remains a topic of current debate and concern. Given sufficient exposure, lead can exert severe and chronic health effects. Today, due to successful efforts to reduce the commercial use of lead and control its release to the environment, lead "poisoning" is uncommon in our society. Blood-lead levels among the U.S. population, including those of children, have decreased dramatically over the past decade and according to current surveillance programs continue to decline. Because lead poisoning among children is no longer as prevalent as it once was, the focus has shifted to the long-term effects lead may exert on the intellectual development of children. Continued toxicological and epidemiological research will expand the understanding of this important facet of the lead issue. Trace levels of lead in consumer products remain a low health risk to humans, despite the fear and uncertainty which often accompany such concerns. Future efforts to reduce lead exposure should be aimed at high-risk groups which include the socioeconomically disadvantaged and certain minority sectors of the population. Through educational programs, improvement in personal hygiene practices, and abatement of lead-containing paint (when warranted), blood lead levels should continue to decline, reducing the health risk to lead in the environment.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether repeat boluses of diazepam (DZP) lead to significant accumulation in the central nervous system and/or peripheral compartments, as repeat intravenous boluses of diazepam are commonly used in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). METHODS: In a rat model that permits simultaneous serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, we characterized the pharmacokinetics of DZP and its metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, in CSF and blood using HPLC. DZP was administered by intraperitoneal injection as either a single dose (20 or 30 mg/kg) or repeat doses (10 or 20 mg/kg x 3, 1 h apart). RESULTS: After a single intraperitoneal dose, DZP was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration of 10 min. The serum concentrations then declined biexponentially. DZP rapidly entered the CSF, the CSF to serum ratio reached equilibrium within 10 min, and was equivalent to the ratio of free to total serum concentration. Repeated DZP dosing resulted in a threefold decrease in volume of distribution and clearance (p < 0.001). This was reflected in the CSF concentration data; however, after the third dose, the ratio of CSF to serum concentration, also increased greatly, representing further persistence of DZP in the CSF compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat dosing of DZP leads to substantial accumulation, and high, persistent serum and CSF concentrations, which may explain the toxic effects of repeat DZP dosing. Repeat dosing of DZP using a tapering protocol, however, may increase the effectiveness of DZP in treating SE by preventing relapses without substantially increasing toxicity.

TI  - A human brain L-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase is identical to an amyloid beta-peptide-binding protein involved in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - A novel L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from human brain has been cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. This enzyme is a homotetramer with a molecular mass of 108 kDa. Its subunit consists of 261 amino acid residues and has structural features characteristic of short chain dehydrogenases. It was found that the amino acid sequence of this human brain enzyme is identical to that of an endoplasmic reticulum amyloid beta-peptide-binding protein (ERAB), which mediates neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (Yan, S. D., Fu, J., Soto, C., Chen, X., Zhu, H., Al-Mohanna, F., Collison, K., Zhu, A., Stern, E., Saido, T., Tohyama, M., Ogawa, S., Roher, A., and Stern, D. (1997) Nature 389, 689-695). The purification of human brain short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase made it possible to characterize the structural and catalytic properties of ERAB. This NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs to form 3-ketoacyl-CoAs, but it does not act on the D-isomers. The catalytic rate constant of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 37 s-1 with apparent Km values of 89 and 20 &mgr;M for acetoacetyl-CoA and NADH, respectively. The activity ratio of this enzyme for substrates with chain lengths of C4, C8, and C16 was approximately 1:2:2. The human short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene is organized into six exons and five introns and maps to chromosome Xp11.2. The amino-terminal NAD-binding region of the dehydrogenase is encoded by the first three exons, whereas the other exons code for the carboxyl-terminal substrate-binding region harboring putative catalytic residues. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that ERAB involved in neuronal dysfunction is encoded by the human short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene.

TI  - Occupational lead exposure and screening of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphism: useful prevention or nonvoluntary discrimination?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss regulatory guidelines excluding subjects with erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency from lead-exposed jobs in the light of epidemiology findings on the mortality of these subjects. METHODS: Two mortality follow-up studies were conducted. The first comprised 1979 male subjects newly identified as G6PD-deficient during a 1981 screening of the G6PD polymorphism among the general population in Sardinia, Italy. The second comprised 1080 male workers employed in maintenance and production departments of a lead smelting plant, who were divided into two subcohorts by erythrocyte G6PD phenotype. RESULTS: As compared with the general male population, G6PD-deficient subjects had significantly fewer deaths than expected from ischemic heart disease (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 28; 95% CI 10-62), cerebrovascular diseases (SMR = 22; 95% CI 6-55), and liver cirrhosis (SMR = 12; 95% CI 0-66). Among lead smelters the standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases and all cancers observed among the G6PD-deficient subcohort were lower than those seen among subjects with the wild-type G6PD. No death from disease of the blood and hematopoietic system was observed among G6PD-deficient subjects in these two follow-up studies. CONCLUSIONS: These studies did not provide evidence of hypersensitivity to lead hematotoxicity among G6PD-deficient individuals at exposure levels within the current standards. Provided that workplace exposure complies with current standards, the hypothetical benefit of excluding G6PD-deficient individuals from lead-exposed jobs should be weighted against the loss of personal abilities and the economic damage in a social environment with diffuse unemployment.

TI  - Bile acid diarrhea.  
AB  - Bile acids normally undergo enterohepatic circulation. When this circulation is interrupted, bile acids enter the colon in increased concentrations. Here, they produce Cl- secretion by a calcium- and cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism, resulting in diarrhea. Cholestasis may lead to serum bile acid concentrations high enough to produce colonic secretion by serosal surface effects. When resection or disease interferes with ileal function, the resulting diarrhea can be clearly attributed to bile acid malabsorption. In other states, such as postcholecystectomy diarrhea and idiopathic bile acid diarrhea, the role of bile acids is less well defined. 23-75Selena-25-homotaurocholic acid provides a way of tracing the metabolism of bile acids and their enterohepatic circulation in vivo. Metabolized similarly to natural bile acids, its circulation is easily traced by scintigraphy. Barium x-rays, serum concentrations of bile acids or bile acid intermediates, and tests of vitamin B12 absorption provide indirect measures of ileal function. Careful history and examination combined with one of many the available tests of ileal function allow a diagnosis. A therapeutic trial with a bile acid binding resin confirms the impression and treats the diarrhea.

TI  - Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia-telangiectasia patients: possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5.  
AB  - The ATM (A-T, mutated) gene on human chromosome 11q22.3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). In order to define the types of disease-causing ATM mutations in Japanese A-T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots, reverse-transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A-T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method. As has been reported by others, mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants. Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined. Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon: exon 7, exon 16, exon 33 or exon 35. The others were minute deletions, 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55. The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families; 44% (7 of 16) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations. The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T-->A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33. Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations. This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles.

AB  - In this study the disposition of 1,2-[14C]dibromoethane (1, 2-[14C]DBE) was investigated in male Wistar rats. 1,2-DBE is a cytotoxic and carcinogenic compound that has been used as an additive in leaded gasoline and as a fumigant. 1,2-[14C]DBE was administered orally or iv. Radioactivity was recovered (mostly within 48 hr after administration) in urine (75-82% of the dose), feces (3.2-4% of the dose), and expired air (0.53-7.2% of the dose). One hundred-sixty-eight hours after administration of 1,2-[14C]DBE, most of the radioactivity in tissues was found in the liver, lungs, and kidneys (<1% of the dose) and the red blood cells (0.3% of the dose). Identified urinary metabolites were S-(2-hydroxyethyl)mercapturic acid, thiodiacetic acid, and thiodiacetic acid sulfoxide, together accounting for, on average, 78% of the total amount of radioactivity in urine. In addition to S-(2-hydroxyethyl)mercapturic acid, thiodiacetic acid, and thiodiacetic acid sulfoxide, several compounds were anticipated as potential urinary metabolites of 1,2-DBE, i.e. S-(carboxymethyl)mercapturic acid, S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thioacetic acid, S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiopyruvic acid, S-(carboxymethyl)thiopyruvic acid, S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiolactic acid, and S-(carboxymethyl)thiolactic acid. All of the postulated urinary metabolites were synthesized and searched for in urine samples. None of these metabolites could be detected in urine, however. The data obtained in the present study might be useful for risk assessment and biomonitoring studies of 1,2-DBE and will also be used to further validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for 1, 2-DBE in rats and humans that was recently developed.

TI  - Heat shock or stress proteins and their role as autoantigens in multiple sclerosis.  
AB  - Stress or heat shock proteins are constitutively expressed in normal CNS tissues, in a variety of cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons). Their presence may protect cells from various stresses, such as hypoxia, anoxia, and excessive excitatory stimulation. Increased amounts of hsp are expressed in various cells of the CNS during acute toxic-metabolic states and in chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Increased expression of hsp may lead to immune responses to these proteins. Antibodies to mycobacterial hsp bind to normal human myelin and to oligodendrocytes in regions of MS demyelination. Cellular immune responses to hsp occur with increased frequency and magnitude in persons with MS, especially those with recent onset of disease. In addition, there are populations of T cells expressing gamma/delta antigen receptors in the brains and spinal fluids of persons with MS, suggesting an in situ immune response to hsp. Humoral immune responses to hsp are found in CSF, but no disease specificity has been documented. Some myelin proteins have sequence homology with particular hsp. One instance is the homology between a peptide of mycobacterial HSP 65 and the myelin protein CNP. Our data in EAE suggest that immune responses to either cross-reactive epitopes or whole hsp can modify the course of both acute and chronic relapsing EAE. These data support the hypothesis that an immune response to an infectious agent's hsp could result in a cross-reactive immune response to CNS myelin, or to responses to endogenous, CNS-expressed hsp, resulting in demyelination. This may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of MS.

For the dermatologist, the importance of GvHD is real and current. Indeed, because it has become easier to perform bone marrow transplantation (EMT), the indications of BMT have become broader, making follow-up of patients receiving grafts a widespread practice. Nonetheless, GvHD remains a frequent complication of BMT and its principal target organ is the skin. Furthermore, recent innovations, such as grafting of umbilical cord blood and the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells, will be the source of new questions concerning the development of GvHD under these conditions. Finally, because of its analogies with other spontaneous idiopathic skin diseases, GvHD constitutes a model that may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological features of these diseases.

Both models give rise to a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength and altered unit discharge patterns. The present paper reviews synaptic plasticity in the neocortex of awake freely moving rats following both single and multiple sessions of activation with high-frequency, tetanic electrical stimulation. The phenomenology of neocortical post-activation potentiation and some possible underlying mechanisms are discussed. We speculate that the functional significance of potentiated responses may reflect a reorganization of the neocortex in a manner similar to those that create and define receptive fields.

METHODS: Replicas of an ulcerated atherosclerotic human carotid bulb were created using the lost wax technique. The resulting replicas were placed in a circuit of pulsating non-Newtonian fluid and flows were adjusted to replicate human physiological flow profiles. Common carotid artery total flow volumes of 400, 600, and 800 mL/min were studied. Slipstreams were opacified with isobaric dyes. Images were recorded on 35 mm film and on super VHS video. A pressure recording device was calibrated; data were received from needles placed radially and longitudinally in the common carotid artery, narrowed bulb/ulcer, and internal carotid artery. Multiple pressure recordings were obtained in the replicas. RESULTS: Measurements of the replica showed a 59% diameter stenosis and an 88% area stenosis of the carotid bulb with a shallow 3.3-mm ulcer. Analysis of flow in the common carotid artery showed undisturbed slipstreams, but as these streams entered the narrowed carotid bulb they crowded together and accelerated significantly. This accelerated jet continued for at least two vessel diameters into the more normal portions of the internal carotid artery, where flow remained disturbed peripherally and often assumed a helical pattern but was nonturbulent. As fluid entered the narrowed bulb, radial pressures decreased. Most important, at peak systole, lower radial pressure with a vortex circulation was found at the ulceration. CONCLUSION: This combination of events (ie, slowly swirling fluid within the ulcer, allowing platelet aggregates to form, and the intermittent Bernoulli effect, pulling the aggregates into the rapidly flowing blood) may help explain how ulcerated carotid plaques lead to embolic stroke.

TI  - Characterization of t(2;5) reciprocal transcripts and genomic breakpoints in CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferations.  
AB  - NPM-ALK chimeric transcripts, encoded by the t(2;5), lead to an aberrant expression of ALK by CD30+ systemic lymphomas. To determine if t(2;5) is involved in cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders, we studied 37 CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferations, 27 mycosis fungoides (MF), and 16 benign inflammatory disorders (BID). NPM-ALK transcripts were detected by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 1 of 11 lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), 7 of 15 CD30+ primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 3 of 11 CD30+ secondary cutaneous lymphoma, 6 of 27 MF, and 1 of 16 BID. However, the expression of NPM-ALK transcripts was not associated with ALK1 immunoreactivity in MF, LyP, or BID cases. Only 1 CD30+ primary CTCL and 3 CD30+ secondary cutaneous lymphoma were ALK1 immunoreactive. The ALK1+ cases were also characterized by amplification of tumor-specific genomic breakpoints on derivative chromosome 5. These cases, except for 1 secondary cutaneous lymphoma, were also characterized by reciprocal breakpoints on derivative chromosome 2, leading to the expression of reciprocal ALK-NPM transcripts. Amplification of chromosomal breakpoints on both derivative chromosomes could represent an alternative to conventional cytogenetics for the diagnosis of t(2;5) and seems to be more reliable than the detection of cryptic NPM-ALK transcripts by nested RT-PCR.

TI  - Coronary artery disease in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with lower extremity arterial disease: A report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study Registry.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) are at an increased risk of having coronary artery disease (CAD). Diabetics are at especially high risk for having LEAD with concomitant CAD. This study was undertaken (1) to define the clinical and arteriographic features associated with CAD among diabetics and nondiabetics with LEAD and (2) to determine the long-term survival and predictors of mortality of diabetics and nondiabetics with LEAD and CAD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three diabetics and 1137 nondiabetics from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study who had evidence of LEAD, who were 50 years and older, and who had arteriographically proven CAD were monitored for a mean of 12.8 years. RESULTS: Among all the subjects with LEAD there was a high prevalence of current and past smoking, history of previous myocardial infarction, systemic hypertension, congestive heart failure, high degrees of angina pectoris and unstable angina pectoris, and use of beta-blockers. On arteriographic evaluation a high prevalence of three-vessel epicardial coronary disease and involvement of multiple coronary segments with > or =50% diameter narrowing was found. Multivariate analysis showed the number of coronary segments with >50% occlusion, the presence of cerebrovascular disease, the use of digitalis, and elevated systolic blood pressure were independently associated with diabetes. On follow-up diabetics had a significantly higher mortality rate (mostly cardiac) than nondiabetics: median survival, 8.1 years and 12.7 years, respectively. At 15 years the mortality rates were 77.1% and 62.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age, number of coronary occlusions, number of significantly narrowed epicardial arteries, diminished myocardial contractility, hypertension, and smoking were significant predictors of mortality in the total group and in each subgroup. Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery was protective. The presence of diabetes was an independent risk factor for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of LEAD is associated with multivessel epicardial and multiple coronary segment occlusion. On long-term follow-up there is a high mortality rate. In patients with LEAD and diabetes, CAD is especially severe and prognosis is poor.

TI  - Skeletal muscle abnormalities in patients with fibromyalgia.  
AB  - Widespread muscle pain and tender points are the most common complaints of fibromyalgia patients, and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these symptoms have been studied intensively during the past decade. It has been suggested that fatigue and pain may lead to decreased levels of physical activity in many patients. The resulting deconditioned state may itself contribute to muscle abnormalities. Associated symptoms such as disturbed sleep, anxiety, depression, or irritable bowel also may have a negative impact on muscle function and level of daily activities. The important interactions between the central nervous and musculoskeletal systems may involve another element, the neuroendocrine stress-response system. This review will consider both the current state of knowledge and also future studies which might be designed to answer more effectively the outstanding questions regarding the underlying pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of beta 3-adrenergic agonists for the treatment and prevention of obesity in the dog. When a selective beta 3-adrenergic agonist, CL316,243 (0.1 mg/kg), was given orally to adult beagles every day for 5-7 weeks, body weight and girth were decreased compared with control placebo-treated dogs. Gross anatomical examinations revealed no noticeable abnormalities in CL316,243-treated dogs, except an apparent decrease in abdominal fat. Immunohistochemical examination of perirenal adipose tissue showed a remarkable increase in brown adipocytes expressing a thermogenic protein, uncoupling protein (UCP). The increased expression of UCP and its mRNA in CL316,243-treated dogs was also confirmed by Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. It was concluded that treatment with a beta 3-adrenergic agonist stimulates UCP expression, which may lead to an increase in energy expenditure, and thereby is useful for the treatment and prevention of obesity in the dog.

TI  - Endocrine mechanisms underlying the growth effects of developmental lead exposure in the rat.  
AB  - A dose-response study was conducted to examine the growth suppression associated with developmental lead exposure in a rat model and to determine the endocrine mechanisms underlying these effects. Ad libitum intake of lead acetate (0.05% to 0.45% w/v) was initiated in time-impregnated female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-15/group) at gestational day 5. At birth, pups were culled to four male and four females per litter. Lead exposure of dams continued until weaning, following which lead exposure of pups was continued until sacrifice at age 2 , 35, 55, and 85 days. Birth weight and prepubertal and pubertal growth rates were significantly suppressed. Growth rates were suppressed to a much greater degree in male as compared to female pups. Decreased growth rates were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) concentrations and (1) a significant increase in pituitary growth hormone (GH) content during puberty in pups of both sexes, (2) a delay in the developmental profiles of the GH-dependent male-specific liver enzymes cytochrome P-450 CYP2C11 and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene sulfotransferase, and (3) continued suppression of these enzymes in lead-exposed adult male pups. In addition, significant decreases in plasma sex steroids, testosterone (male) and 17beta-estradiol (female), were observed during puberty. Postpuberty, at age 85 d, both IGF1 and sex steroid levels were indistinguishable from control pups despite continued lead exposure. Growth rates were also similar in control and lead-exposed pups between age 57 and 85 d. Data suggest that the mechanism underlying lead-induced sex-independent suppression of growth observed in these studies involves disruption of GH secretion during puberty. It is possible that the mechanisms underlying the greater suppression of somatic growth observed at puberty in lead-exposed male offspring may be due to the additional hypoandrogenization produced by the action of lead on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.

TI  - Characterization of adrenal masses using unenhanced CT: an analysis of the CT literature.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Unenhanced CT scanning can reliably characterize incidentally detected adrenal masses when observers use density measurements of the adrenal gland. However, controversy exists as to the optimal density threshold required to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. This study attempts to establish a consensus by performing a pooled analysis of data found in the CT literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten CT reports were analyzed, from which individual adrenal lesion density measurements were obtained for 495 adrenal lesions (272 benign lesions and 223 malignant lesions). Threshold analysis generated a range of sensitivities and specificities for lesion characterization at different density thresholds. RESULTS: Sensitivity for characterizing a lesion as benign ranged from 47% at a threshold of 2 H to 88% at a threshold of 20 H. Similarly, specificity varied from 100% at a threshold of 2 H to 84% at a threshold of 20 H. CONCLUSION: The attempt to be absolutely certain that an adrenal lesion is benign may lead to an unacceptably low sensitivity for lesion characterization. The threshold chosen will depend on the patient population and the cost-benefit approach to patient care.

TI  - Low-level lead-induced neurotoxicity in children: an update on central nervous system effects.  
AB  - The neurotoxicity of low-level long-term exposure to lead has a special relevance in children. An extensive database has provided a direct link between low-level lead exposure and deficits in the neurobehavioral-cognitive performance evidenced in childhood through adolescence. Electrophysiological studies showed that neurosensory processing may be affected by lead, with consequent decrease in auditory sensitivity and visuomotor performance. Lead disrupts the main structural components of the blood-brain barrier by primary injury to astrocytes with a secondary damage to the endothelial microvasculature. Within the brain, lead-induced damage occurs preferentially in the prefrontal cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Some characteristic clinical features of lead poisoning may be attributed to this specific anatomical pattern. The cellular, intracellular and molecular mechanisms of lead neurotoxicity are numerous, as lead impacts many biological activities at different levels of control: at the voltage-gated channels and on the first, second and third messenger systems. These effects could be related to lead's ability to interfere with the regulatory action of calcium in cell functions. Consequently, it may be assumed that lead acts as a chemical stressor and causes breakdown of the homeostatic cellular mechanisms. This is expressed in both the anatomical site and the neurotransmitter systems which are crucial in modulating emotional response, memory and learning. There is no threshold below which lead remains without effect on the central nervous system; thus, symptoms could simply be a clinical reflection of the brain regions preferentially involved. In integrating these physiological and clinical data, it may be suggested that the different mechanisms of low level lead neurotoxicity have a final common functional pathway.

TI  - Sites of lead and nickel accumulation in the placental tissue.  
AB  - 1. There is a variety of quantitative analytical data regarding the total concentrations of heavy metals in human placentae. However, little is known about sites of metal accumulation in the placental tissue structural zones in relation to the environment. In this study, the lead and the nickel particulate deposits in the placental chorionic plate, the chorionic villous tree and the basal plate, using tissue histochemical reactions for lead and nickel, have been estimated. The degree of metal contamination of placentae was assessed according to an arbitrary scale. Both metals have shown a common mode of accumulation in the placental tissue structural zones. Among the observed contaminated structures in the placental tissue, the syncytiotrophoblast was the most frequent site for lead and nickel particulate deposits. 2. The frequency distribution of both metals within the mentioned placental zones, using four metal contamination degrees, was determined. A heavily contaminated zone was found to be the chorionic villous tree, especially in samples from the industrial region. 3. A comparison between two Slovak regions (an industrial and a rural one) using statistical tests was performed. The frequency of samples without any lead occurrence in the chorionic villous tree was found to be 10% in the industrial region, and 16% in the rural region. Regarding the nickel deposits, the frequency of non-contaminated samples in the industrial region was 2%, whereas in the rural region 6%. A relationship between traffic related pollution and human placenta contamination was found in both investigated regions.

TI  - Chromosome changes in a metastasis of a chromophobe renal cell tumor.  
AB  - Metastatic disease is a well-known complicating factor in the treatment of renal cell cancer. Whereas radical nephrectomy usually is curative in cases of localized disease, no adequate treatment has been established for metastatic renal tumors. Identification of specific chromosome changes or genes responsible for metastatic behavior may lead to new strategies of treatment in the future. In light of this, we cytogenetically analyzed a metastasis of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma arising in a 73-year-old male and compared the results with genetic data on primary chromophobe renal tumors. The chromosomal pattern of the present case showed, next to the extensive chromosome losses specific for the chromophobe subtype, structural rearrangements involving chromosomes 1, 5, 12, 15, and 18. Determining whether or not (some of) the observed structural changes are important for the metastatic behavior of chromophobe renal cell tumors will have to await further genetic studies on metastases of renal cancer.

TI  - Attempted unreamed nailing in tibial fractures: a prospective consecutive series of 55 patients.  
AB  - We evaluated the possibility of unreamed insertion of an intramedullary nail (IMN) in a consecutive series of 55 tibial shaft fractures in 55 patients (30 men). 43 fractures were closed and 12 fractures were open. All surgeons involved were instructed to try unreamed insertion primarily. Selection of nail diameter was based on measurements of the narrowest part of the medullary canal on preoperative AP- and lateral radiographs, with a millimeter-ruler. Of the 25 cases where a 9 mm nail was chosen, 10 were impossible to insert without reaming. An 8 mm nail was selected in the remaining 30 cases, and here 10 required reaming. Mean time-to-union was 4.2 months. Delayed union was noted in 9 patients of whom 6 had been stabilized with an unreamed nail. The concept of unreamed insertion must be questioned since this could be done in only 35 patients and, in addition, we were not able to demonstrate any significant differences in time-to-union in fractures stabilized with an unreamed or a reamed nail. Implant failures were seen in 5 patients, all stabilized with an 8 mm nail. Failure of interlocking screws did not affect the final outcome. However, a possible combination of screw breakage and healing disturbances may lead to the need for more complex surgical procedures. Due to these reasons and the fact that the 8 mm nail could not be inserted unreamed in 10 of 30 patients, we stopped using the 8 mm nail.

TI  - Expression and purification of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase from Escherichia coli.  
AB  - Pneumococcal hyaluronate lyase enzyme breaks down hyaluronan of the extracellular matrix of tissues and possibly contributes to the invasion of host tissue and to the penetration of host defenses by this bacterial pathogen. In light of the emergence of increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant strains, the understanding of the mechanism of action of hyaluronate lyase enzyme may lead to a better understanding of interactions between a host and bacterial pathogens and may contribute to more efficient treatment of bacterial infections. The native Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase enzyme has a molecular mass of 107 kDa but undergoes conversion to smaller enzymatically active forms. The truncated 83-kDa functional form of the enzyme has been cloned into the pET-21d vector, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity using a nickel affinity column with chelating Sepharose fast flow media. The recombinant enzyme is active and stable and the availability of large quantities of the enzyme will help in its biochemical and biophysical characterization. As a number of other Gram-positive surface proteins, it appears that the enzyme is anchored via its carboxy-terminal part to the pneumococcal cell wall by a covalent linkage with peptidoglycan structures.

TI  - [The future of psychiatric hospitals in Ontario]  
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review past and present roles and to speculate on the future of the Ontario provincial psychiatric hospitals (PPHs). Currently, and for the very immediate future only, there are 10 PPHs that are owned and operated by the Ministry of Health of Ontario, each serving a specified population ranging from 250,000 to over 3,000,000. In addition to clinical expertise, provincial psychiatric hospitals contribute greatly to teaching and research. Ontario's mental health reform movement has called for a shift of resources to the community and a downsizing of PPHs by 2003. In response to fiscal pressures, in 1996 provincial legislation was passed to establish the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) as a stand-alone corporation with powers to restructure and reengineer health services in Ontario. The HSRC has to date recommended the closure of 4 PPHs by 1999 and the integration of theses services into other medical facilities. While a rebalancing of the mental health system does need to take place, the fiscally driven haste to close hospitals has created a crisis atmosphere in PPHs for staff and patients. It is also unlikely that the necessary community resources will be in place to buffer these changes. The new restructuring plans not only set unrealistic timelines, they seem to underestimate the importance PPHs have played in teaching, research and the advancement of clinical treatment and rehabilitation of the severely mentally ill. It may be that, in the long run, service integration and divestment/closure of the PPHs will result in better access to services closer to smaller communities and in the destigmatization of the mentally ill, however, without close evaluative monitoring and appropriate leadership, it could also lead to decreased research, training and quality of care.

TI  - Lipopolysaccharide and ceramide use divergent signaling pathways to induce cell death in murine macrophages.  
AB  - Ceramide is a well-known apoptotic agent that has been implicated in LPS signaling. Therefore, we examined whether LPS-induced macrophage cytotoxicity is mediated by mimicking ceramide. Both LPS and the cell-permeable ceramide analogue, C2 ceramide, induced significant cell death in IFN-gamma-activated, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages after 48 and 24 h, respectively. Ceramide-induced cell death was neither accompanied by DNA fragmentation nor phosphatidyl serine externalization, characteristics of apoptosis. In contrast, LPS induced a significant fraction of cells to undergo apoptosis, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation and quantified by DNA analysis on FACS, yet the majority of the cells died in a necrotic fashion. C3H/HeJ Lps(d) macrophages were resistant to LPS-induced cell death and less sensitive to C2 ceramide-evoked cytotoxicity, when compared with Lps(n) macrophages. C2 ceramide plus IFN-gamma failed to activate release of nitric oxide (NO.), whereas LPS-induced cell death, but not C2-induced cytotoxicity, was blocked by an inhibitor of inducible NO. synthase (iNOS), NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Macrophages from IFN regulatory factor-1 (-/-) mice shown previously to respond marginally to LPS plus IFN-gamma to express iNOS mRNA and NO., were refractory to LPS plus IFN-gamma-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These data suggest that although LPS may mimic certain ceramide effects, signal transduction events that lead to cytotoxicity, as well as the downstream mediators, diverge.

TI  - [Effect of cadmium sulfate and strontium chloride on the glycogen content in hepatocytes of rats of various ages]  
AB  - Cytophotometry and image analysis being used, hepatocyte glycogen contents were measured in periportal and pericentral zones of liver lobules at different stages (1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days) of postnatal development of both intact rats and rats exposed to chronic CdSO4 (1 mg/kg body weight) and SrSO4 (6.5 mg/kg body weight) intoxication. The glycogen content in hepatocytes of intact rats increased continuously in the course of development being most highest at the initial stage of development. The glycogen content ratio in cells of portal and central zones of liver lobules varied during ontogenesis. The maximum value of this ratio is reached on the 21st day after the rat birth, dropping sharply at later age to reach its minimum in adults. Intoxication of rats by Cd2+ and Sr2+ within 1-90 days interval reduced hepatocyte glycogen levels, compared to normal liver. The prolongation of rat treatment with heavy metals for 90-365 days led to glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes. Rat intoxication with heavy metals for 1 year brought about the increase in both glycogen content per cell and glycogen concentration. Cd2+ treatment for 30-90 days resulted in glycogen accumulation inhibition in both the investigated zones of liver lobules. Thereafter an increased glycogen accumulation took place in hepatocytes of the portal and central liver lobules. Following Cd2+ treatment, the value of the ratios of glycogen levels in the portal and central liver lobules was lower than in the normal liver on all stages of the postnatal rat development. The lowest value (< 1.0) of this ratio was reached in the cirrhotic liver. Distinct from Cd2+ treatment of rats, the treatment with Sr2+ does not lead to significant changes in glycogen levels in cells of different zones of liver lobules. Nevertheless certain destructive changes in glycogen-forming function of hepatocytes after Sr2+ treatment are apparent. This is suggested from the lower glycogen levels in the portal and central zones of liver lobules on 30-180 days interval compared to the normal liver. Besides, the values of ratios in glycogen levels in the portal and central zones of liver lobules in 14 and 21 days old rats was noticeably lower than in the intact rats of the same age.

TI  - [Trends in lead exposure in the work place and the environment]  
AB  - In the last two decades, mainly because of the introduction of directives for reducing lead in gasoline, blood lead levels (PbB) in the general adult population decreased progressively to reach, at present, values ranging between 5 and 10 micrograms/100 ml. In the last decades, owing to technological and environmental improvements, the occupational exposure to lead dropped as well. At present, in industrial sectors in which Pb is largely utilised (accumulators and ceramics), mean PbE values range between 25 and 35 micrograms/100 ml. At present, the risk of increased lead absorption is higher for workers employed in specific activities (lead recovery, repairing of radiators, bronze and copper foundries) and in small factories in which environmental or preventive measures are inefficent. More attention must be paid to preventive measures in activities at higher risk, but also the current action level and limit in Italy (Decreto Legislativo 277/91), 35 micrograms/100 ml and 70 micrograms/100 ml, respectively, should be modified taking into account the changes in the working conditions. In addition, the reference levels for the general population set out in Directive 77/312/EEC appear to be too high and should be reviewed.

TI  - [The problem of lead exposure in the Piedmont: from the workplace to the general environment]  
AB  - In the first part of this study, the most frequently professional lead exposure observed since 1984 at the Occupational Health Clinic of Turin University are summarized and compared with exposure observed in the past. The second part analyzes the present blood lead levels in the general (non-occupationally exposed) population observed in a screening campaign carried out in Piedmont in 1993-94 within the framework of the national programme by biology surveillance prescribed by Presidential Decree no. 496 of 1982. Results agree with literature data and show a reduction in blood lead levels markedly below the Italian legal limits. Nevertheless, lead pollution in non-exposed subjects still represents a major hygienistic problem, because a relevant number of children have blood lead concentrations above 10 micrograms/ 100 ml, which is considered a safe level for avoiding irreversible injury to nervous system.

TI  - [Update on the subject of lead toxicology]  
AB  - In the past 10-15 years increasing attention has been paid to subclinical effects and to early or subtle health effects induced by lead (Pb) exposure. They form a continuum with classical clinical effects differing from them only for their degree. Accurate knowledge has been acquired on the effects of low level Pb exposure, especially concerning the effects on the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the endocrine and immune system, on heme containing enzymes, and on reproductive function. The question of a possible mutagenic and carcinogenic action of Pb on humans is still open. Many of the above mentioned effects have been observed for blood lead (PbB) levels below the current limits proposed for workers and the general population. In addition, for certain effects, like those on heme, central nervous system, and blood pressure, it has not been possible to establish a clear threshold value. A critical evaluation of the current prevention models appears to be appropriate to eliminate the dose-dependent effects occurring in highly exposed groups and to reduce, as much as possible, the effects without threshold in the general population.

TI  - Lead concentration in the bones of the feral pigeons (Columba livia): sources of variation relating to body condition and death.  
AB  - This paper reports on lead concentrations in the tarsometatarsi of 84 individuals of adult feral pigeons Columba livia found dead or experimentally captured in Bratislava, Slovakia. The interrelationships between lead concentrations and time of death, place of death, body measurements, sex, condition, and plumage phenotype were investigated. Size and shape of pigeons was not correlated with bone lead contamination. Sex and plumage color and pattern were slightly associated with variation in bone lead levels, females and melanic (urban) phenotypes tending to have higher bone lead concentrations than males and blue-bar (wild) individuals. Birds with antibodies to chlamydiae did not contain significantly higher lead concentrations in the tarsometatarsi than birds without antibodies. Concentration of lead in tarsi was significantly higher in birds dying in winter, compared to birds dying at the end of summer. Chronic lead poisoning probably causes mortality in pigeons in winter. The natural stressor, cold weather, has the capability of exacerbating the effects of lead poisoning, and the mortality is due to lead exposure coupled with cold stress.

TI  - Mobilized plasma lead as an index of lead body burden and its relation to the heme-related indices.  
AB  - Plasma lead (Pb-P) from workers were distributed in two main fractions: a protein bound fraction and low molecular weight fractions.  Lead mobilized into plasma by CaEDTA was mainly observed in the low molecular weight fraction corresponding to lead disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (PbEDTA). The peak levels of Pb-P was attained around 1.5 and 2.5 hours after the start of CaEDTA injection. Pb-P and blood lead levels (Pb-B) at 2 h after the injection were 4.26 (+/- 2.84) and 0.96 (+/- 0.27) fold of the initial levels just before the injection. Pb-P concentrations at 2 hours after the start of CaEDTA injection (MPb-P) were well correlated (r = 0.740) with amounts of lead excreted in urine for 24 h thereafter (MPb-U). log MPb-P as well as log MPb-U were correlated with Pb-B (r = 0.765 and 0.817, respectively). Correlation coefficients of lead body burden (MPb-P or MPb-U) vs the logarithms of the effect indices (delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase, ALA in urine, coproporphyrin in urine, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin) were higher than the correlation coefficients of exposure indices (Pb-B or Pb-U) vs the logarithms of the effect indices. Thus the biological effect monitoring is significant and reliable for evaluating the functional components of lead body burden (MPb-P or MPb-U).

TI  - Uptake of lead by Pomphorhynchus laevis cystacanths in Gammarus pulex and immature worms in chub (Leuciscus cephalus).  
AB  - The uptake of lead by cystacanths of the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis in naturally infected amphipods, Gammarus pulex, and by immature parasites in experimentally infected fish, Leuciscus cephalus, was examined following 3-week experimental exposures (0.01 and 0.1 mg l(-1) Pb2+). Both G. pulex and the cystacanths of P. laevis accumulated lead but concentrations in the parasites were lower than in the host tissues at the low lead dose and significantly lower at the high dose. P. laevis from chub exposed to 0.01 mg l(-1) lead contained significantly more of the metal than the tissues of their host. Interestingly, there was an increase in the mean lead levels in the parasites from the control chubs which was concurrent with a decrease in host tissue concentrations. The results of this experimental study therefore confirm previous suggestions that heavy metals are predominantly accumulated by acanthocephalans inside the fish definitive host and not by cystacanths in the haemocoel of the amphipod intermediate host. The microhabitat of the parasite is therefore of primary importance rather than its developmental stage. Furthermore, metal concentrations in adult acanthocephalans will respond rapidly to changes in environmental exposure of their hosts.

TI  - Cytokine gene transduction into non-immunogeneic murine tumor cells.  
AB  - The effect of cytokine transduction on the tumorigenicity and immunogenicity of murine non-immunogeneic mammary carcinoma (4T1), acute myeloid leukemia (mAML) and partially immunogenic B-cell leukemia (BCL1) has been evaluated in syngeneic strains of mice. Transduction by retroviral vectors containing the genes for GM-CSF, IL-2 or IFN-gamma did not lead to a marked antitumor effect in 4T1 mammary tumor or BCL1. A reduced local tumor size was observed in mice inoculated with 4T1 cells transduced with both GM-CSF and IL-2 genes followed by an in vitro exposure to recombinant IFN-gamma, but survival was not prolonged. Tumorigenicity of mAML cells transduced with the gene coding for IFN-gamma was significantly reduced as manifested by prolonged survival of mice in comparison with animals inoculated with non-transduced mAML cells. Transduction by each of the aforementioned cytokines did not affect the immunogenicity of these tumor model cells. The results suggest that genetic modification of spontaneous and non-immunogenic experimental tumor models does not necessarily support direct utilization of cytokine gene therapy for clinical application. More effective methods have yet to be established in order to achieve an antitumor effect in spontaneous non-immunogenic malignancies.

TI  - The role of GABA-A and mitochondrial diazepam-binding inhibitor receptors on the effects of neurosteroids on food intake in mice.  
AB  - The present studies were undertaken to investigate the neuroactive steroidal modulation of feeding behavior and possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA-A) and mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptors (MDR) in food-deprived male mice. Allopregnanolone (0.5-2 mg/kg), a neurosteroid, progesterone (1-10 mg/kg), a neurosteroid precursor, and 4'-chlordiazepam (0.25-1 mg/kg), a specific high affinity MDR agonist, produced a dose-dependent hyperphagic effects. In contrast, neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (1-10 mg/kg) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1-10 mg/kg) produced a hypophagic effect, in a dose-dependent manner. The allopregnanolone-, progesterone- and 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic effect was blocked by picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a GABA-A chloride channel antagonist, but not by flumazenil (2 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist. The 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic effect was prevented by pretreatment with PK11195 (2 mg/kg), a selective partial MDR antagonist. The hypophagic effect of DHEAS (10 mg/kg) was reversed by dizocilpine (10 microg/kg), an NMDA receptor antagonist, but resistant to muscimol (0.1 mg/kg), a selective GABA-A receptor agonist. In contrast, the PS (10 mg/kg)-induced hypophagic response was resistant to dizocilpine, but sensitive to muscimol (0.1 mg/kg). Both the sulfated neurosteroids PS and DHEAS also reversed the hyperphagic effect of allopregnanolone. In addition, the BZD agonist triazolam (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) also produced a flumazenil- and picrotoxin-sensitive hyperphagic effects, thereby suggesting the changes in feeding behavior by neurosteroids represent GABA-A receptor mediated hyperphagic action. Although the possible antistress or anxiolytic actions of neurosteroids may confound the hyperphagia, behavioral effects observed were specific to food because the mice were adopted to the test environment and diet, and of a possible variation between various neurosteroids in the extent to which antistress or anxiolytic effect produced at hyperphagic doses. The hyperphagic effects of progesterone and 4'-chlordiazepam resembled that of neurosteroid allopregnanolone. Therefore, the effect of progesterone may be imputed to its metabolism to allopregnanolone, while the 4'-chlordiazepam-induced hyperphagic response is related to its MDR-stimulated neurosteroidogenesis and subsequent modulation of GABA-A receptors. The hypophagic response following DHEAS may, at least partly, involve an NMDA receptor mechanism. However, PS-induced hypophagia may be mediated by GABA-A or other receptor systems. These data suggest a pivotal role for GABA-A and mitochondrial DBI receptors in the hyperphagic effects of neurosteroids and reinforces a role for endogenous neurosteroids in regulating feeding behavior. Future studies may lead to the development of neurosteroid-based anorectic/hyperphagic agents for therapeutic use.

TI  - Intermittent claudication. Conservative treatment, endovascular repair or open surgery for femoropopliteal disease.  
AB  - Intermittent claudication (IC) has a prevalence of 5-10% in the population above 70 years old. 50-75% remains stable without treatment, and the amputation risk is approximately 1% a year. The most important risk factor is smoking, and cessation can lead to an improvement of 50% in walking distance. An exercise program for 3 to 6 months is associated with a significant improvement in walking distance in the order of 100% in the majority of patients. Also pharmacological treatment and weight loss can be of benefit. Endovascular repair in the femoropopliteal segment is associated with a high initial success rate of 90%, in case of lesions shorter than 5-10 cm. The long-term success is in accordance with the results after conservative treatment, with improvement in 50-60% of the patients. Infrainguinal bypass surgery has an initial success rate near to 90%, and a favourable long-term patency of 50-80%. Vein should be preferred in the below knee bypass. The surgical treatment carries an early mortality of 1% and an amputation rate similar to the untreated patients. In the treatment of IC, conservative treatment with cessation of smoking, physical exercise and risk reduction still is the method of choice. In selected cases with suitable lesions, PTA is a minimal invasive method, with a high short-term success rate, acceptable long-term success and low morbidity. In cases of disabling claudication, with a severe influence on working ability and/or social life, PTA or surgery should be offered to the well-informed patient, who is accepting the risks associated. Further refinement of the available methods, including enhancements in medical treatment, will undoubtedly in the future lead to a more active approach towards treatment of intermittent claudication.

TI  - Management of hormone refractory prostate cancer: current standards and future prospects [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent advances in the biology and treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer are reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE literature search of secondary hormonal therapy and chemotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer was performed. Recent advances in the biology of hormone refractory prostate cancer, changes in the measurement of response to therapy, and testing of new drugs and combinations of drugs were reviewed. RESULTS: Historically the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer has been disappointing. Useful parameters to monitor clinical response have been lacking but perhaps more importantly a scarcity of apparently active drugs has contributed to these results. Recently several developments have improved the outlook for treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Recognition of antiandrogen withdrawal responses has had important ramifications for clinical trial interpretation and patient care. Secondary hormonal therapies, such as alternative antiandrogens and anti-adrenal agents, are well tolerated and can provide significant clinical benefits. Combining prostate specific antigen values with quality of life and measurable disease responses has made clinical trial end points more objective and more clinically relevant for the patient. Furthermore, a better understanding of the biology of hormone refractory prostate cancer, refinements in measuring response to treatment and availability of agents with proved palliative capabilities and/or generating greater than 50% response have all lead to improvements in treatment management. In 2 randomized studies mitoxantrone in combination with steroids has demonstrated significant palliative benefit compared with steroids alone. In phase II studies more than half of patients respond to estramustine combinations with vinblastine, etoposide or paclitaxel. Other novel combinations and new drugs currently are being tested. CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances suggest that available therapies for hormone refractory prostate cancer can have a meaningful impact on the disease. Improving treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer remains an area of active investigation.

TI  - Selective vulnerability of dopaminergic systems to industrial chemicals: risk assessment of related neuroendocrine changes.  
AB  - Increased serum prolactin (PRL) is a common finding among subjects exposed to styrene, perchloroethylene, lead (Pb), and manganese (Mn) at levels below the current threshold limit values. On a group basis, abnormally high basal PRL shows a dose-related distribution among workers exposed to styrene, Pb, and Mn. On the basis of dose-response relationships, the benchmark doses (BMD) for styrene metabolites in urine, lead in blood (Pb-B), and Mn in urine (Mn-U), are 4 mg/g creatinine, 112 micrograms/L, and 0.3 microgram/L, respectively. Noteworthy, the BMD for Mn-U and Pb-B is well below the upper reference limit. A shift in the distribution but not in the prevalence of abnormally high values of serum PRL was observed among perchloroethylene-exposed dry cleaners, which makes interpretation in terms of risk difficult. The measurement of PRL thus provides opportunities for early identification of excess exposure to neurotoxic chemicals affecting dopaminergic control of pituitary secretion. For styrene, Pb, and Mn the BMD provides an objective and statistically determined threshold, which seems to be in good agreement with the estimated no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). The NOAEL, however, is based on traditional approaches that require the application of uncertainty factors, e.g., a default factor of 10 when extrapolating the NOAEL from the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL). Due to its sensitivity to a number of potential confounders, caution must be exercised when using PRL as a screening test at the individual level. Also, age and sex dependent variations in susceptibility may hamper extrapolations from the occupational settings to the general population.

TI  - Lead content in edible wild mushrooms in northwest Spain as indicator of environmental contamination.  
AB  - Lead content was determined in wild growing mushrooms collected from two different areas in the Province of Lugo (NW Spain). It has been analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry in 95 samples of 13 species (7 mycorrhizals and 6 saprophites). In an assessment of lead concentrations, the following factors have been considered: species and ecology, morphological portion, and traffic pollution.  The average lead concentration of the samples was 1 ppm dry weight (dw). Saprophite species presented higher levels than mycorrhizal ones (< 1 ppm), Coprinus comatus reaching the maximum mean concentration with 2.06 and 2.79 ppm of dw in the hymenophore and the rest of the fruit body. Morphological portion, statistically, did not show significant difference between the two portions; however, Macrolepiota procera always presented lead high levels in the hymenophore in all samples. The effect due to traffic pollution has been specially observed in Coprinus comatus, presenting the highest concentration with values of 6.51 and 10.43 ppm, respectively, in samples collected in the city center. This species, as other researchers have indicated, could be considered as an indicator by lead contamination. The contribution of mushrooms to the weekly intake of lead was calculated and the possible health risk for the consumer is pointed out. These data are of great importance in view of toxicology and partly environmental protection.
