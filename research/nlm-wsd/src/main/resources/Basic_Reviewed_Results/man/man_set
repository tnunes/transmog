TI  - Rates of proximal and distal glycosylation of luteinizing hormone by cultured rat pituitary cells.  
AB  - The purpose of the present work was to study the rate of basal luteinizing hormone (LH) glycosylation, discriminating the co-translational (proximal) and the post-translational (distal) glycosylation. The experiments were performed to determine the temporal relationship between the biosynthesis of the peptide chains (by [14C]leucine incorporation: [14C]Leu-LH) and the proximal (by [3H]mannose incorporation: [3H]Man-LH) and distal (by [3H]galactose incorporation: [3H]Gal-LH) glycosylation of LH, by rat pituitary cells in primary culture. In addition, the effects of cycloheximide (translation inhibitor) and tunicamycin (glycosylation inhibitor) on the rates of synthesis and release of [3H]Man-LH and [3H]Gal-LH were studied. The rates of synthesis and release (between 0 and 2 h and between 2 and 5 h) were calculated by regression analysis and the statistical significance of differences was determined by the slope test. The rate of synthesis of [3H]Man-LH (slope = 45.59) parallelled that of [14C]Leu-LH (slope = 41.39), which was in agreement with the assumption that the addition of the high mannose core is a co-translational event. Release of [3H]Man-LH (slope = 4.32) as well as that of [14C]Leu-LH (slope = 2.53) showed a lag period of approximately 2 h. The dynamics of [3H]Gal-LH secretion over the course of incubation, with a slower rate of synthesis (slope = 26.40) and a faster rate of release (slope = 6.34), differed from that of [3H]Man-LH. LH labeled with [3H]Gal was released from the early times of the incubation, indicating that galactose is added in the final stages of the secretory process into LH molecules, which are immediately released. LH translation blockage induced by cycloheximide was associated with a corresponding decrease of [3H]Man incorporation. On the other hand, addition of tunicamycin to the pituitary cells inhibited the rates of synthesis and release of [3H]Man-LH, without affecting those of [14C]Leu-LH. These findings show that proximal glycosylation depends on synthesis of the peptide chains, whereas the addition of the polymannose core is not a condition for translation. The rates of synthesis and release of [3H]Gal-LH were less affected by the antibiotics, and the inhibition was only significant at higher doses and long-time treatments. The present results demonstrate the independence of both steps of LH glycosylation, the rate of [3H]Gal-LH synthesis being 1.7-fold slower and that of release 1.5-fold faster than those of [3H]Man-LH, respectively. The data also suggest that glycosylation is not an essential step in the LH secretory process since the hormone, which is normally secreted in a glycosylated form, was synthesized, transported, and released without the carbohydrate side chains.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic studies of the herbicide and antitumor compound oryzalin in mice.  
AB  - Oryzalin [3,5-dinitro-N,N-di(n-propyl)benzensulfanilamide] is a widely used sulfonamide herbicide that selectively inhibits microtubule formation in algae and higher plants. Oryzalin has also been found to be an inhibitor of intracellular free Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells and to have antitumor activity in animals. Despite its widespread use there have been no reports of the pharmacokinetics of oryzalin in animals or man. A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed to measure oryzalin in biological fluids. Following repeated daily administration of oryzalin to mice by the i.p. route at 200 mg/kg, or the p.o. route at 300 mg/kg, peak plasma concentrations of up to 25 micrograms/ml were achieved. The half life for oryzalin in plasma of mice given i.p. oryzalin was 14.3 h with a clearance of 0.07 l/h. A major metabolite of oryzalin, N-depropyloryzalin, was identified in plasma and its structure confirmed by mass spectral analysis (M+H+ = 305). This metabolite was cleared more rapidly than oryzalin with a half life of 1.15 h and a clearance of 0.17 l/h. N-Depropyloryzalin caused similar inhibition of colony formation by HT-29 colon cancer cells as oryzalin with IC50 = 8 micrograms/ml. The results suggest that oryzalin and its N-depropyl metabolite can inhibit tumor colony formation at pharmacologically achievable levels.

TI  - NMR and stable isotope techniques for studies of liver metabolism in man.  
AB  - The pivotal role of the liver for glucose homeostasis resides within its ability to store large amounts of glucose in the form of glycogen, but also to rapidly release glucose into the circulation (1,2). Despite extensive studies on liver glycogen metabolism in vitro, studies in humans were limited to measurements of glycogen content by biopsy (3) before the introduction of in vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy for monitoring of hepatic glycogen in man (4).

TI  - Dictyostelium lysosomal proteins with different sugar modifications sort to functionally distinct compartments.  
AB  - Many Dictyostelium lysosomal enzymes contain mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) in their N-linked oligosaccharide chains. We have now characterized a new group of lysosomal proteins that contain N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) linked to serine residues. GlcNAc-1-P-containing proteins, which include papain-like cysteine proteinases, cofractionate with the lysosomal markers and are in functional vesicles of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Immunoblots probed with reagents specific for each carbohydrate modification indicate that the lysosomal proteins are modified either by Man-6-P or GlcNAc-1-P, but not by both. Confocal microscopy shows that the two sets of proteins reside in physically and functionally distinct compartments. Vesicles with GlcNAc-1-P fuse with nascent bacteria-loaded phagosomes less than 3 minutes after ingestion, while those with Man-6-P do not participate in bacterial digestion until about 15 minutes after phagocytosis. Even though both types of vesicles fuse with phagosomes, GlcNAc-1-P- and Man-6-P-bearing proteins rarely colocalize. Since both lysosomal enzymes and their bound carbohydrate modifications are stable in lysosomes, a targeting or retrieval mechanism based on these carbohydrate modifications probably establishes and/or maintains segregation.

AB  - We experienced a successful treatment of acute myocardial infarction which was due to left main trunk obstruction.  A 54-year-old man with no history of angina was transported by a rescue squad in cardiogenic shock, and diagnosed by electrocardiography with a wide range of myocardial infarction. Emergent coronary arteriography was performed under IABP support, revealing 99% stenosis in the left main trunk. Percutaneous transluminal coronary recanalization (PTCR) was performed, but suddenly cardiac arrest was happened. He was put on emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS). A Palmaz-Schatz stent was implanted for reperfusion, but the patient was hemodynamically unstable with frequent ventricular arrhythmia and pulmonary edema. 24 hours later he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and CPB could be terminated intraoperatively. His cardiac function was very low and LVEF was 20%. All grafts were patent. On the rehabilitation he was discharged on postoperative day 162 and has returned to work in his office one year postoperatively.

AB  - We herein report a case of multiple colonic liver metastases treated with repeated percutaneous isolated liver chemoperfusion of cisplatin under hepatic venous isolation and charcoal hemoperfusion (HVI.CHP) as an inductive treatment. The patient was a 70-year-old man who underwent curative resections for metachronous rectal and descending colonic cancer in 1979 and 1995, respectively. During outpatient follow-up, he showed increases of serum CEA level. An abdominal CT study demonstrated multiple low-density lesions in the bilateral lobes of the liver, indicating colonic liver metastases. The patient had a total of 2 treatments with percutaneous isolated liver chemoperfusion of cisplatin (total dose, 500 mg) under HVI.CHP. His post-treatment course was uneventful without side effects, including leukopenia and renal dysfunction. Serum CEA levels showed a sharp decrease to 160 ng/ml 3 months after treatment from the pretreatment value of 1,064 ng/ml. CT scan 3 months after treatment revealed remarkable tumor regression along with liquefaction of liver tumors, showing a partial response. These results suggested that repeated percutaneous isolated liver chemoperfusion of cisplatin under HVI.CHP is a potent inductive treatment for patients with multiple colonic liver metastases.

TI  - Secretory profile of immunoreactive growth hormone-releasing hormone (IR-GHRH) during sleep in man and its clinical value.  
AB  - To clarify the role of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) in the regulation of the episodic growth hormone (GH) secretion which is known to occur constantly in the initial slow wave stage of nocturnal sleep in man, we studied the relation between the secretions of plasma immunoreactive(IR)-GHRH and GH while recording electroencephalograms. In subjects who showed a normal sleep pattern, the plasma IR-GHRH level increased 3- to 4-fold just before the surge of plasma GH, suggesting that GH release in the initial slow wave stage of sleep is mainly mediated by GHRH. However, when there was an apparent GH surge just before the onset of sleep, the magnitude of the GH response associated with the initial slow wave stage tended to be blunted, even when sufficient IR-GHRH was released. We also observed no appreciable fluctuations of plasma IR-GHRH during nocturnal sleep in a patient diagnosed as having GH-deficient dwarfism, suggesting the primary lesion was on the hypothalamus level, not the pituitary, in such a patient. In a case of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I with an ectopic (GHRH-producing pancreatic tumor, no remarkable elevation of plasma IR-GHRH was detected in the initial slow wave stage of nocturnal sleep. We conclude that the present study is significant not only in demonstrating the physiology of GHRH release, but also in establishing a safe, reliable and practical test for routine clinical use to investigate intrinsic ability to release GHRH and the primary lesions in patients with disorders of GH secretion.

TI  - [Delayed type allergic reaction to red azo dye in tattooing]  
AB  - Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare. In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments. While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.  A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos. Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found. Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin. The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative. In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.

TI  - Popliteal aneurysm presenting as acute thrombosis and ischemia in a middle-aged man with a history of Kawasaki disease.  
AB  - Kawasaki disease is known to cause a vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels, with subsequent aneurysm formation. Most of the severe manifestations of the disease occur as a result of coronary aneurysm formation. However, many other arteries have been documented to be involved. A case is presented of a middle-aged man with a history of Kawasaki disease who had an acute ischemic limb from a thrombosed popliteal aneurysm that formed as a result of the disease. This is the first known case report of Kawasaki disease resulting in delayed lower extremity ischemia. Typical findings of patients with Kawasaki disease are presented, along with a case report and review of the literature. A history of Kawasaki disease is an extremely rare but possible cause of peripheral aneurysms, even in middle-aged patients.

TI  - Metabolic and hemodynamic effects of peptide leukotriene C4 and D4 in man.  
AB  - The time course of the effects of intravenous or intracoronary administration of peptide leukotrienes on metabolic parameters and on systemic and coronary hemodynamics was evaluated in 15 patients with normal coronary arteries. Peptide leukotriene C4 (2 nmol given as a bolus intravenous injection) induced an early fall (at 2 min) in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.02) associated with a rise in heart rate (P < 0.001) and in plasma levels of epinephrine (P < 0.05) and norepinephrine (P < 0.005), but without significant changes in coronary blood flow or coronary vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine, and epinephrine returned to baseline values 10 min after leukotriene C4 administration. In contrast, at 10 min post leukotriene C4, with coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption unchanged, an increase in coronary vascular resistance (P < 0.05) and in myocardial oxygen extraction (P < 0.01) was observed, which returned to baseline values at 20 min post leukotriene C4. Peptide leukotriene D4 (3 nmol, given in the left coronary artery) induced an early (20 s) and transient fall in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001) paralleled by a rise in heart rate and plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, all of which returned to baseline at 10 min. Coronary vascular resistance increased at 10 and 15 min (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively) and myocardial oxygen extraction at 15 min (P < 0.02). These results suggest that small doses of peptide leukotrienes induce both an early and transient fall in mean arterial pressure associated with secondary sympathoadrenergic activation, and a late increase in small coronary arteriolar resistance.

TI  - Liver of the "visible man".  
AB  - Endoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive surgery, is presumed drastically to reduce postoperative morbidity and thus to offer both human and economic benefits. For the surgeon, however, this approach leads to a number of gestural challenges that require extensive training to be mastered. In order to replace experimentation on animals and patients, we developed a simulator for endoscopic surgery. To achieve this goal, a first step was to develop a working prototype, a "standard patient," on which the informatic and microengineering tools could be validated. We used the visible man dataset for this purpose. The external shape of the visible man's liver, his biliary passages, and his extrahepatic portal system turned out to be fully within the standard pattern of normal anatomy. Anatomic variations were observed in the intrahepatic right portal vein, the hepatic veins, and the arterial blood supply to the liver. Thus, the visible man dataset reveals itself to be well suited for the simulation of minimally invasive surgical operation such as endoscopic cholecystectomy.

PMID- 9370125
TI  - Shear stress, the endothelium and the balance between flow-induced contraction and dilation in animals and man.  
AB  - Dilation is the most commonly observed diameter change in blood vessels when intraluminal flow increases. However, at very high and low levels of vascular tone the response is constriction. This complex response seems designed to ensure that time-averaged vascular tone levels are restricted to an intermediate range. Flow dilation is initiated predominantly at the surface of the endothelium, probably by conformational change in macromolecules of the extracellular matrix such as glycosaminoglycans. This is associated with changes in ion binding--flow is exquisitely sodium sensitive, and subsequent alteration in cellular function. In the rabbit basilar artery the inward rectifying potassium channel of the endothelium cell is opened by shear stress increase leading to dilation and the voltage-dependent calcium channel of the smooth muscle cells with constriction. In this blood vessel, at any rate, the final response to flow change seems to be predominantly the consequence of the interaction between these two processes.

TI  - The evolutionary design of error-rates, and the fast fixation enigma.  
AB  - Genetic and non-genetic error-rates are analyzed in parallel for a lower and a higher organism (E. coli and man, respectively). From the comparison of mutation with fixation rates, contrasting proposals are made, concerning the arrangement of error-rates in the two organisms. In E. coli, reproduction is very conservative, but genetic variability is high within populations. Most mutations are discarded by selection, yet single mutational variants of a gene have, on average, little impact on fitness.  In man, the mutation rate per generation is high, the variability generated in the population is comparatively low, and most mutations are fixed by drift rather than selection. The variants of a gene are in general more deleterious than in E. coli. There is a discrepancy in the published mutation rates: the rate of mutation fixations in human populations is twice or four times higher than the individual rate of mutation production, a feature which is not consistent with current population genetics models. Two, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses may explain this 'fast fixation enigma': (i) Mutation rates have substantially decreased in recent human evolution and (ii) A substantial fraction of the fixed mutations were generated in a process-such as gene conversion-that violates the principle of independence of mutation events.

AB  - This study was designed to assess the effect of paraquat on the rat kidney. The experimental animals used were Wistar rats, a strain selected and maintained at the Institut d'hygiene alimentaire. Their diet was well defined and their state of health monitored. Female animals with mean weight of 200 g were used in this study. Doses of 20, 30 and 50 mg/kg were administered via the gastrointestinal route. In this experimentation, performed on 12 rats plus 3 controls, the dose considered to be sublethal was 30 mg/kg administered by gavage. These animals were sacrificed after 24 h, 48 h, 4, 8, 15, 30 and 60 day, selecting those animals with the most severely altered state, at each time. Tubular lesions started to appear by the 24th hour; the proximal tubule was the most sensitive. Lesions of the distal tubule were observed slightly later, from the 48th hour. Lesions became more intense from the 4th day onwards and reached a maximum on the 8th day. The first signs of repair of the proximal tubule and distal tubule were observed on the 15th day, but were less marked for the proximal tubule. This repair was slow and progressive. Persistent lesions of the proximal or distal tubules were still observed after two months. The glomeruli presented several alterations, which were always only moderate. Overall, paraquat induces serious life-threatening lesions of acute tubular necrosis in the absence of adequate intensive care.

AB  -  A 22-year-old Nepali man presented with a 2-month history of fever, ill health, anorexia, loss of weight and diarrhoea. Apart from an ill-defined lower abdominal mass, physical examination was unremarkable. Investigations showed the picture of malabsorption syndrome with no evidence of structural gastro-intestinal tract involvement on barium meal, small bowel and large bowel enema, upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy and mucous membrane biopsy. Laparoscopy showed typical features of tuberculous peritonitis. Liver biopsy showed tuberculous granulomatous hepatitis, and peritoneal biopsy showed caseating granulomata. The patient responded rapidly to antituberculosis chemotherapy.

TI  - Human minisatellite MS32 (D1S8) displays somatic but not germline instability in transgenic mice.  
AB  - Human minisatellite MS32 (D1S8) shows instability both in the germline and, at much lower levels, in somatic DNA. To investigate factors that influence somatic and germline mutation, large cosmid-based constructs containing MS32 were introduced into mice, bred to homozygosity and tested for instability in blood and sperm. Analysis of single copy and multicopy transgenic lines revealed somatic mutants occurring at a frequency comparable with that seen in man. As in humans, these mutants arose mainly by simple intra-allelic duplications and deletions. In contrast, analysis of sperm DNA from four different transgenic lines showed no trace of the complex recombination-based germline instability seen in man, even using PCR-based approaches capable of detecting very rare mutants. These data provide further evidence that germline and somatic mutation at human minisatellite MS32 occur via distinct pathways, that a major barrier exists to the transfer of germline instability from humans to mice and that the mouse germline appears to be protected from mitotic instability of the type seen in blood.

AB  -  A 35-year-old nephrotic man developed acute renal failure with serum creatinine to 1543 micromol/l after a month of therapy with enalapril. Renal biopsy demonstrated minimal glomerular changes with fusion of podocytes, tubular necrosis with regeneration of tubular epithelial cells, interstitial edema with focal interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial infiltration with neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells and mononuclear cells. Three hemodialyses were performed in the patient during the oliguric phase of the disease. Renal function was restored after withdrawal of enalapril and initiation of steroid therapy. Steroids also contributed to the improvement of the nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria decreased from maximal ranges of 27 g/l to 2.2 g/l after six months of the follow-up. Similar cases were previously described associated with captopril treatment, but not with enalapril.

TI  - Demonstration of nitric oxide on asbestos and silicon carbide fibers with a new ultraviolet spectrophotometric assay.  
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) has a number of important functions in biological systems and may play a role in the toxicity of mineral fibers. We investigated whether NO might be present on the surface of mineral fibers and if crocidolite could adsorb NO from NO gas or cigarette smoke. NO was determined with a new gas chromatography-ultraviolet spectrophotometric technique after thermal desorption from the fiber surface and injection in a gas flow cell. NO was found in different amounts on chrysotile B, crocidolite, amosite, and silicon carbide whiskers. There was a strong correlation between the amount of NO and the specific surface area of these fibers (r = 0.98). NO could not be demonstrated on rockwool fibers [man-made vitreous fiber(s) (MMVF)21 and MMVF22] or silicon nitride whiskers. NO on crocidolite, amosite, and silicon carbide whiskers was readily desorbed from the fibers at increased temperature, while NO on chrysotile B seemed to be more firmly adsorbed to the fiber and required a longer period of time to be desorbed. The amount of NO bound to crocidolite increased from 34 micrograms/g fiber to 85 and 474 micrograms/g after exposing the fibers to cigarette smoke and NO gas, respectively. These findings indicate that a) NO adsorbs to fiber surfaces, b) some fibers adsorb more NO than others, c) some fibers adsorb NO more strongly than others, and d) the amounts of NO on fibers may be increased after exposure of the fiber to cigarette smoke or other sources of NO. The biological significance of NO on mineral fibers remains to be investigated.

TI  - Approaches to characterizing human health risks of exposure to fibers.  
AB  - Naturally occurring and man-made (synthetic) fibers of respirable sizes are substances that have been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) as priority substances for risk reduction and pollution prevention under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The health concern for respirable fibers is based on the link of occupational asbestos exposure and environmental erionite fiber exposure to the development of chronic respiratory diseases, including interstitial lung fibrosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma in humans. There is also considerable laboratory evidence indicating that a variety of fibers of varying physical and chemical characteristics can elicit fibrogenic and carcinogenic effects in animals under certain exposure conditions. This paper discusses key scientific issues and major default assumptions and uncertainties pertaining to the risk assessment of inhaled fibers. This is followed by a description of the types of assessment performed by the U.S. EPA to support risk management actions of new fibers and existing fibers under TSCA. The scope and depth of these risk assessments, however, vary greatly depending on whether the substance under review is an existing or a new fiber, the purpose of the assessment, the availability of data, time, and resources, and the intended nature of regulatory action. In general, these risk assessments are of considerable uncertainty because health hazard and human exposure information is often incomplete for most fibers. Furthermore, how fibers cause diseases and what specific determinants are critical to fiber-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity are still not completely understood. Further research to improve our knowledge base in fiber toxicology and additional toxicity and exposure data gathering are needed to more accurately characterize the health risks of inhaled fibers.

TI  - Patterns and problems of adult total parenteral nutrition use in US academic medical centers [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use in US academic medical centers because TPN in adults may be associated with complications related to excessive glucose (dextrose) administration and a respiratory quotient greater than 1.0. DESIGN: Two surveys of the University HealthSystems Consortium (n = 106, 74 members and 32 network partners using TPN) to determine TPN formulas and amounts of TPN nutrients given to 2 hypothetical abdominal trauma patients (1 man and 1 woman), each of whom weighed 70 kg. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amounts of dextrose, amino acids, and fat and rates of administration of TPN. RESULTS: In the first survey, 80% (59/74) of members and 41% (13/32) of network partners of the University HealthSystems Consortium reported using TPN formulas with more than 20% dextrose; half used 25% dextrose. In the second survey, the mean (+/-SD) TPN dextrose concentrations were 190+/-43 and 170+/-45 g/L (902+/-204 and 807+/-214 mmol/L), with amino acid concentrations at 40 to 50 g/L, in the male and female patients, respectively. The amounts of amino acids and glucose given, when referred to body cell mass in the male and female patients, were equivalent. In 26% (22/86) of the institutions surveyed, the amounts of glucose given in TPN were high enough (>4.48 mg/kg per minute) to produce a respiratory quotient greater than 1.0. A standard TPN formula was derived as 4.25% amino acids, 15% dextrose, and 20% fat emulsion, at a rate to provide required calories. CONCLUSION: Excessive TPN glucose administration, found in at least one fourth of US academic medical centers, suggests use of a TPN formula with no more than 15% dextrose, administered at a rate to provide no more than 4 mg/kg of glucose per minute.

TI  - Influence of non-nutrient plant components on biotransformation enzymes.  
AB  - Plant foods contain numerous non-nutritive substances which exert biological activity. Most attention has been focused on the anticarcinogenic effects of these compounds. Many of the mechanisms involved include induction or inhibition of biotransformation enzymes. Each individual has its own isoenzyme pattern for the various drug-metabolizing enzymes. The multiplicity of these enzymes results in differential responses to dietary constituents. A substance may increase the level of a certain P450, and decrease the level of another. Although this complicates matters considerably, it also offers the possibility of specifically influencing biotransformation directed at a particular compound, e.g., a cytostatic agent. Using the important class of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) as an example, the various phenotypic and genetic origins of interindividual variation are described. Genetic variation is especially important for the mu and thetra class enzymes. The induction of individual isoenzymes of the GST has been studied in man rat. It was shown that the changes in the GST isoenzyme pattern induced by Brussels sprouts in rat liver and intestine were very similar to that caused by administration of ally isothiocyanate, and not to that resulting from goitrin.  In man Brussels sprouts led to induction of GST alpha only. A number of naturally occurring catechols, or more likely the quinones derived from them, are effective irreversible inhibitors of GST. Eugenol, for instance, lowers GST activity in man. A second class of compounds which shows promise are alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. A number of naturally occurring representatives of this class inhibit GST pi irreversibly, and ethacrynic acid, a drug with a similar reactive moiety in its structure, has already been shown to be quite useful to inhibit GST activity in cellular systems. Several approaches for future studies on the effects of dietary constituents are indicated: 1) further studies on the mechanisms of induction and inhibition of biotransformation enzymes: 2) careful studies using human volunteers, where the effects can be studied in isolation as much as possible; 3) studies of the disposition and kinetics of the dietary constituents themselves, to assess the relevance of inducing agents in food for the day-to-day human situation.

TI  - Effect of intraduodenal taurodeoxycholate and L-phenylalanine on pancreatic secretion and on gastroenteropancreatic peptide release in man.  
AB  - Intraduodenally applied bile salts and essential amino acids are known to stimulate exocrine pancreatic secretion. There are contradictory reports, however, about an interaction of both stimuli with respect to pancreatic function. The intention of the study was to compare the effects of equimolar amounts of taurodeoxycholate and L-phenylalanine used singularly and combined on pancreatic secretion and on gastroenteropancreatic peptide release. In 12 healthy subjects, 0.8 mmol of Na-taurodeoxycholate (410 mg) and L-phenylalanine (130 mg) were separately and combined applied into the duodenum in a randomized order. Volume, bicarbonate, trypsin, lipase, and amylase secretion as well as cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin plasma levels were measured. Volume and bicarbonate secretion was significantly enhanced by taurodeoxycholate. The effect was stronger compared to L-phenylalanine. The increase of enzyme secretion was comparable. After combined application, the ecbolic effect was insignificantly smaller, whereas the hydrokinetic effect was between those of the single stimuli. Plasma levels of cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin rose concomitantly with the pancreatic response. On an equimolar basis taurodeoxycholate results in a stronger hydrokinetic effect than L-phenylalanine. Their ecbolic effects, however, are comparable. In addition to cholinergic mechanisms, as indicated by the PP release observed, cholecystokinin may also act as a mediator. In combined application, the stimuli interfere with each other. Somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide are not responsible for this mutual inhibition.

TI  - Use of norethisterone and estradiol in mini doses as a contraceptive in the male. Efficacy studies in the adult male bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata).  
AB  - Administration of norethisterone (NET) or NET + estradiol benzoate using an Alzet minipump or as once-a-month intramuscular injection of their depot forms, NET-enanthate (NET-EN) and estradiol valerate (E-val), resulted in azoospermia in all monkeys (n = 13) within 60 to 150 days of treatment. Although addition of depot form of testosterone (T, 20 mg/month) to the regimen restored the behavioral response typical of a normal male, it did not reverse the azoospermic state. Serum T (heightened nocturnal) levels were significantly reduced (> 85%, p < 0.001) in all the treated groups. Evidence for blockade in spermatogenesis following treatment was obtained by DNA flow cytometry. Following withdrawal of treatment, the T level was restored to normalcy within 15 days but 120 days more were required for the animals to exhibit normal sperm counts. In conclusion, the efficacy of once-a-month injection of relatively low doses of NET-EN + E-Val to bring about azoospermia in monkeys, in a relatively short time, has been demonstrated. As the results are uniform and reproducible, it appears desirable that this steroid regimen be tested in man for its contraceptive efficacy.

METHOD: We performed magnetic resonance imaging of the brainstem of a 54-year-old man who had bilateral trochlear nerve palsy and mild truncal ataxia. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an arachnoid cyst of the quadrigeminal cistern with enlargement of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. The tectum of the midbrain and the ambient and interpeduncular cisterns were markedly compressed by the arachnoid cyst. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the bilateral trochlear nerve palsy in this patient was caused by the arachnoid cyst of the quadrigeminal cistern.

TI  - [Anatomic and functional features of venous valves]  
AB  - The comparison of the venous system in the human organism, and in particular the venous valves of the lower limbs, with studies conducted in animal models helped us to understand better the mechanisms involved in adapting to the upright position and walking. We examined work conducted in several species from the horse to the dog, especially in animals who often take on an upright position such as the chimpanzee and the kangouroo, in search for structures comparable to those in man. Different types of valves can be described in man: flotting valves (bicuspid, pigeon nest valves); reinforced valves (mid-thigh); reinforcing valves (periarticular zone in the knee); finally, "flat" valves which are highly resistant formations but with little anti-back flow action. We also describe valvular structures with muscle cells found in the plantar aspect of the foot and the veins of the quadriceps muscle, these valves may have an active hematopropulsive action (Bassi). These results allowed us to identify certain common points between the structures observed in the posterior legs of certain animals and to propose models for investigating venous diseases.

TI  - [Temporary antibiotic-loaded cemented prosthesis for two-stage septic hip arthroplasty]  
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: During the excision period of a two-stage revision arthroplasty, the hip has a low function and an unacceptable leg length discrepancy. The goal of this study was to expose technical details in order to perform a simple articulated cement spacer which could be implanted during this period to improve hip function, to authorize partial weight bearing and to avoid leg length discrepancy. MATERIAL: This method was applied in three two-stage procedures justified because of particular immunodeficiency conditions: a 43 years old man who had bone marrow allograft and immunosuppressive therapy because of leukemia suffering of subacute septic hip arthritis; a 58 years old man suffering of diabetes and active C-hepatitis who had a septic loosening of a total hip arthroplasty (THA); a 76 years old woman suffering of diabetes who had a third septic loosening of THA. METHOD: The prosthesis was made of antibiotic-impregnated cement according to organisms antibiotic resistance. The prosthetic junction between head and diaphysis was reinforced with a tibial plate. Prosthetic shape was identical to the one of femoral broaches inserted in the femur after prosthetic and cement removal. The broach size was chosen when mechanical stability in the femur was obtained, and avoided leg length discrepancy after trials with cups. The tibial plate was bent in order to reinforce the junction with regard to the shape of the determined broach. Two doses of antibiotic-impregnated cement were mixed and molded with hands, then the plate was incorporated at the appropriate location, finally the broach was applied on this composite and cement in excess was removed before polymerisation. For prosthetic head, two options were available: to mold the cephalic zone of the cement at the patient acetabulum diameter with a soft aluminium cup previously molded in the acetabulum; to mold the cement cephalic zone with a trial cup in order to obtain a 22 or 28 ball. For this last option, a third dose of antibiotic-impregnated cement was prepared and placed in the acetabulum, a trial femoral head was applied in it to mold the location for the 22 or 28 prosthetic head. Before insertion, a collar was applied on the stem to prevent migration. Active mobilization was encouraged, and partial weight-bearing authorized. RESULTS: The mean range of hip flexion during period was 60 degrees. The patients were discharged approximatively 12 days after the first stage. Two patients had effective painless partial weight-bearing. The second stage was performed six weeks later on the average. The second procedure was easier than the second stage of a conventional two-stage procedure because of: easy and low hemorrhagic dissection authorized by the prosthesis; low difficulties with soft tissue tension as the prosthesis prevents leg length discrepancy; preservation of the articular space which prevents soft tissue sacrifice during the second stage. CONCLUSION: This simple technique is effective to prevent complications related to the excision period of a two-stage hip revision arthroplasty. Likewise, the economical aspect (short delay of hospitalisation, quick functional recovery) should be considered when compared with the excision period of a conventional two-stage procedure.

TI  - Surgical drainage for idiopathic suppurative pylephlebitis.  
AB  - Idiopathic suppurative pylephlebitis is quite rare and only a few cases have been reported. Conservative systemic administration of antibiotics and urokinase is reported to be effective. In this report, surgical drainage was performed on an 18-year-old man who complained of fever and abdominal pain. He had no past history of abdominal inflammatory disease or abdominal surgery. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed wide spread thrombosis of the portal vein. Laparotomy was performed and the occluded superior mesenteric vein was incised. Massive pus was removed. Thereafter, a drain was placed at the opened mesenteric vein. Drainage resulted in a dramatic decrease in fever. Postoperative radiographic studies of the colon, the small intestine, and other organs did not show any abnormalities. Emergency surgical drainage was performed successfully, instead of systemic administration of antibiotics and urokinase. Surgical drainage may be useful for wide spread pylephlebitis and pylethrombosis.

TI  - Proposed changes in the classification of carcinogenic chemicals in the work area.  
AB  - Carcinogenic chemicals in the work area are currently classified into three categories in Section III of the German List of MAK and BAT Values. This classification is based on qualitative criteria and reflects essentially the weight of evidence available for judging the carcinogenic potential of the chemicals. It is proposed that these Categories--IIIA1, IIIA2, and IIIB--be retained as Categories 1, 2, and 3, to conform with EU regulations. On the basis of our advancing knowledge of reaction mechanisms and the potency of carcinogens, it is now proposed that these three categories be supplemented with two additional categories. The essential feature of substances classified in the new categories is that exposure to these chemicals does not convey a significant risk of cancer to man, provided that an appropriate exposure limit (MAK value) is observed. It is proposed that chemicals known to act typically by nongenotoxic mechanisms and for which information is available that allows evaluation of the effects of low-dose exposures be classified in Category 4. Genotoxic chemicals for which low carcinogenic potency can be expected on the basis of dose-response relationships and toxicokinetics and for which risk at low doses can be assessed will be classified in Category 5. The basis for a better differentiation of carcinogens is discussed, the new categories are defined, and possible criteria for classification are described. Examples for Category 4 (1,4-dioxane) and Category 5 (styrene) are presented. The proposed changes in classifying carcinogenic chemicals in the work area are presented for further discussion.

TI  - [Soil contamination with Toxocara sp. eggs in public parks and home gardens from Mexico City]  
AB  - Due to de high number of stray dogs and cats which defecate in public places in Mexico City (3 millions approximately), in addition to domestic dogs and cats, exists the potential risk to man of infection by Toxocara sp. eggs. A study to determine the contamination frequency by Toxocara sp. eggs in public parks, public flower beds, and home gardens in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, was carried out in the 1995 first semester. Fourteen hundred and five soil samples were collected from 156 public parks, 83 public flower beds and 42 home gardens across the 16 delegations in Mexico City, Distrito Federal. Samples were processed by the zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation method, and supernatants read by microscopy. Out of the whole 281 sampled sites, 12.5% were found contaminated with Toxocara sp. eggs. Positivity found was: 10.9% in public parks, 13.3% in public flower beds and 16.7% in home gardens. Ninety percent of the eggs were embryonated or larvaeted measuring 60 to 90 micrometers. The high contamination frequencies found make necessary to prompt for Public Health measures granted the risk of infection acquisition spread on the most exposed population (children) provided that it is acquired via geophagia.

TI  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus salivarius. Functional and biochemical characterization of IIABL(Man) and IIABH(Man).  
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus salivarius consists of a nonphosphorylated enzyme II domain that functions in tandem with a separate enzymatic complex called III(Man). The III(Man) complex is believed to be composed of two protein dimers with molecular masses of approximately 72 kDa. Analysis of these proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate has indicated that one dimer is composed of two 38.9-kDa subunits called IIIH(Man), and the other of two 35.2-kDa subunits called IIIL(Man). This study was undertaken to determine (1) the number and nature of the phosphorylated residue(s) on IIIH(Man) and IIIL(Man) and the phosphorylation sequence allowing the transfer of the phosphoryl group from HPr(His approximately P) to the mannose:PTS substrates; (2) whether IIIH(Man) and IIIL(Man) originate from two different genes or result from a posttranslational modification; and (3) whether these two proteins are involved in the phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose, a substrate of the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system. We showed that both IIIH(Man) and IIIL(Man) were phosphorylated on two histidine residues. One phosphate bond was heat-labile (phosphorylation at the N1 position of the imidazole ring), while the second was heat-resistant (phosphorylation at the N3 position of the imidazole ring). The sequence of the first phosphorylation site was deduced by comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequence of both forms of III(Man) with IIA domains of the EII-mannose family. The sequences of both forms were identical over the 15 first amino acids, that is, MIGIIIASHGKFAEG. The sequence of the second phosphorylation site was determined for IIIL(Man) as IHGQVATNxTP. Hence, IIIH(Man) and IIIL(Man) are PTS proteins of the IIAB type and should be renamed IIABH(Man) and IIABL(Man). IIABH(Man) and IIABL(Man) had different peptide profiles after digestion with proteases, indicating that these two proteins are encoded by two different genes. In vitro PEP-dependent phosphorylation assays conducted with a spontaneous mutant devoid of both forms of IIAB(Man) suggested that the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of S. salivarius is composed of an uncharacterized nonphosphorylated membrane component that works in tandem with IIABL(Man). The physiological functions of IIABH(Man) remain unknown.

TI  - The history of the Papanicolaou smear and the odyssey of George and Andromache Papanicolaou.  
AB  - The Papanicolaou smear, a routine screening test for cancer of the uterine cervix, was reported in 1928, and its efficacy was proved by 1941. Since then, it has been used worldwide as a clinical tool for the early detection of cancer. Cancer of the cervix follows a predictable sequence. Precancerous changes, not visible to the naked eye, are detected readily in cells sampled by the Papanicolaou smear. The evolution from the precancerous stage to cancer is slow, and routine annual screening makes this a curable cancer and totally preventable disease. This is the story of an ambitious and brilliant man, George Papanicolaou, and his devoted wife, Andromache Mavroyenous, whose discovery of the screening test is now recognized as the most significant advance in the control of cancer in the 20th century.

The Man-4 and Man-4' residues of the diantennary oligosaccharide exhibit a similar relaxation behavior, suggesting that the Man-4' branch occurs in a single conformation of the C5-C6 linkage of Man-3 instead of in rapidly interconverting conformations that are known to exist for this linkage for the free oligosaccharide.

TI  - Mobilities of the inner three core residues and the Man(alpha 1--6) branch of the glycan at Asn78 of the alpha-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin are restricted by the protein.  
AB  - Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone involved in the maintenance of the corpus luteum in early pregnancy. The free alpha-subunit of hCG has a biological activity of its own, namely, stimulation of prolactin secretion from term pregnancy decidual cells [Blithe, D. L., et al. (1991) Endocrinology 129, 2257-2259]. Glycosylation at Asn78 of the alpha-subunit is required for the stability of the protein, but the exact nature of the stabilizing effect is not known. In our previous study, it was indicated that GlcNAc-1 at Asn78 has a reduced mobility, whereas the glycan at Asn52 is highly mobile [De Beer, T., et al. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 241, 229-242]. In the present investigation, it is shown that the PNGase F susceptibility of the Asn52-linked glycan in the free alpha-subunit is absent in the heterodimer. Thus, the high mobility of the glycan at Asn52 may be characteristic for the free alpha-subunit. For accurate modeling of alpha hCG, knowledge of the behavior of each of the glycans is essential. In this context, the mobility of the glycans and their interactions with the protein are explored by NMR spectroscopy using desialylated, partially deglycosylated free alpha-subunit (as-pd alpha) carrying glycans at Asn78 only. NOEs between GlcNAc-2 and several amino acid residues indicate that GlcNAc-2 is involved in stabilizing alpha hCG. From the values of 13C relaxation parameters T2 and T1 rho of the constituting monosaccharide residues, it was concluded that the inner three residues have a severely restricted mobility. The Man-4 and Man-4' residues of the diantennary oligosaccharide exhibit a similar relaxation behavior, suggesting that the Man-4' branch occurs in a single conformation of the C5-C6 linkage of Man-3 instead of in rapidly interconverting conformations that are known to exist for this linkage for the free oligosaccharide.

TI  - Understanding ageing.  
AB  - A broad biological approach makes it possible to understand why ageing exists and also why different mammalian species have very different maximum longevities. The adult organism is maintained in a functional state by at least ten major mechanisms, which together comprise a substantial proportion of all biological processes. These maintenance mechanisms eventually fail, because the evolved physiological and anatomical design of higher animals is incompatible with continual survival. The lifespan of each mammalian species depends on the efficiency of maintenance of their cells, tissues and organisms, and there is much evidence that such maintenance is more effective in long-lived species, such as man, than in short-lived small mammals. It is also evident that there is an inverse relationship between reproductive potential and longevity, which would be expected if total metabolic resources are shared between investment in reproduction, and investment in the preservation of the adult body. It is proposed that the eventual failure of maintenance leads to the pathological changes seen in age-associated disease. Although we now have a biological understanding of the ageing process, much future research will be needed to uncover the cellular and molecular changes which give rise to age-associated diseases. The major aim of such research is to devise procedures to delay or prevent the onset of these diseases.

TI  - Cerebral amebiasis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  
AB  - Rare cases of cerebral amebiasis have been described in AIDS patients. We report the case of a 46 year-old homosexual man with AIDS who developed an intermittent amnesia and a right palpebral ptosis. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 169 cells (75% lymphocytes). The patient died five days after hospitalization. Necropsy revealed thrombosis of small vessels of the periventricular regions as well as necrosis and hemorrhage of the periventricular tissue, cerebellum and brainstem. The inflammatory process was scarce and composed mainly of CD-68 positive macrophages. In these regions as well as in meninges there were many trophozoites of ameba of the Acanthamoeba group. Although cerebral amebiasis is rare even in AIDS, the clinician should be attentive to this diagnosis in patients with an insidious encephalitis and cerebral cognitive abnormalities, with or without focal motor signs.

TI  - Renal papillary necrosis--40 years on.  
AB  - Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognized as a major class of therapeutic agent that causes renal papillary necrosis (RPN). Over the last decade a broad spectrum of other therapeutic agents and many chemicals have also been reported that have the potential to cause this lesion in animals and man. There is consensus that RPN is the primary lesion that can progress to cortical degeneration; and it is only at this stage that the lesion is easily diagnosed. In the absence of sensitive and selective noninvasive biomarkers of RPN there is still no clear indication of which compound, under what circumstances, has the greatest potential to cause this lesion in man. Attempts to mimic RPN in rodents using analgesics and NSAIDs have not provided robust models of the lesion. Thus, much of the research has concentrated on those compounds that cause an acute or subacute RPN as the basis by which to study the pathogenesis of the lesion. Based on the mechanistic understanding gleaned from these model compounds it has been possible to transpose an understanding of the underlying processes to the analgesics and NSAIDs. The mechanism of RPN is still controversial. There are data that support microvascular changes and local ischemic injury as the underlying cause. Alternatively, several model papillotoxins, some analgesics, and NSAIDs target selectively for the medullary interstitial cells, which is the earliest reported aberration, after which there are a series of degenerative processes affecting other renal cell types. Many papillotoxins have the potential to undergo prostaglandin hydroperoxidase-mediated metabolic activation, specifically in the renal medullary interstitial cells. These reactive intermediates, in the presence of large quantities of polyunsaturated lipid droplets, result in localized and selective injury of the medullary interstitial cells. These highly differentiated cells do not repair, and it is generally accepted that continuing insult to these cells will result in their progressive erosion. The loss of these cells is thought to be central to the degenerative cascade that affects the cortex. There is still a need to understand better the primary mechanism and the secondary consequences of RPN so that the risk of chemical agents in use and novel molecules can be fully assessed.

TI  - Traumatic lumbar pseudomeningocele occurring with spina bifida occulta.  
AB  - Pseudomeningocele in the lumbar spine due to spinal fractures or surgical procedures are well-recognized complications. We treated a 24-year-old man who fell from a horse, landing on his buttocks, and developed headaches, back pain, and a large lumbar subcutaneous fluid collection. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a midline defect in the sacral lamina and a large fluid collection in the subcutaneous space consistent with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). He was treated conservatively, his symptoms resolved, and follow-up MR imaging showed resolution of the CSF accumulation. To our knowledge, there have been no cases of traumatic pseudomeningocele related to spina bifida occulta reported in the literature. The authors postulate that congenital defects in the neural arch contribute to the occurrence of this entity, and nonsurgical treatment should be the initial course.

TI  - CD44 splice variants as prognostic markers in colorectal cancer.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Splice variants of CD44 play a causal role in the metastatic spread of pancreatic carcinoma in the rat. In previous studies we have shown that homologues of these CD44 isoforms (CD44v6) are overexpressed during colorectal tumorigenesis in man and that CD44v6 overexpression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in this disease. In the present study we have assessed the prognostic significance of CD44 variants containing exon v5. In addition, we have used a panel of different antibodies against CD44v6 and applied a combined scoring system to improve its value as prognosticator. METHODS: Expression of CD44 variants was studied by immunohistochemistry on frozen tissue sections, and the prognostic value of the CD44 variant expression was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Our studies show that expression of CD44v6, but not CD44v5, has significant prognostic value. Analysis of CD44v6 expression by means of a combined scoring system, on the basis of a panel of three different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), makes CD44v6 a highly significant prognostic marker that is independent of Dukes stage, tumor grade, or tumor localization. CONCLUSION: Assessment of CD44v6 expression by a combination of mAbs yields an independent prognosticator that may be of value in identifying patients with a high propensity to develop distant metastasis.

TI  - [An autopsy case of Goodpasture syndrome preceded with membranous glomerulonephritis]  
AB  - Goodpasture syndrome (GS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the association of pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The pathogenesis of GS is still unknown, but was shown to be the result that antibodies directed against glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens could injure both glomerular and pulmonary alveolar basement membrane. And membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is a glomerular disease characterized by epimembranous immune deposits and basement membrane thickening. MGN typically presents with the onset of nephrotic syndrome, but it often presents with only asymptomatic proteinuria. We reported an autopsy case of GS preceded with MGN.  A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute renal failure in May 2, 1996. Percutaneous renal biopsy demonstrated a crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with MGN and linear immunofluorescent staining of the basement membrane with antibodies to IgG. Two weeks later on admission he began to develop slight hemoptysis and chest X-ray showed pulmonary hemorrhage, Furthermore, his serum anti-GBM antibodies titer was very high. He was diagnosed as GS associated with MGN and treated with plasma exchange, glucocorticoid, and cyclophosphamide. Though his symptom was improved for intensive support, he suddenly died on June 22. Autopsied lungs showed focal pulmonary hemorrhage, but were not considered to be life-threatening. The cause of the death remained unclear.

AB  - We report herein the case of a 61-year-old man found to have a rare nonfunctional paraganglioma of the pancreas. Interestingly, the preoperative data and images showed similar characteristics to neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Both paragangliomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas belong to the category of Amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation (APUD) tumors (APUDomas). Thus, it is important to examine the serum level of pancreatic endocrine hormones and a variety of peptides to differentiate paragangliomas of the pancreas from other pancreatic tumors. Paragangliomas of the pancreas grow slowly, so radical resection is recommended to achieve curability with a good prognosis.

TI  - Recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase corrects acid alpha-glucosidase-deficient human fibroblasts, quail fibroblasts, and quail myoblasts.  
AB  - Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency causes Pompe disease, a lethal lysosomal glycogen storage disease for which no effective treatment currently exists. We investigated the endocytic process in deficient cells of human recombinant GAA produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the potential of GAA-deficient Japanese acid maltase-deficient quail as a model for evaluating the enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease. After 24-h incubation with a single dose of recombinant enzyme, intracellular GAA and glycogen levels in deficient human fibroblasts were normalized, and this correction lasted for 7 d. The 110-kD precursor recombinant enzyme was processed to the 76-kD mature form within 24 h after uptake. Intracellular GAA levels in deficient quail fibroblasts and myoblasts were similarly corrected to their average normal levels within 24 h. Differences existed in the efficiency of endocytosis among subfractions of the enzyme, and among different cell types. Fractions with a larger proportion of precursor GAA were endocytosed more efficiently. Quail fibroblasts required a higher dose, 4200 nmol.h-1.mL-1 to normalize intracellular GAA levels than human fibroblasts, 1290 nmol.h-1.mL-1, whereas primary quail myoblasts required 2800 nmol.h-1.mL-1. In all three cell lines, the endocytosed enzyme localized to the lysosomes on immunofluorescence staining, and the endocytosis was inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) added to the culture medium. Despite structural differences in Man-6-P receptors between birds and mammals, these studies illustrate that Man-6-P receptor mediated endocytosis is present in quail muscle cells, and demonstrate the potential of acid maltase-deficient quail to test receptor mediated enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease.

TI  - Improvement of age estimation using amino acid racemization in a case of pink teeth.  
AB  - Age was estimated from pink teeth using racemization of dentinal aspartic acid. Materials for identification were two lower second premolars. The body was determined to be that of a 40-year-old man; however, the age of the decedent had been estimated to be 29 and 30 years by the conventional method and 30 years from findings in the oral cavity. To clarify the cause of this difference, the powdered teeth were further washed in 0.01 mol/L hydrochloric acid. The racemization ratio (D/L ratio) of ordinary white teeth from persons of known age was slightly lower than that before washing, whereas that of the teeth used for identification was higher than before washing. The calculated age of the decedent using the racemization ratio of his teeth was between 36 and 37 years. These results suggest that age estimated from pink teeth is probably underestimated, but a more accurate age estimate can be obtained after adequate washing.

AB  - The case of a man who initially presented to an emergency room with an isolated dysarthria is reviewed in order to demonstrate how the history, clinical context, and clinical observations can lead to accurate or inaccurate diagnosis. The diagnostic process in this case illustrates (1) the value of experience in clinical practice; (2) the role of the history and clinical context in diagnosis, but their occasional capacity to mislead; (3) the importance of distinguishing evidence from inference; (4) the use of deductive strategies and pattern recognition in speech diagnosis; (5) the importance of diagnostic vigilance; (6) the value of distinguishing among dysarthria types; and (7) the contribution that the diagnosis of speech disorders can make to the localization and diagnosis of neurologic disease.

TI  - [Ascites due to hyperthyroidism]  
AB  -  A 77-year-old man presented with ascites which was due to hypothyroidism. After the ascites had been brought into remission by salt restriction, diuretics and paracentesis, monotherapy with levothyroxine prevented recurrence. Ascites reappeared as soon as levothyroxine was withdrawn due to the patient's non-compliance. Distinctive aspects of this type of ascites are the high concentration of total protein in the ascites and the high serum-to-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). The pathogenesis of ascites in hypothyroidism is unknown. Possible hypotheses include increased capillary permeability, obstruction to lymphatic flow caused by hyaluronic acid-albumin complexes, and diminished water diuresis due to excess antidiuretic hormone. A patient with unexplained ascites should be tested for hypothyroidism, especially when the SAAG is high (> 11 g/l).

AB  - We report a case of an atypical penile herpetic ulcer in a man with previously undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Swabs of the lesion were negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) by culture and electron microscopy. However, histopathology of biopsy material showed characteristic herpetic multinucleate giant cells. Immunochemistry using polyclonal antibodies was positive for HSV1 and HSV2. The lesion completely resolved after treatment with aciclovir and the patient subsequently tested positively for HIV antibodies.

TI  - Monoclonal origin of an esophageal carcinosarcoma producing granulocyte-colony stimulating factor: a case report.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcomas are comprised of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements, and their histogenesis remains unclear. The authors examined the serum concentrations of hematopoietic growth factors and performed immunohistochemical studies on an esophageal carcinosarcoma from a patient with marked granulocytosis to determine its histopathogenesis and clonality. METHODS: The authors examined the case of a 63-year-old man with a polypoid tumor of the esophagus associated with marked leukocytosis (131 x 10(9) per liter). Immunohistochemical staining of the esophageal tumor was performed using monoclonal antibodies against granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), keratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin. RESULTS: The patient's leukocyte count was increased (124 x 10(9) per liter) on admission. Because mature granulocytes predominantly were increased despite the absence of apparent infection, the patient's serum G-CSF concentration was examined and found to be 286.0 pg/mL and to increase with time. After thoracic esophagectomy was performed, granulocyte count and serum G-CSF concentration rapidly normalized. G-CSF concentration was 50-fold higher in the tumor tissue extract than in the extract from normal esophageal tissue. Microscopic examination of the resected specimens revealed that the tumor was comprised of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and spindle-shaped sarcomatous elements, and transitional features were observed within these two components. Immunohistochemical examination disclosed cells that were positive for keratin and EMA in the carcinomatous element and vimentin positive cells in the sarcomatous element. However, both types of tumor cells were positive for G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of G-CSF in both SCC cells and spindle-shaped sarcomatous cells indicated that these two components originated from a single clone.

TI  - Studies on the transmission potential of filariasis in controlled areas of Henan Province.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the regular pattern of growth and declination or the transmission potential of filariasis after the disease was basically (the microfilarial rate was lower than 1%) in Henan Province in 1987. METHODS: According to the distribution of filaria species and original microfilarial rate, in 7 surveillance sites in 7 counties (cities) the etiology and mosquito vector surveys were carried out continuously during 1988-1995 and no control measurement for pathogen was taken. RESULTS: Ten residual microfilaremias became negative gradually in the first 6 years and no new microfilaremias occurred during 1988-1995. During 1993 to 1995, the microfilaremias rate of population in the sites was 0. The natural infection rates of filarial larvae in vector mosquito were 0.1%-0. During the 8 years, 15 vector mosquitos were positive with a total of 18 filarial larvae which were all of first or second-stage larvae. The C. pipiens pallens was the main vector, the second was A. sinensis, with a small number of C. fatigans and A. anthropophagus. The man-biting rates of mosquitoes for outdoor sleepers fluctuated greatly, the highest one was 360.6 mosquitoes/person per night and the lowest, 7.2. The man-biting rates of mosquitoes for sleepers inside mosquito-net was about 1 mosquito/person per night. The proportion of multiparous mosquitoes also fluctuated more greatly, the highest one was 88.1% and the lowest 27. 2% According to the data described above, the man-biting rate of vector mosquito which contained filarial L3 was 0. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that after the microfilarial rate was lower than 1%, the residual microfilaremias became negative gradually in 3-6 years, and the transmission of the disease was blocked. Therefore, in the areas where filariasis was basically controlled, elimination of the disease was attainable within sight.

TI  - [Cervical actinomycosis. A rare differential diagnosis of parotid tumor]  
AB  - Actinomycosis is currently an uncommonly diagnosed human disease. However, it can still complicate trauma to the respiratory and digestive tracts, including operative procedures. A patient with cervicofacial actinomycosis commonly gives a history of recent dental manipulation which usually, involves extraction of a mandibular molar. The common initial symptoms of infection--such as, sudden onset of cervicofacial pain, swelling, erythema, edema and suppuration--can be absent. Infection due to actinomyces is a well-known mimic of malignancy is clinical, radiological and pathological findings. In the case described a 65-year-old man had a mass in his right parotid area. Because of its painless rapid growth with infiltration of the mandible as demonstrated by clinical findings and CT and MRI scans, we established an initial diagnosis of salivary gland malignancy. Salivary gland biopsy then revealed a histological picture of infection due to actinomyces. Therapy was initiated with intravenous amoxicillin and sulbactam. After 20 days of treatment diseased soft tissues and bone were resected. To prevent a relapse the patient received oral clindamycin for 6 weeks. After a followup of two years, the patient has remained free of disease.

AB  - From a three-year old boy in Hong Kong who died in May 1997 with an extensive influenza pneumonia an influenza A virus has been isolated which was, first at the National Influenza Centre of the Netherlands, identified as belonging to subtype H5N1. Presumably the patient had acquired the infection directly from an outbreak of fowl plague among chickens. As far as is known this is the first case of the isolation of an influenza virus belonging to one of the subtypes H4-H15 from a human influenza patient. At the end of 1997 seventeen more cases of human A (H5N1) influenza have been detected in Hong Kong, including five fatal cases. Genetic analyses of seven of these virus isolates did not reveal the occurrence of reassortment with a human or porcine influenza virus, which could have rendered the virus potentially pandemic.  Man-to-man transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated but cannot be excluded either. This event has shown that the WHO surveillance of influenza viruses, although perhaps not perfect, has functioned well.

AB  - Three endopolygalacturonases (endoPG Ia, Ib, and Ic) were isolated from the culture filtrate of Stereum purpureum, the causative fungus of apple silver-leaf disease. Their properties, including specific activities, optimum pHs, thermal stabilities, and kinetic parameters (K(m) and Vmax) were compared. Their properties were very similar to one another except for the substrate specificity and relative molecular mass. The sugar chains of endoPG Is were released by hydrazinolysis, and one major sugar chain common to endoPG Is was isolated. The pyridylamino sugar was characterized by a two-dimensional mapping method using HPLC, and identified as a high mannose type N-linked sugar chain, Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3) Man beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-4 GlcNAc (designated as M5.1). Observation of the course of Western blot analysis for the proteins from the culture filtrate with endoPG I antibodies showed that the fungus secreted three endoPG Is into the culture broth during the growing period.

AB  -  A 33-year-old HIV-infected man was given antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine and lamivudine. After ten months' treatment the patient had elevated hepatic transaminase levels. Severe hepatic steatosis was found in the biopsy. Clinical history, laboratory, microbiologic and X-ray examination revealed no other abnormalities. The transaminase levels remained high after withdrawal of zidovudine alone, but a decrease was observed when both zidovudine and lamivudine were stopped. Rechallenge of lamivudine therapy caused the levels to increase again. The hepatic steatosis was considered to be caused by the antiretroviral therapy, lamivudine having a synergistic influence on this side effect of zidovudine. Ten months after the therapy was changed to the protease inhibitor indinavir combined with zalcitabine and stavudine, two other nucleoside analogues, hepatic steatosis recurred.

TI  - The axillary tree as a source of musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps in a fixed-skin porcine model.  
AB  - Our understanding of muscle, fascia, and skin flap physiology is based largely on data obtained from rodent, rabbit, or canine models. The presence of a well-developed panniculus carnosus confounds the extrapolation of data from these animals to humans. This study attempted to define microsurgically applicable musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps in the pig that would be comparable to flaps commonly used in humans. Lead oxide was injected into each axillary artery of three standard white domestic swine. Gross dissection and radiographic studies were used to define the specific anatomic fasciocutaneous territory served by the branches of the circumflex scapular artery. Eight musculocutaneous flaps based on the thoracodorsal artery and eight fasciocutaneous flaps based on the circumflex scapular artery were elevated. Although all flaps survived in their entirety, the fasciocutaneous flaps did not, as in man, have an easily dissectable axial blood supply. This finding suggests that the porcine scapular fasciocutaneous flap, although reliable as a pedicled flap, is difficult to employ as a free tissue transfer.

TI  - Late digital replantation failure: pathophysiology and risk factors.  
AB  - It is generally accepted that replanted digits surviving at least 1 week following surgery rarely succumb to ischemic necrosis. Presented here are 2 patients who experienced late digital replantation failure. The first patient is an 8-year-old boy who had his index finger replanted at the proximal phalangeal level. After 16 days of viability, the replanted digit became swollen and subsequently necrosed. The second patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of smoking and intravenous drug use who underwent replantation of his avulsed thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint. The replanted thumb was viable at the 2-week follow-up, but began to show ischemic changes at 3 weeks and eventually required revision amputation at the interphalangeal level. Both of these patients demonstrate late digital replantation failure--an unusual and poorly understood phenomenon. A discussion of possible risk factors and potential pathophysiology is presented.

TI  - [Evolution of fox rabies in Belgium and the European Union]  
AB  - Since 1989, after experimental trials, Belgium like other concerned member States within the European Union, organizes campaigns of fox vaccination against rabies. These vaccination campaigns are using a recombinant vaccinia-rabies virus as vaccine in Belgium, Grand-Duchy of Luxemburg and a large part of France. The results of epidemiological surveillance show a dramatic reduction of the incidence of rabies in the treated areas; this reduction is also observed in domestic animals and as a consequence, the number of post-exposure treatments in man is considerably reduced. After a period of elimination, rabies did reappear in the south of Belgium in 1994. Strains of rabies virus isolated in the infected area showed similar nucleic acid sequences both in Belgium and along the border in France. The situation of rabies in the continental part of the European Union permits to envisage its elimination in the short run. This elimination could provoke a modification in the quarantine regulations on pet importation in United Kingdom and, as a result, improve the movement of people within the entire European Union.

TI  - [Phosphate deficiency as a rare cause of osteomalacia--case report of several years of enteral feeding and antacid therapy]  
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: Floor-of-the-mouth cancer had been diagnosed and surgically treated in a 55-year-old man 4 years before the latest admission. For the last 3 years he had been fed through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Since then he had experienced reflux oesophagitis which was being treated with aluminium-containing antacids. He was hospitalized for the surgical treatment of bilateral fractures of the neck of the femur. A surgical biopsy revealed osteomalacia but no metastasis. INVESTIGATIONS: The serum phosphate level was significantly reduced (0.21 mmol/l) and there was no detectable phosphate excretion in the 24-hour urine. Serum calcium concentration was unremarkable, but there was hypercalciuria (34.4 mmol/d). Alkaline phosphate activity was significantly raised (393 U/l) and parathormone level reduced (7 ng/l). Vitamin D concentration was unremarkable. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The phosphate content in the parenteral feed was at first increased and additional phosphate was given by mouth. The calcium and phosphate levels slowly became normal only after medication had been changed from antacids to H2-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: In this case osteomalacia was caused not by vitamin D deficiency but by a lack of phosphate. The reduced intestinal phosphate absorption by the antacids only partially explains the pronounced clinical signs. If antacids are taken over long periods the phosphate balance should be carefully monitored to avoid osteomalacia.

A 37-year-old man was devoid of secondary sexual characteristics, but manifested tall stature with a eunuchoidal feature. Serum levels of GH, insulin-like growth factor-I, gonadotropins and testosterone were all below normal. GH secretion was not enhanced by any provocative stimulus. Adrenocorticotropic hormone increased after administration of corticotropin releasing hormone, but not after insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Thyrotropin increased in response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, but both free T3 and T4 did not rise. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a transected pituitary stalk. The present patient had hypopituitarism due to perinatal problems but had grown with the aid of non-GH growth-promoting factors, which suggests that man may be able to achieve statural growth even without GH.

TI  - Identification of the tRNAs which up-regulate agrostin, barley RIP and PAP-S, three ribosome-inactivating proteins of plant origin.  
AB  - Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP) are RNA-N-glycosidases widely diffused in plants which depurinate ribosomal RNA at a specific universally conserved position, A4324 in rat ribosomes. A small group of RIPs (cofactor-dependent RIPs) require ATP and tRNA to reach maximal activity on isolated ribosomes. The tRNA which stimulates gelonin was identified as tRNA(Trp). The present paper reports the identification of three other tRNAs which stimulate agrostin (tRNA(Ala)), barley RIP (tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Val)) and PAP-S (tRNA(Gly)), while for tritin-S no particular stimulating tRNA emerged. The sequences of tRNA(Val) and tRNA(Gly) correspond to the already known ones (rabbit and man, respectively). The tRNA(Ala) (anticodon IGC) identifies a new isoacceptor. Only the stimulating activity of the tRNA(Ala) for agrostin approaches the specificity previously observed for the couple gelonin-tRNA(Trp).

TI  - Factors associated with HIV testing among Canadians: results of a population-based survey.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the HIV-testing behaviour of Canadians aged 15 years and older. Questions on HIV testing were asked as part of a Canada-wide random digit dialling telephone survey conducted in December 1995 to January 1996 on health practices and attitudes toward health care in Canada (n=3123). Including blood donation and insurance testing, 40.4% of men and 30.4% of women had been tested for HIV. Excluding blood donation and life-insurance testing (voluntary testing), 17.8% of men and 15.6% of women had been tested. In multivariate analyses, factors independently associated with voluntary testing among men were: having had sex with a man (OR=16.8), injection drug use (OR=5.8), having had a partner at high risk (OR=2.5), having received blood or clotting factor (OR=2.3), being younger than 45 years of age (OR=1.8), living in a city of over one million (OR=1.7), and making less than $30,000 a year (OR=1.6). For women, factors independently associated with voluntary testing were having received blood or clotting factor (OR=3.9), having had a high-risk partner (OR= 3.5), being younger than 45 years of age (OR=2.4), having had sex with a man (OR=2.3), and being unattached (OR=2.0). Results indicated that those at risk are more likely to be tested. It is of concern, however, that many of those reporting risk factors have not been tested. A better understanding of HIV testing behaviour is needed to improve the planning and evaluation of prevention and counselling services.

TI  - Cybersemiotics: a transdisciplinary framework for information studies.  
AB  - This paper summarizes recent attempts by this author to create a transdisciplinary, non-Cartesian and non-reductionistic framework for information studies in natural, social, and technological systems. To confront, in a scientific way, the problems of modern information technology where phenomenological man is dealing with socially constructed texts in algorithmically based digital bit-machines we need a theoretical framework spanning from physics over biology and technological design to phenomenological and social production of signification and meaning. I am working with such pragmatic theories as second order cybernetics (coupled with autopolesis theory), Lakoffs biologically oriented cognitive semantics, Peirce's triadic semiotics, and Wittgenstein's pragmatic language game theory. A coherent synthesis of these theories is what the cybersemiotic framework attempts to accomplish.

TI  - [Guillain-Barre syndrome with nerve conduction blocks at multiple common entrapment sites that rapidly disappeared after plasmapheresis]  
AB  - Nerve conduction blocks (NCBs) in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) are frequently found at the distal terminals, proximal segments, and common entrapment sites of peripheral nerves. NCBs at distal terminals and proximal segments are considered to be due to vulnerability of the sites to the humoral factors of GBS because of relative blood-nerve barrier deficiencies. In contrast, it is not clear whether NCBs at common entrapment sites in GBS are due to a vulnerability to humoral influences or to direct mechanical compression injuries. We report a case of a 22-year-old man with GBS. His electrophysiologic examination revealed NCBs at multiple common entrapment sites. All conduction blocks rapidly disappeared after plasmapheresis, in parallel with clinical improvement. The patient was ambulatory throughout the clinical course, suggesting that his common entrapment sites remained free from compression injuries. Rapid improvement by plasmapheresis suggested that there were no demyelinative histologic changes in the NCB sites. Such NCBs may be caused by some humoral factor that is removed by plasmapheresis. Therefore, the common entrapment sites in our patient may have been especially vulnerable to the humoral factor of GBS.

TI  - Pseudomyxoma peritonei. A report of three cases and a review of published reports.  
AB  - Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a disease characterized by the progressive accumulation of mucinous ascites within the abdomen and pelvis. Metastatic disease outside the peritoneal cavity is unusual. Gastrointestinal function is lost from external compression of stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. We present three cases of pseudomyxoma peritonei which were treated by different therapeutic methods. Case 1 was a 61-year-old man who underwent treatment by appendectomy with administration of Cisplatin and Doxorubicin hydrochloride into the intraperitoneal cavity. Case 2 was a 64-year-old woman who underwent bilateral oophorectomy with administration of Cisplatin and ADM into the intraperitoneal cavity. About 4 years after the first operation, she died of peritonitis due to small and large bowel perforations underlying recurrent tumors. Case 3 was a 79-year-old woman who underwent surgery to evacuate about 4000 ml of mucinous ascites, and received intraperitoneal administration of 5-Fluorouracil (500 mg/day) for 5 days without severe complications.

TI  - Enhanced phenotypic expression of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in an MZ heterozygote with chronic hepatitis C.  
AB  -  A middle-aged white man of Scotch-Irish ancestry, being treated for chronic hepatitis C, was found to be heterozygous for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (PiMZ phenotype) after diagnostic PAS-positive, diastase-resistant globules were detected in a liver biopsy. The globules had not been present in a biopsy obtained 4 yr previously. He was also found to be heterozygous for the cys282tyr mutation of the HFE gene, which is the chief cause of HLA-linked hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). His liver disease progressed over 4 yr from mild hepatitis to moderate hepatitis with cirrhosis despite therapy with interferon-alpha, and phlebotomy plus interferon. These conditions appeared to have synergistic effects, with the chronic viral hepatitis unmasking the alpha1AT deficiency, and the alpha1AT deficiency (and possibly the heterozygosity for HHC), exacerbating the course of the hepatitis C.

TI  - Status and future of clinical pathology in Nepal.  
AB  - Clinical Pathology (CP) in Nepal is still in primitive stage. All most all CP tests are done manually. In many health institutions, even a basic CP test facilities are not available leading to an empirical treatment. Even the so-called big medical centers are lacking many important CP test facilities forcing the patients (those who can afford) to proceed to foreign countries for investigation and treatment of their health problem. With regard to the training of man power in the field of CP, Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine began an academic training course called Proficiency Certificate Level in Health Laboratory Technology (PCL Health Lab.) in 1972. Presently, undergraduate and post-graduate courses, namely, Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Technology (BMLT) and MD Pathology are also being run since 1987 and 1996, respectively. Presently, CP services in Nepal are being rendered at both public and private sectors. CP services in private sector are provided by small so-called CP laboratories usually attached to a medical shops to a well set laboratories run by qualified man power. All most all private CP laboratories in Nepal function at morning and/or evening as they are run by the people working at the hospitals or other medical institutions during day time. Beside, newly emerged nursing homes are also providing CP services. However, quality control system in CP service in Nepal, is not effective yet. Thus, establishment of a national institution functioning as both referral CP center and quality monitoring body on CP services, and introduction of mandatory CP license examination appears to be an urgent need of the days to provide a qualitative CP service to the needy people.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of granulomatous cystitis in a patient receiving bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical therapy for urothelial carcinoma in situ. METHODS: A 58-year-old man undergoing BCG intravesical therapy for urothelial carcinoma in situ presented symptoms of intense cystitis. Cystoscopy was performed and several bladder cold biopsies were obtained. RESULTS: Histopathological analysis demonstrated epithelioid granulomas. CONCLUSION: Cystitis arising from BCG therapy is defined as drug-induced or BCG-induced cystitis. Intense cystitis and malaise are a serious complication since it is not possible to distinguish patients with a simple uncomplicated local reaction from those who will develop progressive systemic infection. Cystoscopy and biopsy can be helpful in determining the nature of the condition and are recommended.

TI  - Correlation between magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology of an amputated forearm after an electrical injury.  
AB  -  A 53-year-old man sustained a 50 Hz, 60 kV electrical injury. The current flowed between his right hand and both feet. There was necrosis of the distal portion of the right forearm, and the fourth and fifth toes on the right foot. The skin on the amputated right upper extremity appeared normal except for an ulcer in the antecubital fossa and some blister scars. However, most of the muscles of the arm at the elbow were necrosed and partially replaced by fatty tissue or fibrosis. These necrotic areas corresponded to minimally increased signal intensities on T1-weighted MRI, and high signal intensities on T2-weighted images. MRI may be employed to predict amputation level after electrical injury.

Chest radiographs and chest CT on admission showed old inflammatory shadows in both upper lung fields and a fungus ball in the left upper lung field. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's sputum volume increased and Aspergillus niger was repeatedly cultured from his sputum. Chest radiographs showed deterioration around the intracavitary fungus ball and a test for serum aspergillus antigen was positive. Secondary invasive pulmonary aspergillosis originating from aspergilloma was diagnosed based on his clinical symptoms, radiographic features and laboratory data. Administration of fluconazole failed to improve his clinical course and amphotericin B was discontinued because of hypokalemia. Oral administration of itraconazole was a successful treatment.

TI  - Coexistent hairy cell leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.  
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) are chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (B-LPDs) with distinct clinical, morphological and immunocytochemical features. Transformation of CLL into other B-LPDs (prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) and large cell lymphoma) is a well recognised phenomenon. One previous report has suggested that HCL may also arise by clonal evolution from CLL. We report the case of a 75 year old man in whom a diagnosis of coexisting HCL was made seventeen years after an initial diagnosis of CLL. Immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement studies suggest that the two B-LPDs developed independently. A steady increase in the bone marrow HCL component at the expense of the CLL component was observed with time, suggesting that HCL may have a growth advantage over CLL.

A 64-year-old man with 74% body surface burn without any inhalation injury experienced acute pulmonary edema on hospital day 11 associated with high-minute volume and negative inspiratory pressures at the ventilator. The edema cleared after sedation and paralysis. Workup disclosed pulmonary emboli and normal cardiac-filling pressures. A mechanical model, simulating his breathing, measured intrathoracic pressure of -37 +/- 12 mm Hg, which is sufficiently negative to cause pulmonary edema despite a patent airway. Pulmonary emboli increased his respiratory drive to amounts greater than what the ventilator could deliver, thus leading to the large negative intrathoracic pressure and pulmonary edema.

COURSE: Twenty-four years later he gradually develops a chronic lymphatic leukaemia (B-CLL) which up to now does not need treatment (October 1996). The neoplastic B-cells exprime monoclonal lightchain lambda on the cellmembrane and in the cytoplasma undetectable by immunefixation in the serum. Irrespective of that the known monoclonal gammopathy exprimes IgG-kappa without an increase in the number of plasmacells in the bonemarrow. CONCLUSION: There are hints that the congenital Noonan-syndrome can be associated with B-cell disorders.

TI  - A 15-year follow-up study of ventilatory function in adults with asthma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of asthma and morbidity related to asthma are increasing, little is known about the natural history of lung function in adults with this disease. METHODS: We used data from a longitudinal epidemiologic study of the general population in a Danish city, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, to analyze changes over time in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in adults with self-reported asthma and adults without asthma. The study was conducted between 1976 and 1994; for each patient, three measurements of lung function were obtained over a 15-year period. The final data set consisted of measurements from 17,506 subjects (8136 men and 9370 women), of whom 1095 had asthma. RESULTS: Among subjects who participated in all three evaluations, the unadjusted decline in FEV1 among subjects with asthma was 38 ml per year, as compared with 22 ml per year in those without asthma. The decline in FEV1 normalized for height (FEV1 divided by the square of the height in meters) was greater among the subjects with asthma than among those without the disease (P<0.001). Among both men and women, and among both smokers and nonsmokers, subjects with asthma had greater declines in FEV1 over time than those without asthma (P<0.001). At the age of 60 years, a 175-cm-tall nonsmoking man without asthma had an average FEV1 of 3.05 liters, as compared with 1.99 liters for a man of similar age and height who smoked and had asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of the general population, people who identified themselves as having asthma had substantially greater declines in FEV1 over time than those who did not.
