TI  - Oligomerization of the EGF receptor transmembrane domain: a 2H NMR study in lipid bilayers.  
AB  - During the course of a previous study by wideline 2H NMR, we noted spectral features suggesting the possibility of monitoring homodimer/oligomer interactions between transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor in lipid bilayers [Rigby, A. R., Shaw, G. S., Barber, K. R., & Grant, C. W. M. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 12591-12601]. In the present work this possibility was explored using the 34-residue peptide EGFRtm. The peptide sequence included the 23 amino acid hydrophobic stretch thought to span the membrane (Ile622-Met644 of the EGF receptor), plus the first 10 amino acids of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain (Arg645-Thr654). Selective deuteration was carried out at sites corresponding to Ala623, Met644, and Val650. Samples were studied from 12 to 65 degrees C by 2H NMR in fluid membranes having low peptide concentration (1 mol %) or high peptide concentration (6 mol %). Methyl groups proved to be technically particularly attractive probe locations. Reversible homodimer/oligomer interactions were detected in membranes of the common natural phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), without cholesterol. Effects on the EGF receptor transmembrane domain included alterations in peptide backbone motional order and/or conformation at the site of Ala623 within the membrane, and alterations in motional properties of the Val650 side chain in the cytoplasmic domain. There was little spectral evidence of stable oligomer formation except at the lowest temperature studied. Addition of 33% cholesterol to these membranes was accompanied by spectral changes consistent with the formation of more stable peptide oligomers, and by evidence that peptide-peptide interactions were sensed at all three probe locations. Peptide-peptide interactions remained easily reversible, particularly at higher temperatures. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the NMR samples demonstrated peptide-related intramembranous particles traversing the membranes. To our knowledge, this is the first electron microscopy description of receptor tyrosine kinases or their fragments in model membranes. In the presence of cholesterol, the peptide-related particles were generally larger, more sharply demarcated, and showed a tendency to cluster. These observations relate to models of receptor lateral association as an aspect of signal transduction, and to forces that may determine protein sorting and organization in cell membranes. We suggest that the cholesterol effects reflect a general phenomenon rather than one specific to the EGF receptor.

TI  - cAMP-dependent phosphorylation activates phosphofructokinase from mantle tissue of the mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis. Identification of the phosphorylated site.  
AB  - Phosphofructokinase from mantle tissue of the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was phosphorylated in vitro by a protein kinase isolated from the same tissue, homologous to mammalian cAMP-dependent protein kinase; the maximal level of phosphorylation achieved was around 1 mol of Pi/mol of phosphofructokinase subunit. The covalent incorporation of phosphate leads to a notable increase in the enzyme activity assayed at near-physiological concentrations of substrates and allosteric modulators and neutral pH. Tryptic digestion of labeled phosphofructokinase released a phosphopeptide whose sequence was Lys-Asp-Ser(P)-Ile-Trp-Ile-Gln-Thr-Gly-Arg. This sequence showed high homology with the phosphopeptides from other invertebrates whose phosphofructokinase is also activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation.

TI  - Contractile responses of cultured bovine retinal pericytes to angiotensin II.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document that angiotensin (ANG) II contracts cultured bovine retinal pericytes via saralasin-sensitive receptors if the cells are prerelaxed. METHODS: Changes in the contractile tone were quantified as the changes in the summed length of wrinkles induced by pericytes cultured on the silicone surface. RESULTS: Angiotensin II (10(-5) mol/L) did not increase the contractile tone of cultured pericytes that were not prerelaxed. However, when the pericytes had been prerelaxed 41% with 10(-6)-mol/L sodium nitroprusside, ANG II at the range of 10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L caused prompt, dose-related, significant (P<.01) contraction. It induced a maximum contraction (29.9%+/-5.2% [mean+/-SE]) at 10(-6) mol/L. This effect lasted at least 10 minutes. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (10(-6) mol/L) abolished the contractile effect of ANG II (10(-6) mol/L), although by itself it did not affect the contractile tone. CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin II contracts cultured pericytes through saralasin-sensitive ANG II receptors. If ANG II affects the contractile tone of pericytes in vivo, it may affect capillary caliber, resistance, and blood flow.

TI  - Purinergic transmitters inhibit bone formation by cultured osteoblasts.  
AB  - Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and other purinoceptor agonists cause a transient rise in [Ca2+]i in cultured osteoblast-like cells and have a mitogenic effect, as does parathyroid hormone (PTH), and there is evidence that ATP and PTH can act synergistically on osteoblasts. The likelihood that nucleotides, acting through purinoceptors, are important local factors in bone remodeling is therefore considerable. However, their effect on bone formation is unknown. We recently developed a culture system in which appositional bone formation occurs only in narrow grooves cut in a substratum. We have used this as an assay to measure the effects of ATP (50 and 500 mumol/L), ATP gamma S (20 mumol/L), 2-MeSATP (2 and 20 mumol/L), uridine triphosphate (UTP) (0.2, 2, and 20 mumol/L), adenosine (20 mumol/L), bovine PTH (0.25 and 0.5 IU/mL), rat PTH1-34 (10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/L), and rat PTHrP1-40 (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/L) on bone formation by rat calvarial osteoblasts. The culture medium was renewed 3 times/week (every 2 or 3 days), and the number of bone loci and length and area of Alizarin red-stained mineralized bone formed in the grooves of each specimen in 16-29 days were measured. Compared with controls, ATP gamma S, 2-MeSATP, and ATP reduced the amount of bone formed in a 2-3 week culture period. Adenosine had no effect, and UTP either had no effect or at 2 mumol/L stimulated bone formation. PTH and PTHrP completely abolished bone formation in 4 week cultures. Our findings are consistent with evidence for more than one P2 purinoceptor subtype in bone, and show for the first time that the effect of ATP on appositional bone formation by osteoblasts in vitro is, like PTH and PTHrP, inhibitory.

TI  - Human recombinant phosphodiesterase 4B2B binds (R)-rolipram at a single site with two affinities.  
AB  - The interactions between (R)-rolipram and purified human recombinant low-Km, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (HSPDE4B2B) constructs were investigated using biochemical, kinetic, and biophysical approaches. The full-length protein (amino acids 1-564) and an N-terminal truncated protein (amino acids 81-564) exhibited high-affinity (R)-rolipram binding, whereas an N-terminal and C-terminal truncated protein (amino acids 152-528) lacked high-affinity (R)-rolipram binding. The 152-528 and 81-564 proteins had similar Km's and kcat/Km's and differed less than 4-fold compared with the 1-564 protein. (R)-Rolipram inhibition plots were biphasic for the 1-564 and 81-564 proteins and fit to two states, a high-affinity (Ki = 5-10 nM) state and a low-affinity (Ki = 200-400 nM) state, whereas the 152-528 protein fit to a single state (Ki = 350-400 nM). The stoichiometry for high-affinity binding using a filter binding assay was found to be <1 mol of (R)-rolipram per mole of 1-564 or 81-564 protein. Titration microcalorimetric studies revealed both a high-affinity state with a stoichiometry of 0.3 mol of (R)-rolipram per mole of protein and a low-affinity state with a stoichiometry of 0.6 mol of (R)-rolipram per mole of protein for the 81-564 protein. A single low-affinity state with a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of (R)-rolipram per mole of protein was seen using the 152-528 protein. The data indicate that purified HSPDE4B2B 1-564 and 81-564 proteins contain a single binding site for (R)-rolipram and suggest that the proteins exist in two different states distinguishable by their affinity for (R)-rolipram. Furthermore, the high-affinity binding state of the protein requires amino acid residues at the N-terminus (81-151) of the protein and catalytic domain (152-528), whereas the low-affinity binding state only requires residues in the catalytic domain (152-528). Phosphorylation at residues 487 and 489 of the 81-564 protein does not appear to alter the substrate kinetics or the stoichiometry and binding affinity of (R)-rolipram.

TI  - Counter current transfer of beta-endorphin in the perihypophyseal cavernous sinus--carotid rete vascular complex of sheep.  
AB  - This study was performed to answer the question of whether counter current retrograde transfer of beta-endorphin in the perihypophyseal cavernous sinus-carotid rete vascular complex depends on the reproductive activity of sheep and if this transfer depends on membrane Na+ K+ ATP-ase blocking by ouabain. Sheep were anaesthetised and the jugular vein and the carotid artery were cannulated on both sides. Multielectrolitical liquids (Solfin, Polfa "Kutno", Poland): 500 ml of Solfin with heparin (25,000 IU), or Solfin with heparin and ouabain (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) in concentrations of 10(-5) or 10(-4) mol 1(-1) were infused into the brain through the carotid artery. Heparinized blood was collected through the carotid artery. After exsanguination, the head with the neck was removed. The isolated head was supplied with oxygenated, heated, autologous blood diluted with Solfin (4:1) without or with ouabain in concentration of 10(-5) or 10(-4) mol 1(-1). Blood pressure and temperature were measured throughout the duration of the experiment. During the experiment 125I-beta-endorphin (7.9 x 107 dpm) dissolved in 10 ml of Solfin was infused for 5 min (5 ml) into each cavernous sinus through the angularis oculi veins. Blood samples for radioactivity measurements were collected each min from the carotid rete (through the opposite carotid artery to the artery supplying the brain with arterial blood) and from both jugular veins. In all the experiments significant 125I-beta-endorphin radioactivity was found in arterial blood supplying the brain and hypophysis in the early luteal phase in sheep. No radioactivity was found (with the exception of one animal) in sheep during seasonal anoestrus. A blockage of Na+ K+ ATP-ase by ouabain administered during exsanguination and during head perfusion with dose of 10(-4) mol 1(-1) reduced beta-endorphin counter current transfer to arterial blood, but this effect was not evident with the dose of 10(-5) mol 1(-1). Increased blood pressure was observed in all the experiments with either dose of ouabain.

TI  - Complement mediates attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxations in canine coronary arteries after porcine serum exposure: a mechanism for vascular thrombosis in xenograft hyperacute rejection.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence for complement activation in xenograft hyperacute rejection includes prolongation of graft survival after complement inactivation as well as component deposition and consumption during hyperacute rejection. The current investigations examined the endothelial production of vasoactive substances during heterologous serum exposure. METHODS: Segments of canine coronary artery were exposed to either autologous canine serum for 90 minutes or heterologous porcine serum for 30, 60, or 90 minutes. After replacement of the serum with buffered saline, segments were contracted with phenylephrine (10(-6) mol/L) in the presence of indomethacin (10(-5) mol/L). RESULTS: Compared with responses of vessels exposed to autologous canine serum, receptor-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired in arteries after 60 or 90 minutes of exposure to porcine serum. Receptor-independent relaxation to calcium ionophore A23187 was not significantly impaired at any length of porcine serum exposure. Endothelial-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not impaired with either canine or porcine serum exposure. Oxyhemoglobin (10(-6) mol/L) abolished acetylcholine-mediated relaxation, indicating that nitric oxide was the predominant mediator of the impaired pathway. Basal release of nitric oxide after a 60-minute porcine serum exposure was reduced by half compared with coronary arteries exposed to autologous canine serum. Serum pretreated by either heat inactivation of complement or immunoadsorption with anti-C3 antibodies failed to depress endothelial-dependent relaxation on 60 minutes of exposure to canine coronary arteries. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an intact endothelial layer in coronary arteries exposed to either porcine or canine serum for 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacute xenograft rejection impairs receptor-dependent relaxation of canine coronary arteries at 60 and 90 minutes. These data strongly suggest that impairment of endothelial production of nitric oxide during acute xenograft rejection is mediated by complement activation.

TI  - A stable intermediate product of the archaeal zinc-containing 7Fe ferredoxin from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 by artificial oxidative conversion.  
AB  - Irreversible conversion of the purified zinc-containing 7Fe ferredoxin from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 was found to occur under aerobic conditions at pH 5.0 and at 4 degrees C. This process accompanied a substantial increase of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal attributed to a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster, and the converted form containing approximately 6 Fe/Zn (mol/mol) had a net charge different from that of the native 7Fe ferredoxin. These data provide evidence for the formation of a stable intermediate product of the archaeal ferredoxin having two [3Fe-4S] clusters and a zinc center by artificial oxidative degradation. This further explains the discrepancy that a zinc center and two [3Fe-4S] clusters (but not a zinc center and one [3Fe-4S] cluster plus one [4Fe-4S] cluster) are observed in the crystal structure at pH 5.0.

TI  - Evidence for cell surface and internal phospholipase activity in ascidian eggs.  
AB  - Upon fertilization, ascidian eggs release a cell surface glycosidase used in the block to polyspermy and undergo cortical contractions resulting from increased intracellular calcium levels. The glycosidase is released by fertilization, calcium ionophores or added phospholipase C (PLC) activity. The PLC inhibitor D609 blocks glycosidase release. Intact Ascidia ceratodes eggs cleave 4-methylumbelliferyl-phospho-choline when it is added to seawater. This yields highly fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone. Authentic phospholipase C but not phospholipase D can cleave this substrate. Thus, the authors believe that cleavage of the substrate is specific for PLC activity. Eggs incubated in the fluorogenic substrate after having been washed and detergent extracted were not fluorescent. Therefore the substrate failed to enter intact cells. Glycosidase release and PLC activity were stimulated by ionomycin. Octylglucoside or Triton X-100 extracts of ascidian eggs had two forms of phospholipase activity as shown by ion affinity chromatography: PL1 eluting at 0.25 mol/L NaCl and PL2 eluting at 0.6 mol/L NaCl. The PL1 appeared to be isolated as a single protein. When surface proteins were labeled with non-penetrating biotin and were subsequently reacted with streptavidin, half of the PLC activity bound. This demonstrates that half the ascidian egg PLC activity is located on the surface of either the egg or follicle cell, and half is located within the egg.

TI  - Endothelin-1 as an autocrine/paracrine apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells [published erratum appears Hypertension 1998 Feb;31(2):723]  
AB  - Endothelin-1 (ET-1), an endothelium-derived vasoactive peptide, functions as a potent vasoconstrictor as well as mitogen. We show here a novel role for ET-1 as an apoptosis survival factor for cultured rat endothelial cells. When we rendered endothelial cells obtained from rat aorta quiescent by serum starvation, significant portions of cultured cells underwent apoptotic death as demonstrated by nucleosomal laddering on agarose gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry analysis with FACS, and the TdT-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. ET-1 dose-dependently (10[-12] to 10[-6] mol/L) suppressed the apoptosis induced by serum starvation. The ET(B) receptor antagonist (BQ788; 10[-6] mol/L) and ET(A/B) receptor antagonists (PD142893 and PD145065; 10[-6] mol/L), but not the ET(A) receptor antagonist (BQ123; 10[-6] mol/L), blocked the apoptosis protective effect of 10[-7] mol/L ET-1. Nonimmune rabbit serum reduced the apoptotic event induced by serum deprivation, whereas neutralization of endogenous ET-1 by polyclonal anti-ET-1 antiserum abrogated this protective effect. The ET(B) receptor antagonist (BQ788; 10[-8] to 10[-6] mol/L), but not the ET(A) receptor antagonist (BQ123; 10[-8] to 10[-6] mol/L), significantly inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells. These data suggest that ET-1, as well as mitogen, functions as an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the ET(B) receptor.

TI  - The fetoplacental pressor effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and angiotensin II in the ex vivo cotyledon model.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate perfusion pressure changes ex vivo induced by angiotensin II on fetoplacental vasculature pretreated with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. STUDY DESIGN: Two cotyledons from each of 12 placentas were perfused. The intervillous space of one cotyledon was infused with acetylsalicylic acid (5 x 10(-5) mol/L) similar to the serum concentration of women receiving daily low-dose aspirin therapy (60 to 81 mg). The control cotyledon was infused with an equivalent amount of normal saline solution. Two doses of angiotensin II, 1 x 10(-11.5) and 1 x 10(-10) moles, were injected as boluses into the chorionic arteries of each cotyledon. A 3 x 10(-7) mole dose of angiotensin II was also injected into the intervillous space. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance, and results are expressed as mean pressure change in millimeters of mercury +/- SEM. RESULTS: Perfusion pressure response did not vary between cotyledons pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid and control cotyledons when 3 x 10(-7) moles of angiotensin II was injected into the intervillous space (8.0 +/- 1.9 mm Hg vs 9.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p = 0.59). There were no differences between cotyledons in pressure response to 1 x 10(-11.5) moles of angiotensin II injected into the fetal circuit (5.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg vs 6.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p = 0.51). However, in the cotyledons pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid there was a decrease in the pressor response to 1 x 10(-10) moles of angiotensin II (14.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg vs 21.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin infused into the intervillous space decreases vasoconstriction elicited by angiotensin II in the fetoplacental compartment. This suggests that maternal low-dose aspirin therapy has effects in the fetoplacental circulation in addition to its effects in the maternal circulation.

TI  - Tissue-specific regulation of renal and cardiac atrial natriuretic factor gene expression in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats.  
AB  - Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is expressed in several noncardiac tissues where it may have an autocrine or paracrine function. Such function may be expected of locally synthesized ANF in the renal parenchyma. Previous investigations of the existence of ANF mRNA in the renal parenchyma have yielded conflicting results. The investigations reported here were designed to detect and measure ANF mRNA in normal rats and in rats subjected to a deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treatment schedule known to strongly activate cardiac ANF gene expression. The expression of the renal ANF gene was measured using a newly developed quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QC-RT-PCR). This method uses an internal competitor that serves as an internal standard and makes the procedure independent of measurement relative to housekeeping genes. It was found that renal ANF mRNA levels were 10(7) times lower than those found in left or right atria, but immunoreactive (ir) renal ANF concentration by specific radioimmunoassay was 10(4) times lower than that of atrial irANF levels. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that more than 99% of renal irANF is processed ANF(99-126). This finding suggests that most of the irANF measured in kidney extracts likely originates from atrial sources. Left atrial ANF mRNA levels after 1 week of DOCA-salt treatment was significantly higher than that of control rats ([21.06+/-2.99] x 10(-l5) mol/microg total RNAversus [8.59 +/-1.26] x 10(-5) mol/microg total RNA, P<.05). However, renal ANF mRNA levels in DOCA-salt rats were significantly decreased compared with those of control rats ([1.64+/-0.34] x 10(-22) mol/microg total RNA versus [3.96+/-0.61]x 10(-22) mol/microg total RNA, P<.05). These results indicate that (1) renal ANF mRNA can be consistently and specifically demonstrated after reverse transcription and PCR amplification; (2) renal and cardiac ANF synthesis are regulated in a tissue-specific, opposite manner during DOCA-salt treatment; and (3) the finding that renal ANF mRNA is downregulated by DOCA-salt treatment together with previous findings suggest the need for further investigation into the role of renal ANF mRNA downregulation in the pathogenetic mechanism that leads to volume expansion and hypertension after chronic DOCA-salt treatment.

TI  - A vesicular variant of bullous pemphigoid with autoantibodies against unidentified 205- and 150-kDa proteins at the basement membrane zone.  
AB  - We describe a 75-year-old man who developed a vesicular variant of bullous pemphigoid with a distinctive result of immunoblot analysis. Characteristic symptoms consisted of vesiculopapular eruptions with erythematous patches on the arms and legs, many of which fused to form irregularly outlined areas of erythema varying in size. Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear deposition of IgG at the basement membrane zone of the skin, and indirect immunofluorescence detected circulating IgG autoantibodies at a titre of 1:160, which reacted with the antigens located on the epidermal side of skin split with 1 mol/L NaCl. Immunoblot analysis using epidermal extracts demonstrated the presence of IgG antibodies directed to 150, 205, 240 and 280 kDa proteins as well as to the 180 kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2). All antibodies eluted from nitrocellulose membrane imprints of individual bands with molecular weights of 150, 180 and 205 kDa were found by indirect immunofluorescence to react with the basement membrane zone, whereas those eluted from the bands with molecular weights of 240 and 280 kDa did not. These findings suggest that antibodies directed not only to the 180 kDa BPAG2, but also to 150 and 205 kDa proteins, are involved in the pathogenesis of bulla formation in this patient.

At low salt concentrations (<50 mM KCl) the unfolding transitions are not two-state, but they approach two-state behavior at higher salt concentrations. The structure is preferentially stabilized by smaller alkali metal ions (Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+) and by NH4+; the same preferences are exhibited by one of the stems in the context of a hairpin. Divalent metal ions are not required to fold the pseudoknot but do stabilize it further. To examine divalent ion effects over a wide concentration range, urea was used to lower the RNA unfolding temperature and was shown not to affect characteristics of the pseudoknot unfolding in other respects. The pseudoknot binds divalent ions somewhat more tightly than a hairpin but shows only weak selectivity for different size ions. It is suggested that a region of "intermediate" divalent ion binding affinity, in between highly ligated specific sites and purely delocalized ion binding in character, is created by the pseudoknot fold but that nonspecific, delocalized ion binding contributes at least half the free energy of pseudoknot stabilization by Mg2+.

TI  - The cholesterol dependence of activation and fast desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  
AB  - When nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are reconstituted into lipid bilayers lacking cholesterol, agonists no longer stimulate cation flux. The kinetics of this process are difficult to study because variations in vesicle morphology cause errors in flux measurements. We developed a new stopped-flow fluorescence assay to study activation independently of vesicle morphology. When receptors were rapidly mixed with agonist plus ethidium, the earliest fluorescence increase reported the fraction of channels that opened and their apparent rate of fast desensitization. These processes were absent when the receptor was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine or into a mixture of that lipid with dioleoylphosphatidic acid (12 mol%), even though a fluorescent agonist reported that resting-state receptors were still present. The agonist-induced channel opening probability increased with bilayer cholesterol, with a midpoint value of 9 +/- 1.7 mol% and a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.69, reaching a plateau above 20-30 mol% cholesterol that was equal to the native value. On the other hand, the observed fast desensitization rate was comparable to that for native membranes from the lowest cholesterol concentration examined (5 mol%). Thus the ability to reach the open state after activation varies with the cholesterol concentration in the bilayer, whereas the rate of the open state to fast desensitized state transition is unaffected. The structural basis for this is unknown, but an interesting corollary is that the channels of newly synthesized receptors are not fully primed by cholesterol until they are inserted into the plasma membrane--a novel form of posttranslational processing.

TI  - [Effect of intrahippocampal microinjection of enkephalin on cellular immune function and brain IL-1 alpha gene expression in rat]  
AB  - The effect of intrahippocampal microinjection of enkephalin on cellular immune function and hippocampal IL-1 alpha gene expression was studied in rats. The results showed that: (1) The proliferation activity of splenic lymphocytes stimulated by Con A was significantly increased with microinjection of Leu-enkephalin 1 microliter (18 mmol/L) or Met-enkephalin 1 microliter (18 mmol/L) into bilateral hippocampus, but was inhibited by Lipopolysaccharide 1 microliter (50 ng/microliter). The proliferative response of splenic lymphocytes to Leu-enkephalin still persisted after bilateral adrenalectomy. Low doses of Leu- or Met-enkephalin (10(-10), 10(-11) mol/L) were also capable of causing proliferative activity of the Con A- stimulated cultured splenic lymphocytes in vitro. (2) Using RT-PCR technique, IL-1 alpha gene expression was detected in hippocampus 90 min after bilateral intrahippocampal injection of LPS. The LPS-induced IL-1 alpha gene expression in hippocampus could no longer be detected 30 min after microinjection of Met- or Leu-enkephalin into hippocampus. The above results suggested that intrahippocampal enkephalin might play an important role in neuro-immunomodulation by enhancing the inhibition of IL-1 alpha gene expression in hippocampal formation.

TI  - Kinase-related protein (telokin) is phosphorylated by smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase and modulates the kinase activity.  
AB  - Telokin is an abundant smooth-muscle protein with an amino acid sequence identical with that of the C-terminal region of smooth-muscle myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), although it is expressed as a separate protein [Gallagher and Herring (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23945-23952]. Here we demonstrate that telokin is also similar to smooth-muscle myosin regulatory light chain (ReLC) not only in its gross physical properties but also as an MLCK substrate. Telokin was slowly phosphorylated by MLCK in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin and could be readily dephosphorylated by myosin light-chain phosphatase. A threonine residue was phosphorylated with up to 0.25 mol/mol stoichiometry. This low stoichiometry, together with the observed dimerization of telokin [Sobieszek and Nieznanski (1997) Biochem. J. 322, 65-71], indicates that the telokin dimer was acting as the substrate with a single protomer being phosphorylated. Our enzyme kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation reaction confirms this interpretation. Because telokin phosphorylation also required micromolar concentrations of MLCK, which also facilitates the formation of kinase oligomers, we concluded that the oligomers are interacting with telokin. Thus it seems that telokin modulates the phosphorylation rate of myosin filaments by a mechanism that includes the direct or indirect inhibition of the kinase active site by the telokin dimer, and that removal of the inhibition is controlled by slow phosphorylation of the telokin dimer, which results in MLCK dimerization.

AB  - The concentration-dependent effects of chromium picolinate and chromium nicotinate were assessed on the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals, and lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in cultured macrophage J774A.1 cells. The macrophage cells were incubated with 0-50 micrograms/ml [corrected] concentrations of these chromium (III) salts for 0 and 24 hrs at 37 degrees C. Concentration-dependent effects were observed. Lipid peroxidation increased by 1.3-1.5-fold following treatment of these cells with chromium picolinate while at these same concentrations of chromium nicotinate approximately 1.2-1.8-fold increases in lipid peroxidation were observed. Increases of 1.0-1.5-fold occurred in the production of superoxide anion as determined by cytochrome c reduction following treatment with chromium picolinate while with these same concentrations and conditions only 1.1-1.2-fold increases in cytochrome c reduction were observed following treatment with chromium nicotinate. Approximately 1.2-1.5-fold increases in hydroxyl radical production were observed following treatment of these macrophage cells with increasing concentrations of chromium picolinate and chromium nicotinate. Incubation of the cells with 30-50 micrograms/ml concentrations of chromium picolinate produced 1.2-1.6 fold increases in DNA fragmentation, while under these same conditions with chromium nicotinate 1.2-1.3-fold increases in DNA fragmentation occurred. No significant loss in cell viability was observed with either chromium salt. These results demonstrate that incubation of macrophage J774A.1 cells with these chromium salts induces low levels of oxidative stress as demonstrated by the biochemical assay techniques employed in this study.

TI  - NMR detection of 13CH313COOH from 3-13C-glucose: a signature for Bifidobacterium fermentation in the intestinal tract.  
AB  - The gastrointestinal tracts of breast-fed infants are colonized more easily with bifidobacteria than are those of formula-fed infants. Colonization is thought to reduce infant diarrhea. Amendments to formulas that improve colonization by bifidobacteria are being actively investigated. Colonization studies almost invariably require measurements of the concentration of the bifidobacteria in feces to assess their importance in the colon. We investigated the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of products of fermentations of 1- and 3-13C-glucose to evaluate the importance of bifidobacteria in the colonic ecosystem. Bifidobacteria use a unique pathway of hexose catabolism to produce primarily acetate and lactate. The fermentation yields 3 mol of acetate from 2 mol of glucose. Two of the acetates are formed from C1 and C2 of glucose and the third is formed entirely from C3 of glucose. We first employed high resolution NMR to verify the pathway used by a pure culture of Bifidobacterium bifidum. The major products of fermentation of 1- and 3-13C-glucose were acetate and lactate. Most of the 13C from 3-13C-glucose was in 13CH313COOH with equal enrichment in the methyl and carboxyl groups. The 13C-acetate from 1-13C-glucose was almost entirely enriched in the methyl of acetate and no 13CH313COOH was produced. NMR analysis of glucose fermentation by the colonic flora of a 158-d-old strictly breast-fed infant showed production of 13CH313COOH from 3-13C-glucose. The amount of 13CH313COOH formed established that the Bifidobacterium pathway was the major pathway used for glucose fermentation by this infant's colonic microbes.

TI  - Temperature dependence of histidine ionization constants in myoglobin.  
AB  - The standard enthalpy of ionization of six titratable histidines in horse metaquomyoglobin was determined by repeating proton NMR titrations as a function of temperature and using the van't Hoff relationship. It was found that deltaH degrees varies between 16 and 37 kJ mol(-1) in the protein, compared with a value of 29 kJ mol(-1) in free histidine. The standard entropy change was evaluated by combining the enthalpy and free energy changes derived from the pKa values. Although the entropy change could not be precisely and accurately obtained by this method, it could be established that it spans a wide range, from -60 to 0 J K(-1) mol(-1), about the value of -23 J K(-1) mol(-1) for the free histidine. The entropy change was used within the framework of enthalpy-entropy compensation to partition the solvation component from the standard thermodynamic quantities for each of the titrating residues. It was shown that the partitioning of the values in the protein is not readily understood in terms of solvent accessibility or electrostatic interactions. The contribution of solvation effects to the temperature response appeared to be significant only in the case of His-119 and His-48. The standard quantities were also used to explore the energetics of proton binding in the native state at temperatures below the onset of thermal denaturation.

TI  - Mechanisms of nitroso compound-induced inhibition of superoxide generation in neutrophils: fluorescence quenching of perylene by nitroso-compounds in the membrane fractions of neutrophils.  
AB  - To investigate the mechanism of nitroso compound-induced inhibition of the respiratory burst in neutrophils, we studied fluorescence quenching of perylene by nitroso-compounds in the membrane fractions of neutrophils at 17, 27, and 37 degrees C and the reagent-induced inhibition of superoxide generation at 28 and 37 degrees C. With increasing temperature, the quenching of perylene fluorescence and inhibition of superoxide generation by nitrosobenzene (NB) were both diminished, while those by 2-nitrosotoluene (NT) were both enhanced. The temperature dependence of the inhibition constants and the quenching constants indicates that the binding of NB is exothermic (deltaH= -27 kJ/mol for inhibition and deltaH= -29 kJ/mol for quenching) and essentially enthalpy-driven. On the other hand, that of NT is endothermic (deltaH= +16 kJ/mol for inhibition and quenching) and essentially entropy-driven. Quenching studies of perylene fluorescence in synthetic vesicles made of endogenous polar lipids of neutrophils showed that the enthalpy changes of NB- and NT-binding with perylene in lipids were similar to each other. Moreover, their values were in good agreement with that of NT, but not of NB, in the membrane fractions, an assembly of proteins and lipids, of neutrophils. These results suggest that NB inhibits the activity by binding to proteins in the membrane, whereas inhibition by NT occurs through hydrophobic interaction with lipids and/or proteins.

TI  - Amination of tyrosine in liver cytosol protein of male F344 rats treated with 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane, or acetoxime.  
AB  - Previously, the secondary nitroalkane 2-nitropropane, a strong hepatocarcinogen in rats, had been shown to induce the formation of 8-aminoguanine in both DNA and RNA of rat liver through a sulfotransferase-mediated pathway. This pathway was postulated to convert the carcinogen into an aminating species [Sodum, R. S., et al. (1994) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 7, 344-351]. To submit this postulate to further test, we examined liver proteins of rats treated with 2-nitropropane, other carcinogenic secondary nitroalkanes, or the related rat liver tumorigen acetoxime for the presence of 3-aminotyrosine, the expected product of tyrosine amination. Using ion-pair and/or cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, we found that the liver cytosolic proteins of these animals contained 0.1-1.5 mol of 3-aminotyrosine/10(3) mol of tyrosine. Treatment with the noncarcinogenic primary nitroalkane 1-nitropropane or with other primary nitroalkanes did not produce an analogous increase in the aminated amino acid (level of detection estimated at approximately 0.01 mol/10(3) mol of tyrosine). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the modification of protein tyrosine in vivo by a carcinogen. In vitro studies with acetoxime-O-sulfonate and hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate showed that these proposed intermediates in the activation pathway of 2-nitropropane react with guanosine to give 8-aminoguanosine, N1-aminoguanosine, and 8-oxoguanosine and also react with tyrosine to give 3-aminotyrosine and 3-hydroxytyrosine. The in vitro amination and oxidation of guanosine at C8 were also produced by acetophenoxime-O-sulfonate and 2-heptanoxime-O-sulfonate. These results provide additional evidence for the production of a reactive species capable of aminating nucleic acids and proteins from 2-nitropropane and other carcinogenic secondary nitroalkanes by a pathway involving oxime- and hydroxylamine-O-sulfonates as intermediates.

TI  - Secondary structure determination of 15N-labelled human Long-[Arg-3]-insulin-like growth factor 1 by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.  
AB  - Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are a group of proteins that promote cell growth and differentiation. Long-[Arg-3]-IGF-I (Francis et al. (1992) J. Mol. Endocrinol. 8, 213-223), a potent analogue of IGF-I, which has a Glu-3 to Arg-3 substitution and a hydrophobic, thirteen amino acid N-terminal extension, has been studied by 1H,15N NMR spectroscopy. All the backbone 1H and 15N assignments and most of the 1H sidechain assignments have been completed. The secondary structure elements were identified by determining the sequential and medium range NOEs from sensitivity-enhanced 15N-NOESY-HSQC and sensitivity-enhanced 15N-HSQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra. The IGF-I domain of Long-[Arg-3]-IGF-I was found to have an almost identical structure to IGF-I. The N-terminal seven amino acid residues of the extension have very few medium range or long range NOEs but the next five amino acids form a turn-like structure that is spatially close to the beginning of helix 1 in the IGF-I domain. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments show that all the slowly exchanging backbone amide protons in the IGF-I domain are either in the helical or the extended structural elements. Many of the amide protons in the N-terminal extension are also protected from the solvent although the residues in this part of the extension do not have any identifiable secondary structure. The results are interpreted in terms of the increased biological potency of Long-[Arg-3]-IGF-I and the decreased binding to insulin-like growth factor binding proteins.

The process has been found to be reversible in the pH range from 6.4 to 8.3 in the absence of oxygen.

This mutant exhibits similar reversibility, but has a slightly lower transition temperature.

TI  - 20-HETE relaxes bovine coronary arteries through the release of prostacyclin.  
AB  - Neutrophils respond to ischemic injury by infiltrating the myocardium via the vascular wall. During this process, neutrophils are activated and release inflammatory mediators. Some of these mediators are metabolites of arachidonic acid. We have reported that neutrophils metabolize arachidonic acid to 20-HETE, a cytochrome P450 metabolite. We investigated the effects of 20-HETE on coronary vascular tone by examining 20-HETE-induced changes in isometric tension in bovine coronary artery rings precontracted with the thromboxane-mimetic, U46619. 20-HETE relaxed precontracted coronary rings in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 of 3 x 10(-7) mol/L). Pretreatment with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, shifted the concentration-response curve to the right (EC50 of 1 x 10(-6) mol/L); maximal relaxations were not affected. This suggested that 20-HETE-induced relaxations were, in part, dependent on the cyclooxygenase pathway. Relaxations to 20-HETE were not significantly changed in endothelium-denuded rings. To determine whether metabolism of 20-HETE to a vasoactive compound might explain the relaxations caused by 20-HETE, rings of coronary artery were incubated with [3H] 20-HETE. The incubation buffer was extracted and the [3H] products resolved on reverse-phase HPLC. Both denuded and intact arteries failed to metabolize [3H] 20-HETE. To investigate whether 20-HETE-induced relaxations were related to release of prostacyclin, we measured the release of 6-keto PGF1alpha, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, from bovine coronary arteries. 20-HETE (1 x 10(-6) mol/L) stimulated an increase in 6-keto PGF1alpha in intact vessels (908 +/- 138 pg/mL versus 1402 +/- 157 pg/mL, basal versus stimulated). Thus, 20-HETE-induced relaxations are due, in part, to the stimulation of the release of the dilatory prostanoid, prostacyclin.

TI  - Adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to the immediate-early gene product Cyr61 is mediated through integrin alphavbeta3.  
AB  - Cyr61 is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products thought to act cooperatively with the activities of growth factors. Upon synthesis, Cyr61 is secreted and is predominantly incorporated into the extracellular matrix. Recently, we demonstrated that Cyr61 promotes cell adhesion and migration and augments growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (Kireeva, M. L., Mo, F.-E., Yang, G. P., and Lau, L. F. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 1326-1334). In the present study, we investigated possible candidate receptor(s) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) mediating adhesion to Cyr61. Under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions, adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 was dose-dependent, saturable, and abolished by affinity-purified anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Cell adhesion to Cyr61 was divalent cation-dependent and specifically inhibited by the peptide RGDS and LM609, a monoclonal antibody against integrin alphavbeta3. Furthermore, purified alphavbeta3 bound directly to an affinity matrix of Cyr61-coupled Sepharose 4B, and this interaction was specifically blocked by anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Additionally, in a solid phase binding assay, soluble Cyr61 bound to immobilized alphavbeta3 in a dose-dependent manner, and half-saturation binding occurred at approximately 5 nM Cyr61. As expected, the interaction of Cyr61 with immobilized alphavbeta3 was blocked by RGDS and LM609. In sum, these results identified Cyr61 as a novel ligand for alphavbeta3 and indicate that the adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 is mediated through interaction with this integrin. The possibility that integrin alphavbeta3 functions as a signaling receptor for Cyr61 accounts for most if not all activities that can be ascribed to Cyr61 to date and suggests a mechanism of action discussed herein.

TI  - Physicochemical characterization of nedocromil bivalent metal salt hydrates. 3. Nedocromil calcium.  
AB  - A crystalline pentahydrate and a crystalline 8/3 hydrate of nedocromil calcium (NC) were prepared. The relationships between these solid phases and the nature of the water interactions in their structures were studied through characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Karl Fischer titrimetry (KFT), hot-stage microscopy (HSM), ambient- or variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, water uptake at various relative humidities (RH), intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) and solubility measurements. The solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate of the pentahydrate in water at 25 degrees C are approximately 17% greater than the corresponding values for the 8/3 hydrate, corresponding to a greater Gibbs free energy of only 380 J.mol-1 (91 cal.mol-1) for the pentahydrate. The results of DSC, TGA, and FTIR and SSNMR spectroscopy indicate that the water of hydration is more loosely bound in the pentahydrate than in the 8/3 hydrate. On increasing the temperature in open-pan DSC and TGA, the water in the pentahydrate is released in four steps (three steps in crimped pans), whereas the water in the 8/3 hydrate is released in three steps (three steps also in crimped pans). These three stepwise dehydrations are fundamentally explained by their different water environments in the crystal structure of the 8/3 hydrate, which was determined by single-crystal XRD [crystal data: triclinic, space group P1, a = 13.2381(3) A, b = 13.3650(2) A, c = 17.8224(2) A, alpha = 68.202(1) degrees, beta = 86.894(1) degrees, gamma = 82.969(1) degrees, Z = 6]. The asymmetric unit contains three nedocromil anions and three calcium cations associated with eight water molecules. The nedocromil anions act as polyfunctional ligands to the Ca2+ ions, coordinating through both the carbonyl oxygen and the carboxylate oxygen atoms. The molecular conformations of the three nedocromil anions in the asymmetric unit are almost identical. However, the crystal structure contains two different calcium environments, one of which has the Ca2+ ion hydrated by four water molecules in the equatorial plane and by two carbonyl oxygens in its axial coordination sites. In the second environment, the Ca2+ ion has four carboxylate oxygen atoms in its equatorial plane and two water molecules in its axial coordination sites. Two of the carboxylate ligands are twisted out of the tricyclic ring, and the other two carboxylate ligands are nearly coplanar with the tricyclic ring. All of the eight water molecules in the 8/3 hydrate are linked to calcium and carboxylate ions and none are linked to other water molecules.

Albendazole (EC50 range: not achieved-2 x 10(-6) mol/L) and omeprazole (EC50 range: 2-4 x 10(-5) mol/L) were the most effective benzimidazoles. The activity of albendazole was pH dependent, as was that of chloroquine, and variable. Albendazole has its primary mode of action on trophozoites, suggesting that the drug may target parasite tubulin polymerization. Omeprazole, although also primarily effective against trophozoites, had additional activity against schizonts and ring forms, suggesting a distinct or additional parasitic target. Given the variable activity of albendazole and its rapid metabolism in vivo into compounds with even less antimalarial activity, it appears unlikely that this benzimidazole will be useful in the treatment of malaria. The rapid activity and different stage-specific profile of the more soluble benzimidazole omeprazole warrants further investigation.

TI  - [Roughness of the globular protein surface]  
AB  - The area and volume of the approximating ellipsoids taken from low resolution X-ray data have been calculated for 65 globular proteins. It has been shown that the dependence of these values on the protein molecular mass (M) coincides with those for even isometric bodies. This indicates that the asymmetry of globular proteins does not grow with the increase of their sizes. At the same time the 0.73 slope of the log-log dependence of the accessible surface area (A(s)) on the protein molecular mass differing from the value of 0.67 for even isometric bodies was observed (Miller S. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 1987. V.196. P.641). This can be explained by peculiarities of the protein surface. The method of molecule shape recovery by spherical harmonics has shown that the domain organization of protein molecule cannot explain the observed difference. Therefore the more detailed analysis of protein surface structure would be necessary.

TI  - Quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of sperm specific LDH by optical isomers of gossypol.  
AB  - Intrinsic fluorescence of LDH-C4 has been studied in the presence of optical isomers of gossypol. The study showed that fluorescence due to tryptophan residues after excitation of LDH at 282 nm is quenched by each gossypol enantiomere in a concentration dependent manner. Half of the maximum quench (Q50%) of enzyme occurred with gossypol (-) at 0.9 x 10(-4) mol/l and with gossypol (+) at 1.4 x 10(-4) mol/l showing a maximum quench (Qmax) of 45% and 65% respectively, with a corresponding association constant (Ka) of 1.0 x 10(4) l/mol and 0.4 x 10(4) l/mol. Stern-Volmer constant (Ksv) inferred that quenching of LDH comprises at least two components with two different Ksv values. Ksv(I) and Ksv(II) between LDH-C4 and gossypol (-) were 1.97 x 10(3) l/mol and 1.22 x 10(3) l/mol, and those between LDH-C4 and gossypol(+) were 2.3 x 10(3) l/mol and 1.56 x 10(3) l/mol. Smaller Ksv at higher concentrations of gossypol indicated that some of the tryptophan residues in LDH-C4 are deeply buried within a hydrophobic environment. There was no blue or red shift of LDH-C4 when interacting with either of the gossypol enantiomeres.

TI  - The effect of hepatocyte enlargement on the hemodynamic characteristics of the isolated perfused rat liver preparation.  
AB  - The influence of hepatocyte enlargement on intrahepatic hemodynamics was assessed in the isolated perfused rat liver preparation (IPRL) using two experimental models: hypotonic liver cell swelling and phenobarbitone-induced hepatocyte hypertrophy. The analysis of pressure-flow data obtained from the portal vascular bed over a flow range of 0 to 70 mL/min in the presence of a maximally-effective concentration of the vasodilator agent papaverine hydrochloride (6 x 10(-4) mol/L) enabled the calculation of P0, an estimate of the pressure required to passively distend the intrahepatic vasculature, and Gmax, the maximal portal vascular conductance. By comparison with an isotonic perfusion medium (Krebs-Henseleit buffer [KH] containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA]), perfusion with a hypotonic medium induced a significant increase in mean hepatocyte cross-sectional area (H(A)) (590 +/- 21 vs. 324 +/- 23 microm(-2), p < .05), a fall in Gmax (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.02 +/- 0.18 mL/min/g/mm hg, P < .001), and an increase in P0 (2.96 +/- 0.38 vs. 1.58 +/- 0.07 mm hg, P < .001). Phenobarbitone administered in drinking water (0.5 g/L) over a period of 60 days also induced a significant degree of hepatocyte enlargement (HA, 510 +/- 29 microm2, P < .05). On day 7, portal pressure measured in vivo in this group was significantly elevated compared with untreated controls (10.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.4 +/- 0.2 mm hg, P < .001), while in the IPRL Gmax was reduced (0.48 +/- 0.01 mL/min/g/mm hg, P < .001), and P0 was increased (2.23 +/- 0.17 mm hg, P < .05). However, with continued phenobarbitone treatment portal pressure, Gmax and P0 returned toward control values. The results confirm that hepatocyte enlargement is associated with a significant disturbance of intrahepatic hemodynamics but also that some adaptation occurs if hepatocyte enlargement is sustained over a prolonged period of time.

TI  - Ultratight DNA binding of a new bisintercalating anthracycline antibiotic.  
AB  - Differential scanning calorimetry and absorption spectroscopy were used to characterize the interaction of the new bisintercalating anthracycline antibiotic, WP631, with DNA. The method of continuous variations revealed five distinct binding modes for WP631, corresponding to 6, 3, 1.3, 0.5, and 0.25 mol of base pairs (bp) per mole of ligand. The binding of one drug to 6 bp corresponds to the bisintercalative binding mode determined previously, and was the mode studied in detail. UV melting experiments and differential scanning calorimetry were used to measure the ultratight binding of WP631 to DNA. The binding constant for the interaction of WP631 with herring sperm DNA was determined to be 3.1 (+/- 0.2) x 10(11) M-1 at 20 degrees C. The large, favorable binding free energy of -15.3 kcal mol-1 was found to result from a large, negative enthalpic contribution of -30.2 kcal mol-1. DNA melting curves at different concentrations of WP631 were fitted to McGhee's model of DNA melting in the presence of ligands, yielding an independent estimate of DNA binding parameters. The salt dependence of the WP631 binding constant was examined, yielding a slope SK = delta (log K)/delta (log[Na+]) = 1.63. The observed salt dependence of the equilibrium constant, interpreted according to polyelectrolyte theory, indicates that there is a significant nonpolyelectrolyte contribution to the binding free energy. DNA melting studies using a homogeneous 214 bp DNA fragment showed that WP631 binds preferentially to the GC-rich region of the DNA.

These data, combined with five literature sequences, were used to derive nearest-neighbor thermodynamic parameters for seven linearly independent trimer sequences with internal G.A mismatches and Watson-Crick flanking base pairs. The G.A mismatch parameters predict DeltaG degrees 37, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS degrees, and TM with average deviations of 4.4%, 7.4%, 8.0%, and 1.5 degrees C, respectively. The nearest-neighbor parameters show that G.A mismatch stability is strongly context dependent, and DeltaG degrees 37 ranges from +1.16 kcal/mol for TGA/AAT to -0.78 kcal/mol for GGC/CAG. In addition, one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra show that the G.A pairing geometry is pH and context dependent.

TI  - Enzymological characterization of recombinant xenopus DG42, a vertebrate hyaluronan synthase.  
AB  - We have characterized the hyaluronan (HA) synthase activity of the Xenopus DG42 gene product in vitro. The recombinant enzyme produced in yeast does not possess a nascent HA chain and, therefore, is an ideal model system for kinetic studies of the synthase's glycosyltransferase activity. The enzymatic rate was optimal from pH 7.6 to 8.1. Only the authentic sugar nucleotide precursors, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), were utilized to produce a large molecular weight polymer. UDP-glucose or the galactose epimers of the normal substrates did not substitute. The Michaelis constant, Km, of recombinant DG42 in membranes was 60 +/- 20 and 235 +/- 40 microM for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively, which is comparable to values obtained previously from membranes derived from vertebrate cells. The apparent energy of activation for HA elongation is about 15 kilocalories/mol. DG42 polymerizes HA at average rates of about 80 to 110 monosaccharides/s in vitro. The resulting HA polysaccharide possessed molecular weights spanning 2 x 10(6)-10(7) Da, corresponding to about 10(4) sugar residues. This is the first report characterizing a defined eukaryotic enzyme that can produce a glycosaminoglycan.

TI  - Arginine vasopressin enhances sympathetic constriction through the V1 vasopressin receptor in human saphenous vein.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) not only acts directly on blood vessels through V1 receptor stimulation but also may modulate adrenergic-mediated responses in animal experiments in vivo and in vitro. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AVP can contribute to an abnormal adrenergic constrictor response of human saphenous veins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saphenous vein rings were obtained from 32 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The vein rings were suspended in organ bath chambers for isometric recording of tension. AVP (3x10[-9] mol/L) enhanced the contractions elicited by electrical field stimulation at 1, 2, and 4 Hz (by 80%, 70%, and 60%, respectively) and produced a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine (half-maximal effective concentration decreased from 6.87x10[-7] to 1.04x10[-7] mol/L; P<.05). The V1 vasopressin receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (10[-6] mol/L) prevented the potentiation evoked by AVP. The selective V1 receptor agonist [Phe,2 Orn8]-vasotocin (3x[-10]-9 mol/L) induced potentiation of electrical stimulation-evoked responses, which was also inhibited in the presence of the V1 receptor antagonist (10[-6] mol/L). In contrast, the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (10[-9] to 10[-7] mol/L) did not modify neurogenic responses, and the V2 receptor antagonist [d(CH2)5, D-Ile,2 Ile,4 Arg8]-vasopressin (10[-8] to 10[-6] mol/L) did not prevent the potentiation induced by AVP. The dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine (10[-6] mol/L) did not affect the potentiating effect of AVP. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low concentrations of AVP facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission and potentiate constrictor effects of norepinephrine in human saphenous veins. These effects appear to be mediated by V1 receptor stimulation and are independent of calcium entry through dihydropyridine calcium channels. Thus, AVP may contribute to vascular mechanisms involved in acute ischemic syndromes associated with venous grafts, particularly if the sympathetic nervous system is activated.

TI  - Free-energy simulations of the retinal cis --> trans isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin.  
AB  - Free-energy profiles for ground-state cis --> trans isomerization of retinal in vacuum, in solution, and in the protein bacteriorhodopsin are calculated using free-energy simulations. The free-energy barriers in the protein were 9 kcal/mol for ionized Asp85 and 14 kcal/mol for neutral Asp85, significantly lower than those found in solution (18 kcal/mol) or vacuum (19 kcal/mol). Therefore, bacteriorhodopsin can be said to act as a catalyst in the isomerization. The barrier in the protein is due mainly to stabilization of the transition state through favorable nonbonded interactions with the protein part of the system, with internal strain and interactions with solvent playing minor roles. The protonated Asp85 simulation models the behavior of the system in the N --> O transition. Our calculated 14 kcal/mol barrier and 4-ms relaxation time for this process are in excellent agreement with experimentally measured values of 12 kcal/mol and 5 ms, respectively. The ionized Asp85 simulation models two hypothetical processes: the N --> O transition with a proton removed from Asp85 and the initial BR568 --> L transition on the ground-state energy surface. The cis-trans isomerization barrier in this system is 9 kcal/mol, the lowest of all the studied cases. The presence of the charged carboxylate group in the ionized Asp85 system leads to strong stabilization of the transition state by interactions with the surroundings and changes the distance between Asp85 and the Schiff base proton compared to the corresponding distance in the neutral Asp85 system. This suggests that the protonation of Asp85 plays an important role in regulating access to the Schiff base proton. For both Asp85 ionization states the calculated cis-trans free-energy difference was close to 0, indicating that the protein can accommodate both retinal isomers equally well. The computed negligible difference between the N and O free-energy levels is in accord with experimental data.

TI  - Superoxide-mediated decomposition of biological S-nitrosothiols.  
AB  - Incubation of S-nitrosocysteine or S-nitrosoglutathione (5-100 M) in the presence of a generator of superoxide (xanthine/xanthine oxidase) resulted in a time-dependent decomposition of S-nitrosothiols and accumulation of nitrite/nitrate in reaction mixtures. Quantitatively, the amounts of nitrite/nitrate represented >90% of nitrosonium equivalent of S-nitrosothiols degraded during the incubation. The reaction rates were unaffected by the presence catalase (1 unit/ml). Kinetic analysis showed that the degradation of S-nitrosothiols in the presence of superoxide proceeded at second order rate constants of 76,900 M-1 s-1 (S-nitrosocysteine) and 12,800 M-1 s-1 (S-nitrosoglutathione), respectively, with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 mol of S-nitrosothiol per 2 mol of superoxide. The findings provide the evidence for the involvement of superoxide in the metabolism of S-nitrosothiols. Furthermore, substantially slower reaction rates of superoxide with S-nitrosothiols relative to the reaction rate with NO are consistent with the contention that the transient formation of S-nitrosothiols in biological systems may protect NO from its rapid destruction by superoxide, thus enabling these compounds to serve as carriers or buffers of NO.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glycated GIP (glucitol adduct of GIP) on glucose uptake and metabolism in muscle. Glycated GIP (molecular mass 5147.2 Da) was purified by HPLC following in vitro incubation under hyperglycaemic reducing conditions (24 h at pH 7.4). GIP (10(-10)-10(-8) mol/l) significantly stimulated (1.4- to 1.5-fold, P < 0.001) 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose uptake in abdominal muscle pieces from 3- to 5-week-old lean mice compared with control incubations (without GIP). This stimulatory effect on glucose uptake at 10(-10)-10(-9) mol/l was decreased by 13-20% following glycation of the peptide (P < 0.05). GIP (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l) induced a stepwise 1.4- to 1.7-fold increase (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 respectively) in [14C]glucose oxidation compared with controls. This effect on glucose oxidation was diminished by 32% with 10(-8) mol/l glycated GIP (P < 0.05). GIP (10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l) induced a 1.4- to 1.8-fold increase in [14C]glucose incorporation into muscle glycogen (glycogenesis) compared with controls. Glycated GIP (10(-8) mol/l) exhibited a 41% decrease in glycogenic activity (P < 0.01). GIP (10(-10)-10(-8) mol/l) stimulated lactate production in isolated abdominal muscle (1.2- to 1.3-fold, P < 0.05); however glycated GIP did not exert a significant effect. This study demonstrates for the first time that GIP promotes glucose uptake, glucose oxidation and glycogenesis in muscle tissue. Furthermore, modification of GIP through glycation diminishes its biological effectiveness.

TI  - Active sites residues of beef liver carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-II).  
AB  - The carnitine acyltransferases which catalyse the reversible transfer of fatty acyl groups between carnitine and coenzyme A have been proposed to contain a catalytic histidine. Here, the chemical reactivity of active site groups has been used to demonstrate differences between the active sites of beef liver carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II (CPT-II). Treatment of CPT-II with the histidine-selective reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), resulted in simple linear pseudo-first-order kinetics. The reversal of the inhibition by hydroxylamine and the pKa (7.1) of the modified residue indicated that the residue was a histidine. The order of the inactivation kinetics showed that 1mol of histidine was modified per mol of CPT-II.When COT was treated with DEPC the kinetics of inhibition were biphasic with an initial rapid loss of activity followed by a slower loss of activity. The residue reacting in the faster phase of inhibition was not a histidine but possibly a serine. The modification of this residue did not lead to complete loss of activity suggesting that a direct role in catalysis is unlikely. It was deduced that the residue modified by DEPC in the slower phase was a lysine and indeed fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) inactivated COT with linear pseudo-first-order kinetics. The COT peptide containing the FDNB-labelled lysine was isolated and sequenced. Alignment of this sequence placed it 10 amino acids downstream of the putative active-site histidine.

TI  - Can O=NOOH undergo homolysis?  
AB  - Recent thermodynamic calculations of Merenyi and Lind [(1997) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 10, 1216-1220] suggest that O=NOOH can undergo homolysis to form the hydroxyl radical and nitrogen dioxide. This result is based in part on our statement that the enthalpy of ionization of O=NOOH is close to zero [Koppenol et al. (1992) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 5, 834-842]. As the ionization of O=NOOH is sensitive to the milieu and the rate of isomerization (to nitrate) to the total concentration of O=NOOH and O=NOO- [Kissner et al. (1997) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 10, 1285-1292], we reinvestigated the temperature dependence of the ionization constant and determined a deltaHo of 4+/-2 kcal mol(-1). This results in a standard Gibbs energy of homolysis of 16 kcal mol(-1) and a rate of homolysis of 1 x 10(-2) s[-1]. Given the uncertainty in the Gibbs energy of homolysis, upper and lower rates are 1 x 10(-4) and 0.6 s(-1), slower than the rate of isomerization, 1.2 s(-1) at 25 degrees C. The recombination of the homolysis products NO2. and HO. is known to lead to mainly peroxynitrous acid. If one assumes that a few percent of the recombinations lead to nitrate instead, then the rate of homolysis must be much higher than the rate of isomerization. We conclude therefore that homolysis is unlikely.

TI  - Bradykinin potentiates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and enhances insulin signal through the bradykinin B2 receptor in dog skeletal muscle and rat L6 myoblasts.  
AB  - Previously we demonstrated that bradykinin infusion could increase glucose uptake into dog peripheral tissues, and that bradykinin could potentiate insulin-induced glucose uptake through glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in dog adipocytes. However, skeletal muscle is the predominant tissue for insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The aim of this study was to determine how bradykinin affected insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in dog skeletal muscle and myotubes transformed from rat L6 myoblasts. The bradykinin receptor binding studies revealed that dog skeletal muscle and rat L6 myoblasts possessed significant numbers of bradykinin receptors (Kd = 88 and 76 pmol/l, Bmax = 82.5 and 20 fmol/mg protein respectively). An RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) amplification showed mRNA specific for bradykinin B2 receptor in both cells. Bradykinin significantly increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated muscle and L6 myoblasts in the presence of insulin (10(-7) mol/l) in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the absence of insulin. Bradykinin also enhanced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta subunit and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) without affecting the binding affinities or numbers of cell surface insulin receptors in both cells. It is concluded that bradykinin could potentiate the insulin-induced glucose uptake through GLUT4 translocation in dog skeletal muscle and rat L6 myoblasts. This effect could be explained by the potency of bradykinin to upregulate the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity which stimulates phosphorylation of IRS-1, followed by an increase in GLUT4 translocation.

TI  - Effects of chronic central infusion of oxytocin on the response of the magnocellular neuroendocrine system to osmotic stimulation.  
AB  - The effect of continuous intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of oxytocin (OT) on the release of OT and vasopressin (VP) following osmotic stimulation was studied in ovariectomized rats treated peripherally with gonadal steroids to simulate late gestation/lactation. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with or without OT (2 ng/microg) was infused (0.5 microl/h) i.c.v. continuously for 7 days along with sequential peripheral administration of progesterone (2 mg/kg i.m.) for 4 days, then 17-beta-estradiol (200 microg/kg i.m.) for 2 days. Following 7 days of OT infusion, isotonic (0.15 mol/l NaCl) or hypertonic (1.5 mol/l NaCl) saline was injected (15 ml/kg s.c.); the animals were decapitated 1 h later. Animals infused centrally with OT had higher basal levels of OT in plasma (p < 0.01 vs. CSF). While osmotic stimulation increased plasma levels of both OT and VP (0.15 mol/l NaCl < 1.5 mol/l NaCl; p < 0.01), only circulating VP was enhanced further (p < 0.01) in animals infused with OT compared with those receiving CSF. These changes in hormone levels could not be explained by differences in neural lobe stores of OT or VP or by alterations in daily water intake during the infusion period. Thus, chronic i.c.v. infusion of OT stimulates basal release of OT and increases the response of the VP system to osmotic stimulation.

TI  - Energy minimization of globular proteins with solvent effects included. Comparison of empirical solvation energy terms and explicit water treatment.  
AB  - The effect of an empirical solvation energy term on energy minimization of ribonuclease T1 was established using different sets of Atomic Solvation Parameters. The results are compared to minimization in vacuo and in a 10 A water shell. The best solvent model as judged from the comparison to the crystal structure was an empirical solvation potential derived from free energies of transfer of amino-acid side-chain analogues from vapour to water. The use of this model causes, however, energy and gradient oscillations, which make it inapplicable with standard protocols of molecular dynamics simulations. The empirical solvation model which was found by other authors (von Freyberg et al., 1993, J. Mol. Biol. 233, 275-292) to give good results in the NMR structure refinement led to distortions of the ribonuclease native structure. The model based on statistical analysis of crystal structures did not perform better than minimization in vacuo.

TI  - Probing DNA-cationic lipid interactions with the fluorophore trimethylammonium diphenyl-hexatriene (TMADPH).  
AB  - The aim of this study is to get a better understanding of DNA-cationic lipid complex formation and its characterization through the properties of the lipid assembly, using fluorescent probes known to have different locations in the vesicle bilayer, 1,6-diphenylhexa-1,3,5-triene (DPH) and 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMADPH). The location of these two fluorescent probes in the membrane differs; the positive charge of TMADPH is localized close to the water/lipid interface and its fluorophore is present in the upper part of the acyl chain region while DPH (lacking polar group) is embedded deeper in the hydrophobic part of the bilayer. Unilamellar vesicles ( approximately 100 nm size) composed of N-(1-(2, 3-dioleoyloxy)-propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) as a helper lipid (at 1 : 1 mole ratio) were used as a model of cationic liposomes. Both linear and circular DNA gave almost identical results. DNA-/L+ (mole charge ratio of DNA negatively-charged phosphate to positively-charged lipid) ratios have large effects on the measured parameters. The effects monitored through TMADPH are much more striking than those obtained through the use of DPH, suggesting that the major DNA-lipid interaction occurs at the lipid/water interface. The fact that DNA induced much larger changes in TMADPH fluorescence intensity in H2O than in D2O suggests that the changes in the exposure of TMADPH to water and solvent relaxation effects are involved in the interaction. At DNA-/L+>/=1, fluorescence intensity increased concomitantly with a small increase in TMADPH fluorescence anisotropy without much affect in the size of the complex. At DNA-/L+<0.6, fluorescence quenching proportional to DNA-/L+ occurred, as well as a large increase in TMADPH fluorescence anisotropy and in complex size. These results suggest that at low DNA-/L+, negatively-charged DNA condenses positively-charged lipid headgroups, thereby inducing formation of lipid-ordered domains. This phase separation results in membrane defects at the lipid/water interface and increased exposure of the hydrophobic upper parts of the acyl chains to water, as indicated by the quenching of TMADPH. This leads to instability and aggregation/fusion of the DNA-lipid complexes. On the other hand, at DNA-/L+>/=1, the condensing effect is smaller, involving homogeneous lateral condensation of all the lipids, leading to a reduction in water content near the probe, and the DNA-lipid complexes are relatively small and stable.

TI  - Irreversible thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase from Escherichia coli K-12.  
AB  - Thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase from Escherichia coli K-12 has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The excess heat capacity vs. temperature profiles were obtained at temperature scanning rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 K/min. These profiles were analysed using three models of irreversible denaturation which are approximations to the whole Lumry-Eyring model, namely, the one-step model of irreversible denaturation, the Lumry-Eyring model with the fast equilibrating first step, and the model involving two consecutive irreversible steps. In terms of statistics the latter model describes the kinetics of thermal denaturation of uridine phosphorylase more satisfactorily than the two other models. The values of energy activation for the first and second steps calculated for the model involving two consecutive irreversible steps are the following: Ea,1 = 609.3 +/- 1.8 kJ/mol and Ea,2 = 446.8 +/- 3.2 kJ/mol.

TI  - Identification and partial characterization of factor Va heavy chain kinase from human platelets.  
AB  - Factor Va, the essential cofactor for prothrombinase, is phosphorylated on the acidic COOH terminus of the heavy chain of the cofactor, at Ser692, by a platelet membrane-associated casein kinase II (CKII). Consistent with this observation, phosphorylation of the factor Va heavy chain by the platelet kinase was inhibited by heparin. The membrane-associated platelet CKII kinase was partially purified using heparin-agarose, phosphocellulose, and ion exchange chromatography. CKII antigen was monitored using a polyclonal antibody to the alpha-subunit, and kinase activity in the various fractions was confirmed using human factor Va as a substrate. Immunoblotting experiments using polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides mimicking a portion of the deduced amino acid sequence of the alpha-, alpha'-, and beta-subunits of human CKII demonstrated the coexistence of both alpha- and alpha'-subunits in platelets and suggested that the platelet CKII kinase may exist in part as an alpha alpha'beta2 complex. It is also possible that there are two distinct populations of CKII in platelets, one that is alphaalpha/betabeta and one that is alpha'alpha'/betabeta. In the presence of the purified platelet-derived CKII, human factor Va incorporates between 0.8 and 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of factor Va depending on the concentration of the beta-subunit in the kinase preparation. A peptide mimicking the sequence 687-705 of the human factor V molecule incorporates radioactivity in the presence of purified CKII and inhibits factor Va heavy chain phosphorylation by the platelet CKII. In contrast, a peptide with an alanine instead of a serine at position 692 neither incorporates phosphate nor inhibits factor Va phosphorylation by the platelet CKII. Human factor Va is inactivated by activated protein C following three cleavages of the heavy chain at Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679. Cleavage at Arg506 is necessary for efficient exposure of the inactivating cleavage site at Arg306. The phosphorylated cofactor has increased susceptibility to inactivation by activated protein C, since phosphorylated factor Va was found to be inactivated approximately 3-fold faster than its native counterpart. Acceleration of the inactivation process of the phosphorylated cofactor occurs because of acceleration of the rate of cleavage at Arg506. These data suggest a critical role for factor Va phosphorylation on the surface of platelets in regulating cofactor activity.

TI  - Cell-specific differences in the susceptibility of potential cellular targets of human origin derived from blood and lung following treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).  
AB  - The induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A1) enzyme activity is one of the best-studied direct effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds and has been shown to be a sensitive biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in different experimental animal species as well as in humans. TCDD has also been shown to modulate cytokine gene expression in human keratinocytes, including IL-1 beta, TGF-alpha and TFG-beta 2. In the present studies, the aim was to determine whether different cellular targets of human origin differed in susceptibility to TCDD as measured by CYP1A1 activity and mRNA expression, and whether cytokine gene induction/suppression correlated with TCDD susceptibility. Human airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages (AM), peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes (PBL) were exposed to 10(-10)-10(-7) mol/L TCDD. CYP1A1 enzyme activity was determined by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, mRNA expression of CYP1A1 was measured by semiquantitative PCR assay. The secretion and/or gene expression of specific cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1 beta were also examined. Overall, there was a clear correlation between TCDD-induced enzyme activity and CYP1A1 mRNA levels, which were dose-dependently increased in the bronchoepithelial cells and PBL. The human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-S6 cell line and primary cells) appeared to be the most inducible cellular target, with up to 50-fold increases at 10(-8) mol/L TCDD with an EC50 of 3 x 10(-11) mol/L TCDD. The pokeweed mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed approximately 5-fold less capacity in CYP1A1 activity, with high interindividual variabilities (EC50 3 x 10(-9) mol/L TCDD). In contrast, CYP1A1 enzyme activity in both AM and purified peripheral blood monocytes, which were costimulated with LPS and/or GM-CSF, could not be detected. CYP1A1 mRNA levels, however, were detectable and only marginally enhanced in response to TCDD. The ability of all these cells to express and produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 was neither enhanced nor impaired by TCDD. These results indicate that cell types found in human lung and peripheral blood vary in susceptibility to TCDD, with the lung epithelium being highly susceptible and the alveolar macrophage being nonsusceptible. However, expression and production of specific cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8, which may potentiate inflammatory processes and/or work as mitogens, does not appear to be influenced by TCDD.

TI  - Purification and characterization of membrane-bound semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) from bovine lung.  
AB  - Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) has been purified from bovine lung microsomes in a form which is catalytically active and stable to storage. The enzyme, an integral membrane protein, was solubilized with Triton X-100 and purification was achieved, in the presence of detergent, by chromatography with Cibacron Blue 3GA-agarose, hydroxylapatite, Lens culinaris-agarose, Resource Q-FPLC and gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR-FPLC. This is the first reported procedure for the extensive purification of a membrane-bound SSAO. The purified enzyme had an apparent Mr of 400000 but exhibited microheterogeneity with SDS/PAGE and isoelectric focusing, probably as a result of its glycoprotein nature. It behaved as a tetramer with subunits with apparent Mr values of 100. Antibodies raised towards the purified enzyme cross-reacted with the enzymes from human lung and bovine plasma. Redox-cycling staining and reaction with carbonyl reagents were consistent with the presence of a quinone cofactor, possibly topa quinone. The enzyme was also shown to contain two mol of Cu/mol of enzyme and removal of half of this bound copper resulted essentially in complete inhibition of enzyme activity. In contrast to the reported behaviour of the SSAO enzymes from plasma, the bovine lung enzyme was relatively insensitive to inhibition by cyanide, copper-chelating agents and amiloride. The specificity of the bovine lung enzyme was also narrower than reported for soluble SSAO. It catalysed the oxidative deamination of benzylamine, methylamine, 2-phenylethylamine and histamine but had no significant activity towards dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, tryptamine or tyramine.

TI  - Pressure denaturation of proteins: evaluation of compressibility effects.  
AB  - One of the key pieces of information from pressure denaturation experiments is the standard volume change for unfolding (Delta V(o)). The pressure dependence of the volume change, the standard compressibility change (Delta K(o)T), is typically assumed to be zero in the analysis of these experiments. We show here that this assumption can be incorrect and that the neglect of compressibility differences can skew the interpretation of experimental results. Analysis of experimental, variable-pressure NMR data for bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A in 2H2O at pH 2.0 and 295 K yielded the following statistically significant, non-zero values: Delta K(o) T = 0.015 +/- 0.002 mL mol-1 bar-1, Delta V(o) = -21 +/- 2 mL mol-1, and Delta G(o) = 2.8 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1. The experimental protein stability is in good agreement with one (Delta G(o) = 2.5 kcal mol-1) determined independently for the same protein by calorimetry at atmospheric pressure under equivalent conditions [Makhatadze, G. I., Clore, G. M., and Gronenborn, A. M. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 852-855]. The positive value for Delta K(o)T indicates that the denatured form of ribonuclease A is more compressible than the native form; this is explained in terms of an interplay between the intrinsic compressibility of the protein and solvation effects. When the same data were fitted to a model that assumes a zero compressibility change, the Delta G(o) value of 4. 0 +/- 0.1 kcal mol-1 returned by the model no longer agreed with the independent measurement, and the Delta V(o) returned by the model was a very different -59 +/- 1 mL mol-1. By contrast, it was not possible to carry out a similar thermodynamic analysis of fluorescence spectroscopic data for the denaturation of staphylococcal nuclease to yield well-defined values of Delta G(o), Delta V(o), and Delta K(o)T. This limitation was shown by evaluation of synthetic data to be intrinsic to spectroscopic data whose analysis requires fitting of the plateaus at either side of the transition. Because NMR data do not have this requirement, they can be analyzed more rigorously.

TI  - Tumor suppressor p53 can participate in transcriptional induction of the GADD45 promoter in the absence of direct DNA binding [published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1998 Sep;18(9):5620]  
AB  - The GADD45 gene is a growth arrest-associated gene that is induced by certain DNA-damaging agents and other stresses, such as starvation, in all mammalian cells. In addition to a strong p53-binding element in an intronic sequence, we have recently found that p53, while not required or sufficient alone, may contribute to the stress responsiveness of the promoter. Much of the responsiveness was localized to a GC-rich motif in the proximal promoter which contains multiple Egr1 sites and a larger WT1 site; this 20-bp WT1 motif is identical to the WT1-binding site in the PDGF-A gene. In extracts from a human breast carcinoma cell line expressing p53 and WT1, which is known to associate with p53 in vivo, evidence was obtained that these proteins are in a complex that binds this 20-bp element. A combination of p53 and WT1 expression vectors strongly induced a GADD45-reporter construct, while mutation of the WT1-Egr1 site in the promoter prevented this induction. Abrogation of p53 function by a dominant-negative vector or abrogation of WT1 function by an antisense vector markedly reduced the induction of this promoter. Since p53 does not bind directly to the promoter, these results indicate that p53 can contribute to the positive regulation of a promoter by protein-protein interactions.

TI  - 31P-NMR analysis of congestive heart failure in the SHHF/Mcc-facp rat heart.  
AB  - 31P-NMR was used to monitor myocardial bioenergetics in compensated and failing SHHF/MCC-fa(cp) (SHF) rat hearts. The SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) (spontaneous hypertension and heart failure) rat is a relatively new genetic model in which all individuals spontaneously develop congestive heart failure, most during the second year of life. Failing SHF rat hearts displayed a pronounced decrease in resting PCr:ATP ratios (P<0.001), which was explained by a significant (P<0. 0001) drop in total creatine (47.2+/-3.1 nmol/mg protein) v age matched controls (106+/-3 nmol/mg protein). In end stage failure, NMR determined PCr was 2.9+/-0.1 micro mol/g wet weight under basal conditions. In contrast, 6- and 20-month-old controls and compensated SHFs had PCr values of 5.3+/-0.1, and 5.1+/-0.5 and 5. 1+/-0.2 micro mol/g wet weight. Both compensated and failing SHF hearts were metabolically compromised when the rate pressure product (RPP) was increased, as evidenced by an increase in Pi and a drop in PCr. Compensated SHF hearts, however, were able to increase rate pressure products (RRP, mmHg X beats/min) from 44.5+/-1.4 to 66.6+/-3. 4 K with dobutamine infusion, whereas hearts in end-stage failure were able to increase their RPP from baseline values of 27+/-4 K to only 37+/-7 K. The data indicate that a pronounced decline in PCr and total creatine signals the transition from compensatory hypertrophy to decompensation and failure in the SHF rat model of hypertensive cardiomyopathy.Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of the uterotonic agent oxytocin on intercellular communication between term pregnant human myometrial cells before labor were studied to investigate its contribution to the synchronicity of uterine contractions. STUDY DESIGN: The membrane potential and the input resistance of myometrial cells were measured with intracellular micropipettes, and dye-coupling assays were concomitantly performed while the tissues were perfused with three concentrations of oxytocin (10(-8) mol/L, 10(-7) mol/L, and 10(-6) mol/L). The results were compared with those obtained from tissues perfused with gap junctional uncoupling agent octanol and those with Tyrode's solution (control). RESULTS: Octanol increased input resistance and inhibited dye coupling but did not affect membrane potential compared with controls. Oxytocin depolarized membrane potential at all studied concentrations. The mean input resistance values and detectable dye propagation with oxytocin were similar to controls. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin does not contribute to gap junctional intercellular communication in term pregnant human myometrium before labor but may affect contractions by depolarizing membrane potential.

TI  - Interaction of triiodothyronine with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on interleukin-6-dependent osteoclast-like cell formation in mouse bone marrow cell cultures.  
AB  - In mouse bone marrow cultures, the formation of osteoclast-like, that is, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) and calcitonin (CT) receptor-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs), induced by 10(-10) to 10(-8) mol/L 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3], could be augmented by triiodothyronine (T3), which alone had no effect on osteoclast-like cell formation. The permissive effect of T3 increased the response to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by approximately one order of magnitude. Linear concentration dependence was observed between 10(-11) and 10(-8) mol/L T3. Importantly, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin significantly impeded osteoclast-like cell formation by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and abrogated the effect of T3 thereon. Basal interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by cultured marrow cells was significantly stimulated by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. However, even at an exceedingly high concentration of 20 ng/mL, IL-6 was ineffective in inducing osteoclast-like cell formation. Therefore, any hormonally induced rise in IL-6 release from bone marrow cells could not account for the observed changes in TRAP+ MNC numbers. Nevertheless, the stimulatory effect of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 on osteoclastogenesis was partially dependent on IL-6 because it could be significantly blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody, and to the same extent by a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody. Unimpaired signaling through the IL-6/IL-6R system is also a prerequisite for the auxiliary effect of T3 on induction of osteoclast-like cells by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. Our data provide evidence that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 induces osteoclast-like cell formation, at least in part, in an IL-6-dependent mode of action, which is also subject to modulation by T3. The mechanism of interaction of the two hormones apparently involves joint stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis.

TI  - Thermodynamic and structural consequences of flexible loop deletion by circular permutation in the streptavidin-biotin system.  
AB  - A circularly permuted streptavidin (CP51/46) has been designed to remove the flexible polypeptide loop that undergoes an open to closed conformational change when biotin is bound. The original termini have been joined by a tetrapeptide linker, and four loop residues have been removed, resulting in the creation of new N- and C-termini. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies show that the association constant has been reduced approximately six orders of magnitude below that of wild-type streptavidin to 10(7) M(-1). The deltaH degrees of biotin association for CP51/46 is reduced by 11.1 kcal/mol. Crystal structures of CP51/46 and its biotin complex show no significant alterations in the binding site upon removal of the loop. A hydrogen bond between Ser45 and Ser52 found in the absence of biotin is broken in the closed conformation as the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser45 moves to hydrogen bond to a ureido nitrogen of biotin. This is true in both the wild-type and CP51/46 forms of the protein, and the hydrogen bonding interaction might thus help nucleate closure of the loop. The reduced entropic cost of binding biotin to CP51/46 is consistent with the removal of this loop and a reduction in entropic costs associated with loop closure and immobilization. The reduced enthalpic contribution to the free energy of binding is not readily explainable in terms of the molecular structure, as the binding contacts are nearly entirely conserved, and only small differences in solvent accessible surfaces are observed relative to wild-type streptavidin.

TI  - A case of partial mole associated with trisomy 13.  
AB  - The majority of second-trimester partial moles are found in association with triploidy. Rarely are they associated with tetraploidy or other aneuploidies and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the prenatal diagnosis of partial mole in a pregnancy presenting with trisomy. The patient was referred at 21 weeks of gestation after a routine ultrasound examination had shown fetal and placental features suggesting a partial mole triploidy. Owing to the severe structural malformations and poor prognosis, the parents requested termination. Prenatal and postnatal cytogenetic investigations demonstrated an additional chromosome 13. Histopathological examination of the placenta showed focal areas of villous edema but no evidence of trophoblastic dysplasia. The maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin level was within the normal range at all times. This case shows that trisomy can resemble a triploid partial mole in utero without the potential long-term risk to the mother of persisting trophoblastic disease, as villous molar changes can obviously develop without trophoblastic dysplasia.

We determined parental origin by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, stage of development by gross and histological criteria, and partial molar status according to strict diagnostic criteria for all triploids identified amongst 1,054 consecutively karyotyped spontaneous abortions. Triploidy was detected in 64 of 832 successfully karyotyped specimens. Complete data were collected in 59 cases. Diandric origin was found in 39 specimens, and 20 of these fulfilled all four criteria for partial mole (trophoblast hyperplasia, dimorphic population of large and small villi, villous hydrops greater than 0.5 mm, and irregular villous contour). We separated the 19 diandric triploids not fulfilling all criteria for partial mole into four groups: specimens of early developmental stage, which we believed represented developing ("early") partial moles (n = 3), cases of late developmental stage, which we believed represented involuting ("ancient") partial moles (n = 4), cases showing some but not all criteria for partial mole (n = 7), and specimens with few if any criteria suggestive of partial mole (n = 5). In triploids of digynic origin (n = 20), developmental stage was significantly lower, fetal tissue was more frequently identified, and all specimens showed well-preserved fetal red blood cells. Digynic triploids occasionally showed irregular contour, dimorphic villi, and a mild form of trophoblast hyperplasia but never showed hydropic degeneration and were never suspicious for partial mole.

TI  - Identification of the subunit and important target peptides of pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase modified by the affinity label adenosine 5'-O-[S-(4-bromo-2, 3-dioxobutyl)thiophosphate].  
AB  - Pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is inactivated by adenosine 5'-O-[S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thiophosphate] (AMPS-BDB) with incorporation of 1.78 mol of reagent/mol of average subunit. Complete protection against the inactivation is provided by 20 mM isocitrate + 1 mM Mn2+, and the incorporation is decreased to about 1.3 mol of reagent/mol of average subunit. The addition of NAD, NADH, or Mn2+ alone has little effect on the functional changes produced by AMPS-BDB, while ADP gives only partial protection against the inactivation. The ability of ADP to decrease the Km for isocitrate is not affected by the AMPS-BDB modification of the enzyme. These results indicate that the isocitrate substrate site is the target of AMPS-BDB. The enzyme has three types of subunits with a tetramer having the composition alpha2 beta gamma. Here, [2-3H]AMPS-BDB-modified subunits are separated by HPLC on a C4 reverse-phase column, after the treatment of the modified enzyme with 4 M urea. The predominant radioactivity is distributed in alpha and gamma subunits. However, evidence based on recombination of subunits from modified and unmodified enzymes indicates that only labeling of the alpha subunit is responsible for inactivation by AMPS-BDB. Subsequently, the separated modified subunits were chemically cleaved by CNBr and then purified by HPLC using a C18 column. The labeled peptides were further digested by pepsin, purified by HPLC, and sequenced. These results indicate that R88 and R98 from the alpha subunit are the major targets of AMPS-BDB which cause inactivation and that these are at or near the isocitrate site of the enzyme.

TI  - Multiple, polymorphic copies of SRY in both males and females of the vole Microtus cabrerae.  
AB  - In mammals, sex determination is controlled by the Y-linked gene SRY. Although SRY is male-specific in most eutherian and marsupial species, with a single copy on the Y chromosome, several rodent species have multiple Y-linked copies of SRY, and two mole-vole species of the genus Ellobius determine sex without the Y chromosome or the SRY gene. We searched for homologs of SRY in three vole species of the genus Microtus and concluded that this gene is not male-specific in M. cabrerae, as it is present in multiple, polymorphic copies in both males and females. In contrast, SRY is male-specific in the related species M. agrestis and M. nivalis. Up to 15 different partial sequences of the SRY gene were found in M. cabrerae. Southern blots suggest that most of the extra copies of SRY are X-linked. One of the copies observed only in males has a sequence identical to that of the SRY gene in M. agrestis and may represent a functional copy of the gene in this species. The rest are probably nonfunctional pseudogenes.

TI  - Recognition of analogous and homologous protein folds--assessment of prediction success and associated alignment accuracy using empirical substitution matrices.  
AB  - Fold recognition methods aim to use the information in the known protein structures (the targets) to identify that the sequence of a protein of unknown structure (the probe) will adopt a known fold. This paper highlights that the structural similarities sought by these methods can be divided into two types: remote homologues and analogues. Homologues are the result of divergent evolution and often share a common function. We define remote homologues as those that are not easily detectable by sequence comparison methods alone. Analogues do not have a common ancestor and generally do not have a common function. Several sets of empirical matrices for residue substitution, secondary structure conservation and residue accessibility conservation have previously been derived from aligned pairs of remote homologues and analogues (Russell et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1997, 269, 423-439). Here a method for fold recognition, FOLDFIT, is introduced that uses these matrices to match the sequences, secondary structures and residue accessibilities of the probe and target. The approach is evaluated on distinct datasets of analogous and remotely homologous folds. The accuracy of FOLDFIT with the different matrices on the two datasets is contrasted to results from another fold recognition method (THREADER) and to searches using mutation matrices in the absence of any structural information. FOLDFIT identifies at top rank 12 out of 18 remotely homologous folds and five out of nine analogous folds. The average alignment accuracies for residue and secondary structure equivalencing are much higher for homologous folds (residue approximately 42%, secondary structure approximately 78%) than for analogues folds (approximately 12%, approximately 47%). Sequence searches alone can be successful for several homologues in the testing sets but nearly always fail for the analogues. These results suggest that the recognition of analogous and remotely homologous folds should be assessed separately. This study has implications for the development and comparative evaluation of fold recognition algorithms.

TI  - Apatite induction by insoluble dentin collagen.  
AB  - Phosphoproteins are thought to play a role in mineral formation in dentin. A portion of this phosphoprotein is bound to collagen. We have investigated the requirement for bound phosphate in mineral induction by isolated dentin collagen. Insoluble bovine dentin collagen obtained by ethylene-diamino-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) demineralization had 19.5 mol of P/mol of collagen that could not be extracted with 0.5 M EDTA in 4 M guanidine HCl. When this collagen was incubated in supersaturated solutions that did not spontaneously precipitate, apatite was induced. With progressive enzymatic dephosphorylation, induction times for mineral formation became progressively longer. The dentin did not induce mineral formation when 90% of the ester phosphate was removed. Insoluble bone collagen, which had even less phosphate, also did not induce mineral formation. Mineral induction times by dentin collagen increased with decreasing solution saturations. Using these data, the interfacial tension for mineral induction was determined to be 90 ergs/cm2. This value approximated that of phosphatidic acid liposomes and of phosvitin cross-linked to agarose beads, and it might reflect the energetics of heterogeneous nucleation on a highly phosphorylated surface. Sequestering of calcium-phosphate clusters on the phosphoprotein probably accounts for the observed calcium binding by dentin collagen in excess of that required to neutralize the phosphate esters of the collagen. Because the phosphoprotein is immobilized at a low density on the collagen, it cannot self-associate in calcium-phosphate solutions as it does when it is free in solution. This immobilized phosphoprotein allows the mineral clusters formed on its surface to grow into a crystalline order.

TI  - Metabolic activation and formation of DNA adducts of hexestrol, a synthetic nonsteroidal carcinogenic estrogen.  
AB  - Hexestrol (HES), a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen, is carcinogenic in Syrian golden hamsters. The major metabolite of HES is its catechol, 3'-OH-HES, which can be metabolically converted to the electrophilic catechol quinone, HES-3',4'-Q, by peroxidases and cytochrome P450. Standard adducts were synthesized by reacting HES-3',4'-Q with dG and dA to produce the adducts 3'-OH-HES-6'(alpha, beta)-N7Gua and HES-3',4'-Q-6'-N6dA, respectively. When HES-3',4'-Q was reacted with calf thymus DNA, 3'-OH-HES-6'(alpha,beta)-N7Gua was identified by HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry as the depurinating adduct, with minor amounts of stable adducts. 3'-OH-HES was bound to DNA after activation by horseradish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, or rat liver microsomes. The depurinating adduct 3'-OH-HES-6'(alpha, beta)-N7Gua was identified in these systems at levels of 65, 41, and 11 micromol/mol of DNA-P, respectively. Unidentified stable adducts were observed in much lower amounts and were quantified by the 32P-postlabeling method. Similarly to 3'-OH-HES, the catechol metabolites of the natural steroidal estrogens estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), namely, 2-OHE1, 4-OHE1, 2-OHE2, and 4-OHE2, can be oxidized to their corresponding quinones by peroxidases and cytochrome P450. The quinones of the carcinogenic 4-OHE1 and 4-OHE2 have chemical and biochemical properties similar to those of HES-3',4'-Q. The results suggest that formation of HES-3',4'-Q may be a critical event in tumor initiation by HES and that HES is an excellent model compound to corroborate the hypothesis that estrogen-3,4-quinones are ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of the natural steroidal estrogens E1 and E2.

TI  - Chimeric beta-EF3-alpha hemoglobin (Psi): energetics of subunit interaction and ligand binding.  
AB  - Among the numerous strategies to design an oxygen carrier, we outline in this work the engineering of a stable homotetrameric hemoglobin, expressed in Escherichia coli. The chimeric globin (Psi) consists of the first 79 residues of human beta globin (corresponding to positions NA1 --> EF3) followed by the final 67 residues of human alpha globin (corresponding to positions EF3 --> HC3). The molecular mass for beta-EF3-alpha (Psi) globin was measured using mass spectrometry to be equal to its theoretical value: 15782 Da. Correct protein folding was assessed by UV/visible and fluorescence spectra. The subunit interaction free energies were estimated by HPLC gel filtration. In the cyanometHb species, the formation of the dimer-tetramer interface is 2 kcal/mol less favorable (Delta G = -7 kcal/mol) than that of Hb A (Delta G = -9 kcal/mol), whereas the dimer-monomer interface is tightly assembled (< -10 kcal/mol) as for the Hb A alpha 1 beta 1 interface. In contrast to Hb A, oxygen binding to Psi Hb is not cooperative. The free energy for binding four oxygen molecules to a Psi homotetramer is slightly increased compared to a Hb A heterotetramer (-28 and -27.5 kcal/4 mol of O2, respectively). The intrinsic O2 affinity of a Psi homodimer is 6-fold higher than that of a homotetramer. The linkage scheme between dimer-tetramer subunit assembly and the noncooperative oxygenation of Psi Hb predicts a stabilization of the tetramer after ligand release. This protein mechanism resembles that of Hb A for which the dimers exhibit a 100-fold higher O2 affinity relative to deoxy tetramers (which are 10(5) times more stable than oxy tetramers). A potent allosteric effector of Hb A, RSR4, binds to Psi Hb tetramers, inducing a decrease of the overall O2 affinity. Since RSR4 interacts specifically with two binding sites of deoxy Hb A, we propose that the chimeric tetramer folding is close to this native structure.

TI  - Thermodynamics of the interaction of the Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR with DNA studied by fluorescence spectroscopy.  
AB  - Fluorescence quenching was used to study the site-specific binding of the Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR to a fluoresceinated oligonucleotide (9F30A/30B) containing a TyrR binding site. The equilibrium constant for the interaction (KL) was measured as a function of temperature and salt concentration in the presence and absence of ATPgammaS, a specific ligand for TyrR. Fluorescence titrations yielded a KL value of 1.20 x 10(7) M-1 at 20 degrees C, which was independent of the acceptor (9F30A/30B) concentration in the range 5-500 nM, indicating that the system exhibits true equilibrium binding. Clarke and Glew analysis of the temperature dependence of binding revealed a linear dependence of R ln KL on temperature in the absence of ATPgammaS. The thermodynamic parameters obtained at 20 degrees C (theta) were = -35.73 kJ mol-1, = 57.41 kJ mol-1, and = 93.14 kJ mol-1. Saturating levels of ATPgammaS (200 microM) strengthened binding at all temperatures and resulted in a nonlinear dependence of Rln KL on temperature. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing binding under these conditions were = -39.32 kJ mol-1, = 37.16 kJ mol-1, = 76.40 kJ mol-1, and = -1.03 kJ mol-1 K-1. Several conclusions were drawn from these data. First, binding is entropically driven at 20 degrees C in both the presence and absence of ATPgammaS. This can partly be accounted for by counterions released from the DNA upon TyrR binding; in the absence of ATPgammaS and divalent cations, the TyrR-9F30A/30B interaction results in the release of two to three potassium ions. Second, the more favorable value, and hence tighter binding observed in the presence of ATPgammaS, is primarily due to a decrease in (-20.3 kJ mol-1), which overcomes an unfavorable decrease in (-16.7 kJ mol-1). Third, the negative value obtained in the presence of ATPgammaS indicates that the binding of ATPgammaS favors a conformational change in TyrR upon binding to 9F30A/30B, yielding a more stable complex.

TI  - The effect of boundary selection on the stability and folding of the third fibronectin type III domain from human tenascin.  
AB  - Correct selection of domain boundaries is critical for structural analysis of single domains from multimodular proteins. Folding and stability studies of the third fibronectin type III domain from human tenascin (TNfn31-90) have shown that it is moderately stable (Delta G(D-N)(H2O) approximately 5 kcal mol-1) and folds with two-state kinetics. In an attempt to stabilize the protein, five domains were constructed with different combinations of extensions to the N- and C-termini. Thermal denaturation studies show that a specific two amino acid (Gly-Leu) extension at the C-terminus is primarily responsible for a significant increase in stability. The Delta Delta G(D-N)(H2O) of the Gly-Leu extension (TNfn3(1-92)) is 2.7 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1. Refolding kinetics do not differ significantly, but unfolding is slowed 40-fold. Mutation of leucine 92 to alanine does not affect stability, indicating that the stability of the extension does not come from the packing of the leucine side chain. Hydrogen exchange data suggest that the extension adds new hydrogen bonds and strengthens existing hydrogen bonds in the C-terminal interaction with the A-B and E-F loops. Removal of a very small number of hydrogen bonds substantially increases the unfolding rate, a phenomenon which may be important in stress-relaxation of FNIII-containing muscle proteins such as titin. These experiments demonstrate the importance of a small number of additional long-range interactions in the overall formation of a compact independently folding beta-sheet module.

TI  - Position dependence of non-polar amino acid intrinsic helical propensities.  
AB  - Until now and based on the success of the helix/coil transition theory it has been assumed that the alpha-helical propensities of the amino acids are position independent. This has been critical to derive the set of theoretical parameters for the 20 natural amino acids. Here, we have analyzed the behavior of several non-polar residues, Val, Ile, Leu, Met and Gly at the N-cap, at each position of the first helical turn and at a central helical position of a 16-residue peptide model system that starts with eight consecutive alanine residues. We have interpreted the results from these experiments with the model of the helix/coil transition (AGADIR), that indicates that the intrinsic helical propensity is position dependent. Gly, Val and Ile are more favorable at the first turn than in the middle of the alpha-helix, while for Leu and Met we observe the opposite behavior. The differences between the observed helical propensities are as large as 1.0 kcal/mol in some cases. Molecular modeling calculations using the ECEPP/2 force-field equipped with a hydration potential show that this effect can be explained by the combination of three factors: (a) the side-chains in the first helix turn are more solvent-exposed; (b) they have fewer intramolecular van der Waals' contacts; and (c) they posses higher configurational entropy than that in the central position of an alpha-helix. The position-dependent results of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates and with the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids derived from the statistical analysis of the protein structure database.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the injured effects of nicotine on isolated rat common carotid artery and to supply experimental proofs for vascular vessel and organ transplantation. METHODS: Asins relaxing and contractile functional test of isolated vascular vessel and scanning electron microscopy techniques, we observed the influence of nicotine on the contractile and the relaxing function of isolated artery and the intact of the intima. RESULTS: Lower concentrations of nicotine (6 x-10 mol/L-6 x 10(-6) mol/L) produced a concentration-dependent constrictor response of 18%-41% relative to those induced by norepinephrine (NE, 10(-7) mol/L), whereas removal of endothelium reduced nicotine-induced constrictions to 5%-21%. Higher concentrations of nicotine (6 x 10(-5) mol/L-6 x 10(-3) mol/L) not only injured contractile function of vascular smooth muscle but also caused severe damage to the intima. Various concentrations of nicotine all inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation response. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine not only has cytotoxicity to vascular vessel but also results in vasoconstrictor effects which depend upon endothelium intact, probably by inhibiting the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor.

TI  - Conformation of the Ras-binding domain of Raf studied by molecular dynamics and free energy simulations.  
AB  - Recognition of Ras by its downstream target Raf is mediated by a Ras-recognition region in the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf. Residues 78-89 in this region occupy two different conformations in the ensemble of NMR solution structures of the RBD: a fully alpha-helical one, and one where 87-90 form a type IV beta-turn. Molecular dynamics simulations of the RBD in solution were performed to explore the stability of these and other possible conformations of both the wild-type RBD and the R89K mutant, which does not bind Ras. The simulations sample a fully helical conformation for residues 78-89 similar to the NMR helical structures, a conformation where 85-89 form a 3(10)-helical turn, and a conformation where 87-90 form a type I beta-turn, whose free energies are all within 0.3 kcal/mol of each other. NOE patterns and H(alpha) chemical shifts from the simulations are in reasonable agreement with experiment. The NMR turn structure is calculated to be 3 kcal/mol higher than the three above conformations. In a simulation with the same implicit solvent model used in the NMR structure generation, the turn conformation relaxes into the fully helical conformation, illustrating possible structural artifacts introduced by the implicit solvent model. With the Raf R89K mutant, simulations sample a fully helical and a turn conformation, the turn being 0.9 kcal/mol more stable. Thus, the mutation affects the population of RBD conformations, and this is expected to affect Ras binding. For example, if the fully helical conformation of residues 78-89 is required for binding, its free energy increase in R89K will increase the binding free energy by about 0.6 kcal/mol.

Isoform 1 consisted of 2,700 bp, from which a 667 amino acid sequence was deduced and found to be identical with that of OS-9 cDNA from osteosarcoma cells [Su et al. (1996) Mol.

Isoforms 2 and 3 encode 612 and 597 amino acid polypeptides, respectively. Comparison of their cDNA sequences with the genomic structure indicated that three isoforms are splice variants. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed predominant expression of isoform 2 mRNA in myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, osteosarcoma OsA-CL cells and rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells. Northern blotting revealed similar levels of expression of OS-9 gene in various tumor cell lines of sarcoma cells, carcinoma cells and myeloid leukemia cells, but 3-4 times higher expression in OsA-CL cells and Rh30 cells containing a homogeneously staining region of 12q13-15. OS-9 expression decreased in differentiation-induced HL-60 cells. Possible involvement of the OS-9 gene in cell growth is discussed.

The reaction appears to follow a pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the dimer concentration. One mole of oxygen was consumed in the reaction per mole of NAD(P) dimer oxidized and hydrogen peroxide was produced. The monomers NADPH and NADH under the same reaction conditions were not oxidized by DCMV++. In anaerobiosis NAD(P) dimers but not NAD(P)H rapidly reduced DCMV++ to its radical cation DCMV++, which was rapidly back-oxidized by air to its parent dication. Paraquat (MV++) was also able to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of NAD(P) dimers and, at a much lower extent, NADPH and NADH, but only under light irradiation. In anaerobiosis and upon light irradiation all the above nucleotides were able to convert paraquat to its radical cation MV++, reoxidized to MV++ by air admission. This study shows the different ability of NAD(P) dimers and NAD(P)H to undergo one-electron and two-electron oxidation reactions, with different viologens.

This phenomenon is confirmed in systems in which the beta82 lysines of human hemoglobin are covalently cross-linked by acylation with dicarboxylic acids of increasing length, namely the fumaryl (four-carbon-long), adipoyl (six-carbon-long), and sebacoyl (10-carbon-long) residues. Consistently in all of the systems here reported, the enthalpy excursions are masked by compensatory entropy changes, which keep the free energy of ligand binding constant for the first three steps of oxygenation. Furthermore, the cooperativity index and the overall oxygen affinity seem to be correlated to the positive enthalpy excursions of the intermediate steps of ligation. Fumaryl-Hb (hemoglobin cross-linked with a fumaryl residue, four carbons) with the lowest absorption of heat has the highest affinity and lowest cooperativity index. Adipoyl-Hb (hemoglobin cross-linked with an adipoyl residue, six carbons) has the highest absorption of heat and the highest cooperativity index. It appears that nonuniform heat release by the intermediates of oxygenation is part of the allosteric phenomena in hemoglobin systems. There is not enough information that would allow assigning these phenomena to the interplay of the various conformations described for hemoglobin besides the classic T (Fermi et al. 1984. J. Mol. Biol. 175:159-174) and R (Shanaan. 1983. J. Mol. Biol. 171:31-59), as listed at the end of the Discussion. The possibility cannot be excluded that entropy-driven steps characterize new conformational transitions still to be described.

TI  - Induction, duration, and resolution of airway goblet cell hyperplasia in a murine model of atopic asthma: effect of concurrent infection with respiratory syncytial virus and response to dexamethasone.  
AB  - We recently described a murine model of atopic asthma in which a marked, extensive hyperplasia of airway goblet cells is induced by repeated challenge of ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized mice with intratracheally administered allergen (Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996;14:425-438). We report here the time course of the duration of this feature and of its spontaneous resolution in the absence of further allergen exposure. Induction of severe neutrophilic inflammation in the airways by repeated intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide failed to induce goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) to as great a degree as that induced by allergen, suggesting that nonallergic inflammation is a relatively poor inducer of this phenotype change in mice. When a "subclinical" infection of the lungs with the human A2 strain of respiratory syncytial virus was superimposed on the model of atopic asthma, recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes to the airways was enhanced and a discharge of goblet cell mucin contents was observed. This may partly explain the respiratory difficulty that typifies virally induced exacerbations of asthma in humans. Daily systemic treatment of sensitized mice with dexamethasone during the period of allergen challenge produced a dose-related suppression of developing GCH, while similar treatment during the period following the establishment of extensive hyperplasia induced an accelerated resolution toward a normal epithelial phenotype. These results confirm and extend the relevance of this model as a representation of the human disease.

TI  - The effect of levobunolol hydrochloride on the calcium and potassium channels in isolated ventricular myocytes of guinea pig.  
AB  - The effects of levobunolol hydrochlorid (Bun) on the type L calcium channel currents (ICA) and delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (IK) in isolated ventricular myocytes of guinea pig were studied by using patch clamp whole cell recording techniques. The results were showed that: 1) Bun caused a dose dependent decrease in ICA and a dose-dependent increase in IK of the ventricular myocytes. The threshold concentrations of Bun for ICA and IK were 10(-8) mol/L and 10(-7) mol/L respectively. The maximum effective concentration of Bun for bot ICA and IK was 3x10(-5) mol/L, and half-maximal concentration was 3x10(-6) mol/L; 2) IK was blocked by 2x100(-6) mol/L tetraethylammonium (TEA). A concentration of 3x10(-6) mol/L Bun showed a decreasing effect on the ICA as revealed by the current-voltage relationship curve, i.e., Bun caused an elevation of the curve;3) When ICA was blocked by 2x10(-6) mol/L Isoptin (Verapamil), at a concentration of 3x10(-6) mol/L Bun showed an increasing effect on IK and the effect could be blocked by TEA. The above-mentioned results indicated that Bun had an inhibitory effect on ICA and a fascilitatory effect on IK. The results suggested that the molecular mechanisms of antihypertensive, heart rate slowing the beta -receptor blocking effects of Bun might be due to decrease of ICA and increase of IK.

TI  - New modular delivery system for diagnostic and therapeutic pre-targeting using tautomer-specific monoclonal antibody EM-6-47 and 3-substituted adenines.  
AB  - We have developed a new modular affinity system for the 2-step delivery of functional molecules to target cells. The system is based on the tautomer-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) EM-6-47, which binds to 3- and 3,8-substituted adenines with high affinity (Ka > 10(9) l/mol) without cross-reacting with naturally occurring purine derivatives. This MAb serves as the hapten-specific fusion partner to produce bispecific MAbs (bs-MAbs) recognizing a target cell antigen and a low-m.w. hapten as carrier molecule for, e.g., radionuclides. Either the C-8 or the N-3 position of adenines can be used for conjugation with effector molecules; the remaining position may be substituted with different moieties to modulate the pharmacokinetics of the haptens. Different 3- and 3,8-substituted adenines conjugated to the chelates DOTA and DTPA or to the drug daunomycin were synthesized. Adenine-chelate derivatives were efficiently labeled with (111)In and 90Y, while high-affinity binding of 3-substituted adenines to MAb EM-6-47 remained almost unaffected by the conjugation to radiochelates. To confirm the validity of the delivery system, a prototype bs-MAb, EM-168-47, was generated by somatic cell fusion of MAb EM-6-47 and MAb EM-168-2, the latter recognizing a surface antigen on canine hematopoietic cells. Two-step targeting assays in vitro verified the bs-MAb-mediated, dose-dependent delivery of (111)In-labeled adenine-chelate derivatives to myeloid cells. This system represents a powerful tool for new pre-targeting approaches relying on bs-MAbs and low-m.w. haptens. Suitable cellular antigens can be targeted by fusing the appropriate MAbs with hapten-specific MAb EM-6-47, and tailor-made 3-substituted adenines may be labeled with diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclides, cytotoxic drugs or other functional molecules.

TI  - Substrate specificity of NO synthases: detailed comparison of L-arginine, homo-L-arginine, their N omega-hydroxy derivatives, and N omega-hydroxynor-L-arginine.  
AB  - A detailed comparison of the oxidation of five compounds closely related to L-arginine (Arg) by purified recombinant neuronal and macrophage NO synthases (NOS I and NOS II) was performed. Homo-L-arginine (homo-Arg) is oxidized by both NOSs in the presence of NADPH with major formation of NO and homo-L-citrulline, with a molar ratio of close to 1, and minor formation of N omega-hydroxyhomo-L-arginine (homo-NOHA). Oxidation of homo-NOHA by the two NOSs also leads to NO and homocitrulline in a 1:1 molar ratio. On the contrary, N omega-hydroxynor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) is a very poor substrate of NOS I and II, which fails to produce significant amounts of nitrite. The catalytic efficiency of both NOSs markedly decreases in the order Arg > NOHA > homo-Arg > homo-NOHA, as shown by the 20- and 10-fold decrease of kcat/Km observed for NOS I and NOS II, respectively, when comparing Arg to homo-NOHA. The greater loss of catalytic efficiency for homo-Arg, when compared to that for Arg, appears to occur at the first step (N-hydroxylation) of the reaction. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the Vm values for NOHA and homo-NOHA oxidation are very similar (about 1 and 2 micromol of NO min-1 mg of protein-1 for NOS I and II, respectively). In fact, lengthening of the Arg chain by one CH2 leads not only to markedly decreased kcat/Km but also to clear disturbances in NOS functioning. This is shown by a greater accumulation of the N omega-hydroxyguanidine intermediate (homo-NOHA:homocitrulline ratio between 0.2 and 0.4) and an increased consumption of NADPH for NO formation (between 2.0 and 2.6 mol of NADPH consumed for the formation of 1 mol of NO in the case of homo-Arg, instead of 1.5 mol in the case of Arg). Most of the above results could be interpreted by comparing the possible positionings of the various substrates relative to the two NOS active oxygen species which are believed to be responsible for the two steps of the reaction.

TI  - [The intratumoral levels of thymidylate synthetase and folate in gastric and colon cancer]  
AB  - Currently, biochemical modulation for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most successful chemotherapy for both colo-rectal and gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of measuring intratumoral thymidylate synthetase (TS) and folate (FH4) levels as predictive parameters for the successful treatment. Samples were collected from 16 advanced colo-rectal and 21 advanced gastric cancer. TS and tetrahydrofolate levels in the specimens were measured by binding assay. Results showed that there were no significant difference in TS levels between the different pathologic types of carcinoma. On the other hand, well (3.94 +/- 1.75 p mol/g) and moderately (5.95 +/- 2.69 p mol/g) differentiated carcinoma showed lower FH4 levels compared to poorly differentiated carcinoma (9.58 +/- 5.27 p mol/g). In conclusion, biochemical modulation by cisplatin or leucovorin, which elevates intratumoral folate levels, is more needed for well and moderately differentiated carcinoma. Finally, measuring TS levels can also be important because two cases who responded to cisplatin/5-FU chemotherapy showed low TS levels compared to the others who had lower response.

TI  - Carboxy-group modification: high-temperature activation of charge-neutralized and charge-reversed beta-glucosidases from Aspergillus niger.  
AB  - Purified beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger NIAB280 was chemically modified by l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodi-imide (EDC) in the presence of glycinamide (GAM) as nucleophile under various conditions to study the role of carboxy groups in the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. beta-Glucosidase was inactivated by the binding of one mol of EDC per mol of the enzyme with a second-order rate constant of 4.77 x 10(-2) mM min-1. Glucose, as competitive inhibitor, partly protected the active-site carboxy group against chemical modification, with a Kd of 3.64 mM. The pH dependence of chemical modification by EDC showed that first-order rate constants decreased with increasing pH, indicating that the proton donating group is a carboxy group. The pKa values of the acidic and basic limbs of the native enzyme were 2.9 and 6.5 respectively. beta-Glucosidase was modified by EDC in the presence of GAM and ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (EDAM) as nucleophiles for 60 min. The effects of neutralization (GAM) and reversal (EDAM) of the negative charges of surface carboxy groups on the kinetic properties of the enzyme were also studied. Native beta-glucosidase, GAM and EDAM had Vmax/K(m) values of 0.73, 1.22 and 0.60 respectively at 40 degrees C. Interestingly, the activation energy profiles of native beta-glucosidase (103 and 79 kJ/mol) were biphasic, whereas those of GAM (137, 101 and 30 kJ/mol) and EDAM (285, 100 and 29 kJ/mol) were triphasic, indicating significant activation of modified beta-glucosidases at temperatures higher than 50 degrees C. The pKa values of both the active-site carboxy groups as well as the pH optima of GAM and EDAM were also significantly decreased compared with those of the native beta-glucosidase.

TI  - Structural investigations of basic amphipathic model peptides in the presence of lipid vesicles studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence, monolayer and modeling.  
AB  - A cationic amphiphilic peptide made of 10 leucine and 10 lysine residues, and four of its fluorescent derivatives in which leucines were substituted by Trp residues at different locations on the primary sequence have been synthesized. The interactions of these five peptides with neutral anionic or cationic vesicles were investigated using circular dichroism, steady state and time-resolved fluorescence with a combination of Trp quenching by brominated lipid probes, monolayers, modeling with minimization and simulated annealing procedures. We show that all the five peptides interact with neutral and anionic DMPC, DMPG, DOPC or egg yolk PC vesicles. The binding takes place whatever the peptide conformation in solution is. In the case of DMPC bilayers the binding free energy DeltaG is estimated at -8 kcal mole-1 and the number of phospholipid molecules involved is about 20-25 per peptide molecule. Peptides are bound as single-stranded alpha helices orientated parallel to the bilayer surface. In the anchoring of phospholipid head groups around the peptides, the lipid molecules are not smeared out in a plane parallel to the membrane surface but are organized around the hydrophilic face of the alpha helices like 'wheat grains around an ear' and protrude outside the bilayer towards the solvent. We suggest that such a lipid arrangement generates transient structural defects responsible for the membrane permeability enhancement. When an electrical potential is applied, the axis of the peptide helices remains parallel to the membrane surface and does not reorient to give rise to a bundle of helix monomers that forms transmembrane channels via a 'barrel stave' mechanism. The penetration depth of alpha helices in relation to the position of phosphorus atoms in the unperturbed lipid leaflet is estimated at 3.2 A. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Material property characteristics for lipid bilayers containing lysolipid.  
AB  - The apparent area expansion modulus and tensile strength of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) membranes are measured in the presence of monooleoylphosphatidylcholine (MOPC). The apparent area expansion modulus decreases from 171 mN m-1 for pure EPC membrane to 82 mN m-1 for a membrane containing 30 mol % MOPC. This significant decrease of the apparent area expansion modulus is attributed to the change of the membrane area due to the tension-dependent exchange of MOPC between the bathing solution and the membrane. Similar to the apparent area expansion modulus, the tensile strength of the membrane decreases with the increase of the molar concentration of MOPC in the membrane. The tensile strength of pure EPC membrane is 9.4 mN m-1 whereas that for a membrane containing 30 mol % MOPC is only 1.8 mN m-1, and for a membrane containing 50 mol % MOPC it is even smaller, on the order of 0.07 mN m-1. The decrease of the tensile strength is coupled with a decrease of the work for membrane breakdown, which changes from 4.3 x 10(-2) kT for pure EPC membrane to 2 x 10(-6) kT for a membrane with 50 mol % MOPC. Overall, these results show that the decrease of the apparent area expansion modulus in the presence of exchangeable molecules is a fundamental property for all membranes and depends on the area occupied by these molecules. The method presented here provides a unique tool for measuring the area occupied by an exchangeable molecule in the bilayer membrane.

TI  - Characterization of a partially unfolded structure of cytochrome c induced by sodium dodecyl sulphate and the kinetics of its refolding.  
AB  - The mechanism of unfolding of ferricytochrome c induced by the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate has been studied by heme absorption, tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, resonance Raman scattering, stopped-flow and time-resolved resonance energy transfer to obtain a comprehensive view of the whole process. Unfolding occurred at an almost specific molecular ratio of SDS/cytochrome c in the concentration range (20-50 microM) studied here. However there appears to be a point at approximately 0.6 mM SDS where unfolding begins to occur for lower cytochrome c concentrations. The kinetics of unfolding revealed only a single transition with a rate constant of 33 s(-1) (at 298 K, [SDS] = 8.7 mM) and activation energy barrier of approximately 16 kJ/mol, indicating that other associated steps, if any, are too fast to be significantly populated. The free energy change (deltaG(o)) involved with the unfolding transition was estimated to be about 16.8 kJ/mol. The CD spectrum at 220 nm of SDS-unfolded cytochrome c shows only a partial decrease (25%), indicating that a significant amount of helical structure remains folded in contrast to a complete loss of helical structure in GdnHCl-denatured cytochrome c. The heme structure in SDS-unfolded cytochrome c, as deduced from heme absorption and resonance Raman spectra, shows a major population (approximately 95%) of mis-ligated histidine to the heme which acts as a kinetic trap in the folding process. The structural changes associated with cytochrome c unfolding were also monitored by time-resolved resonance energy transfer which shows a drastic increase in tryptophan fluorescence lifetime from 12 ps in the native protein to 0.63 ns in the unfolded one, associated with a movement of Trp59 by 10 A away from heme. The maximum entropy method analysis of fluorescence decay indicated the growth of various conformational substates in SDS-unfolded cytochrome c in contrast to narrowly distributed conformations in the native protein. The refolding was comprised of three kinetic steps; the first was significantly fast (approximately 8 ms) and was assigned to the dissociation of His26 that paves the protein towards correct folding pathway. The other two slower steps probably arise from chain misorganization and prolyl isomerization. The absence of a burst-phase amplitude supports the idea that the burst phase observed in the folding from completely unfolded cytochrome c corresponds to a molecular collapse that produces significant secondary structure. The partially unfolded state represents a unique intermediate state in the folding pathway.

TI  - A general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability of a protein: stability and structure of a series of hydrophobic mutants of human lysozyme.  
AB  - To get a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability, five Ile to Val and nine Val to Ala mutants (3SS mutants) from 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme were constructed. As known from previous studies, the 3SS protein lacking a disulfide bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic factors, as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kJ/mol in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaG) value, as compared to the wild-type protein, which has four disulfide bonds. In this study, the stabilities and structures of the 3SS mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis, respectively, and compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the wild-type (4SS) protein published previously.The stabilities of all the 3SS mutants, except for V110A-3SS were decreased as compared with that of the 3SS protein, coinciding with the results for the 4SS mutants. The change in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (DeltaDeltaG) values of the 3SS mutants relative to the 3SS protein at the denaturation temperature (49.2 degreesC) of the 3SS protein at pH 2.7 were similar to those of the equivalent 4SS mutants relative to the wild-type at 64.9 degreesC.The Delta DeltaG values of the 3SS mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (Delta DeltaASAHP) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were considered. This correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4SS mutants. The linear relation between Delta DeltaG and Delta DeltaASAHP for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of T4 lysozyme already reported, indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations.

TI  - Production of paired helical filament, tau-like proteins by PC12 cells: a model of neurofibrillary degeneration.  
AB  - Neuron-like cells derived from a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) and differentiated with nerve growth factor produce a paired helical filament (PHF)-like antigen when they are subjected to heat shock (Wallace et al.: Mol Brain Res 19:149-155, 1993). It accumulates in a localized region of the perinuclear cytoplasm and reacts with monoclonal antitau antibodies, which identify epitopes in the N- and C-terminal halves and the microtubule-binding domain of tau protein. The observed profile of immunoreactivity suggests the presence of full-length and C-terminally truncated tau in a region of perinuclear cytoplasm in which no structurally intact PHFs could be demonstrated by conventional transmission electron microscopy. The accumulated tau protein colocalized with antibodies raised against mitochondrial outer membrane proteins and was associated with the presence of numerous mitochondrial profiles that were demonstrated with electron microscopy. Because differentiated PC12 cells pretreated with colcemid or Taxol prior to heat shock fail to exhibit perinuclear PHF-like immunoreactivity, the reported response to heat shock appears to require an intact system of intracellular microtubules. This PC12 system provides a model in which the metabolic and molecular biological underpinnings of neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease can be manipulated. The system may eventually be applicable to the development of pharmaceutical agents that interfere with formation and/or degeneration of PHF-tau in Alzheimer's disease.

All possess unique 16S rDNA sequences indicating they are new, previously unreported organisms. Phylogenetic analyses coupled with phenotypic characterization indicated that one of the strains is most closely related to the low mol% G + C genus Planococcus for which a new species, P. mcmeekinii, is proposed. The two other strains are members of the high mol% G + C Gram-positive bacteria and most closely related to the genera Arthrobacter and Brachybacterium.

TI  - Characterization of three fibrinogenolytic enzymes from Chinese green tree viper (Trimeresurus stejnegeri) venom.  
AB  - From the venom of Chinese green tree viper (Trimeresurus stejnegeri), three distinct fibrinogenolytic enzymes: stejnefibrase-1, stejnefibrase-2 and stejnefibrase-3, were purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance chromatography (HPLC). SDS-PAGE analysis of those three enzymes showed that they consisted of a single polypeptide chain with mol. wt of 50000, 31000 and 32000, respectively. Like TSV-PA (a specific plasminogen activator) and stejnobin (a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme) purified from the same venom, stejnefibrase-1, -2 and -3 were able to hydrolyze several chromogenic substrate. On the other hand, different from TSV-PA and stejnobin, stejnefibrase-1, -2 and -3 did not activate plasminogen and did not possess fibrinogen-clotting activity. The three purified enzymes directly degraded fibrinogen to small fragments and rendered it unclottable by thrombin. Stejnefibrase-2 degraded preferentially Bbeta-chain while stejnefibrase-1 and -3 cleaved concomitantly Aalpha and Bbeta-chains of fibrinogen. None of these proteases degraded the gamma-chain of fibrinogen. When correlated with the loss of clottability of fibrinogen, the most active enzyme was stejnefibrase-1. The activities of the three enzymes were inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB), indicating that like TSV-PA and stejnobin, they are venom serine proteases.

TI  - Nitric oxide downregulates lung macrophage inflammatory cytokine production.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokine production contributes to lung injury after lung ischemia reperfusion and during lung transplant rejection. Although nitric oxide has been demonstrated to reduce lung injury associated with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, it remains unknown whether the mechanism of nitric oxide's beneficial effects involves reducing lung macrophage inflammatory cytokine production. The purpose of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide downregulates lung macrophage inflammatory cytokine production. METHODS: Lung macrophages were harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage (10(6) macrophage per milliliter from normal Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 animals per group) and treated under ex vivo tissue culture conditions with the nitric oxide releasing compound S-nitoso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (0, 10(-5) 10(-4), 10(-3), 10(-2) mol/L) before induction of inflammatory cytokines with endotoxin, (50 ng/mL for 24 hours). Supernatants were assayed for inflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Continuous nitric oxide release by S-nitoso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine decreased lung macrophage tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta production in a dose-dependent fashion (6 rats per group; data were analyzed for significance [p < 0.05] using two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc correction). CONCLUSIONS: Nitric oxide decreases inflammatory cytokine production by lung macrophage. The mechanism of nitric oxide's beneficial effects may be partially attributable to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines. Nitric oxide may serve an expanded role for reducing inflammatory cytokine production during acute lung injury, ischemia-reperfusion-induced inflammation, or lung transplant rejection.

TI  - Human coronary arteriolar dilation to arachidonic acid depends on cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase and Ca2+-activated K+ channels.  
AB  - Endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a crucial role in regulating vascular tone, especially in resistance vessels. It has been proposed that metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), formed by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase (P450), are endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs). These metabolites have been reported to mediate dilation to endogenous vasoactive compounds, such as bradykinin and acetylcholine. However, it is not known whether these metabolites of AA contribute to dilation of human resistance vessels. This is important since it has been proposed that EDHF serves as a compensatory mechanism to maintain dilation in disease states. Therefore, we studied the effect of AA on vessel diameter and VSMC membrane potential in isolated human coronary microvessels. Arterioles (81+/-5 microm, n=70) were dissected from right atrial appendages at the time of cardiac surgery and cannulated at a distending pressure of 60 mm Hg and zero flow. Changes in internal diameter were recorded with videomicroscopy. Some vessels were impaled with glass microelectrodes to measure membrane potential of VSMCs while internal diameters were simultaneously recorded. After constriction (47+/-2%) with endothelin-1, AA (10(-10)to 10(-5)mol/L) induced substantial dilation of human coronary microvessels, which was abolished by removal of the endothelium. Treatment with 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA, 10(-5) mol/L; a P450 inhibitor) attenuated maximal dilation to AA (49+/-9% versus 91+/-4% [control]; P<0.05 versus control), whereas indomethacin (INDO, 10(-5) mol/L; a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-4) mol/L; a NO synthase inhibitor) were without effect. Both 17-ODYA and miconazole (10(-5) mol/L, a chemically distinct P450 inhibitor) further reduced the dilation to AA in the presence of INDO. The presence of 40 mmol/L KCl or charybdotoxin (10(-8) mol/L, a blocker of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels) impaired dilation to AA (19+/-9% [KCI] versus 76+/-5% [control] and 47+/-6% [charybdotoxin] versus 91+/-3% [control]; P<0.05 for both). After depolarization with endothelin-1 (-26+/-1 mV from -48+/-3 mV [before endothelin]), AA (10(-5)mol/L) in the presence of INDO and L-NAME induced hyperpolarization of VSMCs (-57+/-5 mV). In the presence of 17-ODYA together with INDO and L-NAME, endothelin produced similar depolarization (-26+/-2 mV from - 48+/- 3 mV), but hyperpolarization to AA was reduced (-33+/-2 mV; P<0.05 versus absence of 17-ODYA). AA metabolites formed primarily by P450 produce potent endothelium-dependent dilation of human coronary arterioles via opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels and hyperpolarization of VSMCs. These findings support an important role for P450 metabolites in the regulation of human coronary arteriolar tone.

TI  - The insulin-like growth factor type I receptor stimulates growth and suppresses apoptosis in prostatic stromal cells.  
AB  - Stromal cells derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia synthesize and secrete measurable levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF). Seventy-two-hour conditioned medium obtained from these cells contains IGF-II at levels ranging from 125-177 ng/mL.10(6) cells. IGF-I is almost undetectable. RT-PCR analysis has demonstrated that the genes for both the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) and the type II IGF receptor (IGF-IIR) are expressed by benign stromal cells in vitro. Competition binding analysis for IGF-I and IGF-II confirmed the existence of binding sites for both ligands with respective Kd and binding capacities of 4.9 x 10(-9) mol/L and 6.6 x 10(5) sites/cell and 4.7 x 10(-9) mol/L and 3.8 x 10(6) sites/cell. Under serum-free conditions, IGF-I and IGF-II at 500 ng/mL induce 80% and 113% increases in stromal cell density, respectively, over a 96-h period. Incubation with the IGF-IR-neutralizing antibody alpha IR3 (50 micrograms/mL) reduces the rate of stromal cell proliferation by approximately 60-80% even in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of IGFs. Camptothecin-induced apoptosis is inhibited by the addition of IGF-I and -II (500 ng/mL). alpha IR3 suppresses these survival signals and itself induces cell death in the prostatic stroma. The data suggest that IGF-IR is a pivotal molecule in prostatic stromal cell maintenance, and that specific antagonism may offer a novel means of controlling the fibromuscular expansion characteristic of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

TI  - Physical characterization of nedocromil sodium hydrates.  
AB  - Nedocromil sodium, which is used in the treatment of reversible obstructive airway diseases, such as asthma, is found to exist in the following hydrate phases: the heptahemihydrate, the trihydrate, a monohydrate, and an amorphous phase which contains variable amounts of water (1.5-3.0 mol). An anhydrate phase is formed from the trihydrate at zero humidity at >/= 150 degrees C, but is rapidly hydrated under ambient conditions. The physical and thermodynamic properties of the four hydrate phases were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at ambient and elevated temperatures, hot-stage microscopy (HSM), solid phase interconversion at various relative humidities (RH), intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR), equilibrium solubility measurements, and critical RH measurements. Below 100 degrees C in open pan TGA, the heptahemihydrate and the amorphous forms lose virtually all their water, the monohydrate loses negligible amounts of water, whereas the trihydrate loses the first two moles of water. From 130 degrees C to 200 degrees C in open pan TGA the trihydrate and the monohydrate lose their last mole of water to form the anhydrate. In crimped pan DSC, the thermal events observed are analogous to those observed in open pan TGA, but the temperatures are increased by about 75 degreesC for all except the heptahemihydrate, for which the thermal events are more complex. When the heptahemihydrate is heated in a crimped pan, a melting endotherm is observed at about 75 degrees C followed by three dehydration endotherms. For the crystalline hydrate phases at 22 degrees C, the ranges of stability are as follows: the monohydrate from 0 to 6.4% RH; the trihydrate from 6.4 to 79.5% RH; the heptahemihydrate above 80% RH. A microbalance study showed that the heptahemihydrate is kinetically stable over the range 11 to 79.5% RH. The IDR in water at 25 degrees C under constant hydrodynamic conditions decreases in the rank order: monohydrate > trihydrate > heptahemihydrate, corresponding to the rank order of free energy with respect to the aqueous solution. The equilibrium aqueous solubility of the heptahemihydrate at 25.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C is 0.956 +/- 0.010 M.

TI  - Purification and characterization of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase from filamentous fungus Rhizopus nigricans.  
AB  - We report here the isolation and partial characterization of a flavoprotein, NADPH-cytochrome P450 (cytochrome c) reductase. The enzyme is a part of steroid 11 alpha-hydroxylating system and is associated with the microsomal fraction of the fungus Rhizopus nigricans. Fungal reductase was solubilized from microsomal membranes with Triton X-100 and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity and high-performance ion-exchange chromatography. A 350-fold purification of the enzyme with specific activity of 37 mumol cytochrome c reduced/min/mg protein was achieved. A single protein band was obtained on SDS-PAGE analysis with an apparent molecular weight of 79 kDa. Purified reductase contained approximately equimolar quantities of flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide per mole of the enzyme. Upon induction of the steroid hydroxylating system with progesterone the activity of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c (P450) reductase increased 10-fold. This is in good correlation with the increase in content of fungal cytochrome P450. Purified fungal flavoprotein was active in a reconstituted system with cytochrome P450 C21 from adrenal gland but could not replace adrenodoxin reductase in the mitochondrial steroid 11 beta-hydroxylating system. We were able to confirm the role of the enzyme by reconstituting steroid 11 alpha-hydroxylating activity from the separated components NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome P450, partly purified from fungal microsomes.

TI  - Insulin-mediated growth in aortic smooth muscle and the vascular renin-angiotensin system.  
AB  - Insulin has been shown to directly affect blood vessel tone and to promote vascular hypertrophy, but the mechanism of these actions remains uncertain. Because angiotensin I (Ang I)-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin action and to impede the progression of vascular hypertrophy in hypertensive animal models, it is possible that the vascular properties of insulin may be mediated through the tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS). To evaluate this relationship, we first investigated the effect of insulin on components of the RAS using cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Insulin treatment (1000 microU/mL) markedly increased angiotensinogen mRNA expression and angiotensinogen production. We next investigated the role of the RAS in insulin-mediated cell proliferation, using [3H]thymidine uptake. Studies were done both with insulin alone and in the presence of captopril (1x10(-7) to 10(-5) mol/L) and losartan (1x10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L). [3H]Thymidine uptake was increased significantly by 1000 microU/mL insulin, and this stimulation was reduced by 1x10(-6) mol/L captopril (-38.8%, P<0.05) and by 1x10(-8) mol/L losartan (-37. 5%, P<0.05). Further studies showed that the degree of insulin-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake in VSMCs could be duplicated by 4x10(-10) mol/L Ang II. Losartan reduced the effects of both Ang II and insulin on [3H]thymidine uptake by about 40% to 45% of baseline (P<0.05). Captopril reduced insulin-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake but did not affect Ang II-mediated [3H]thymidine uptake. In summary, insulin induced significant stimulation of angiotensinogen expression and production and stimulated growth similar to that seen with Ang II in cultured rat VSMCs. Inhibition of Ang II production or its binding to the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibited insulin-mediated growth in a fashion similar to that seen with inhibition of Ang II-mediated growth. Thus, insulin can modulate the vascular RAS, and the effect of insulin on vascular growth may be via direct effects on angiotensinogen expression and translation operative through both the AT1 receptor and the conversion of Ang I to Ang II.

TI  - Urinary NAG and GAG as biomarkers of renal effects in exposure to 2-alkoxyalcohols and their acetates.  
AB  - Many sensitive biomarkers are available for the surveillance of the early health effects of chemicals on humans. This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) as biomarkers of early kidney effects in exposure to 2-alkoxyethanols and their acetates. GAG were compared with effects on the urinary beta-N-acetylglycosaminidase activity (NAG). According to the results of the present study, the excretion rate of GAG was higher among women than men. On the other hand, the excretion rate of GAG was lower among exposed subjects than among the controls, and the level was decreased at the tested levels of exposure. The NAG activity was higher in most of the exposed groups than in the controls. The data indicated that an appropriate urinary limit value for ethoxyacetic acid was 30 mmol/mol creatinine in postshift samples and that this value corresponded to an 8-hour exposure level of 2 cm3/m3 2-ethoxyethylacetate. Urinary butoxyacetic acid excretion of 60 mmol/mol creatinine corresponded to the inhalation exposure level of 5 cm3/m3 2-butoxyethanol and its acetate in postshift samples.

TI  - Three rhamnosyltransferases responsible for assembly of the A-band D-rhamnan polysaccharide in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a fourth transferase, WbpL, is required for the initiation of both A-band and B-band lipopolysaccharide synthesis [published erratum appears in Mol Microbiol 1998 Dec;30(5):1131]  
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa A-band lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule has an O-polysaccharide region composed of trisaccharide repeat units of alpha1-->2, alpha1-->3, alpha1-->3 linked D-rhamnose (Rha). The A-band polysaccharide is assembled by the alpha-D-rhamnosyltransferases, WbpX, WbpY and WbpZ. WbpZ probably transfers the first Rha residue onto the A-band accepting molecule, while WbpY and WbpX subsequently transfer two alpha1-->3 linked Rha residues and one alpha1-->2 linked Rha respectively. The last two transferases are predicted to be processive, alternating in their activities to complete the A-band polymer. The genes coding for these transferases were identified at the 3' end of the A-band biosynthetic cluster. Two additional genes, psecoA and uvrD, border the 3' end of the cluster and are predicted to encode a coenzyme A transferase and a DNA helicase II enzyme respectively. Chromosomal wbpX, wbpY and wbpZ mutants were generated, and Western immunoblot analysis demonstrates that these mutants are unable to synthesize A-band LPS, while B-band synthesis is unaffected. WbpL, a transferase encoded within the B-band biosynthetic cluster, was previously proposed to initiate B-band biosynthesis through the addition of Fuc2NAc (2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-D-galactose) to undecaprenol phosphate (Und-P). In this study, chromosomal wbpL mutants were generated that did not express A band or B band, indicating that WbpL initiates the synthesis of both LPS molecules. Cross-complementation experiments using WbpL and its homologue, Escherichia coli WecA, demonstrates that WbpL is bifunctional, initiating B-band synthesis with a Fuc2NAc residue and A-band synthesis with either a GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) or GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine) residue. These data indicate that A-band polysaccharide assembly requires four glycosyltransferases, one of which is necessary for initiating both A-band and B-band LPS synthesis.

TI  - Comparison of ethylene, propylene and styrene 7,8-oxide in vitro adduct formation on N-terminal valine in human haemoglobin and on N-7-guanine in human DNA.  
AB  - Epoxides react at various nucleophilic sites in macromolecules such as haemoglobin and DNA. To study the reaction rate constants of ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO) and styrene 7,8-oxide (SO) towards two of these positions, i.e., the N-terminal valine in haemoglobin and N-7-guanine in DNA was the central aim of this investigation. These two reactive sites are the most studied haemoglobin and DNA adducts, respectively. Further attention, therefore, was also paid to the applicability in vivo of the in vitro determined reaction constants. The determination of the second-order rate constants between EO and PO and N-terminal valine in Hb [2.7 l (mol Hb h)-1 and 1.0 l (mol Hb h)-1, respectively] were consistent with the literature values. The constants for the reaction with N-7-guanine [16x10(-3) l (mol DNA nucleotide h)-1 and 7. 7x10(-3) l (mol DNA nucleotide h)-1, respectively] were lower than previously published values, probably due to differences in the methodology used. The use of the in vitro obtained values to model the in vivo situation lead to a consistent picture for EO and PO. In contrast, for SO the in vitro ratio between the adduct formation on N-terminal valine [1.5 l (mol Hb h)-1] and N-7-guanine [0.71x10(-3) l (mol DNA nucleotide h)-1] was about two orders of magnitude greater than for the in vivo situation. This was probably due to a lower than expected reactivity of SO towards N-terminal valine in vivo. Further research is needed to elucidate whether the use of SO in vitro, contrasting with the in vivo experiments in which SO was metabolically formed from styrene, could entail an explanation for this discrepancy. Concerning the methodological part, the use of dipeptide standards to replace the alkylated globins as standard lead to an improvement of the method. Especially the commercial availability of the standards, their stability and accurately known adduct content will make them to the standards of choice in the future.

TI  - Cocaine and cocaethylene binding to human milk.  
AB  - The binding of cocaine and its ethyl analog, cocaethylene, to human milk was studied using equilibrium dialysis at 4 degrees C. For cocaine, a low-affinity, high-capacity binder was noted (equilibrium constant of association, Ka, 3.12 x 10(3) L/mol; concentration of binding sites, B0, 3.85 x 10(-4) mol/L), as well as a very low affinity, high-capacity binder (Ka, 7.54 x 10(2) L/mol; B0, 1.42 x 10(-3) mol/L). For cocaethylene, 2 low-affinity, high-capacity binders were suggested: a stronger (Ka, 3.79 x 10(3) L/mol; B0, 3.27 x 10(-4) mol/L) and a weaker (Ka, 1.84 x 10(3) L/mol; B0, 8.91 x 10(-4) mol/L) binder The low-affinity, high-capacity binder for cocaine and cocaethylene seems to be albumin, while the weaker nonspecific binding may be due to lipids. Up to 55% of cocaine and up to 61% of cocaethylene were bound to milk; such binding, coupled with the lower pH of milk (6.9) relative to that of serum (7.4), may enhance the mammary secretion of these 2 basic drugs, having important consequences for the nursing infant.

TI  - Assembling and evaluation of new dehydrogenase enzyme electrode probes obtained by electropolymerization of aminobenzine isomers and PQQ on gold, platinum and carbon electrodes.  
AB  - Pt, Au and graphite electrodes have been coated by electropolymerization of 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-diaminobenzene (DAB) and 4-aminobiphenyl in the presence of PQQ using cyclic voltammetry. The activity of the modified electrodes for the oxidation of paracetamol, ascorbic and uric acid was reduced by approximately 90% as compared to the bare electrodes. Polymerization in the presence 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo(2,3-f)quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxilic+ ++ acid, pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ) led, after optimization, to electrodes capable of catalysing the electrooxidation of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH), in the range 10(-4)-10(-2) mol/l with a detection limit of 5 x 10(-5) mol/l. Amperometric measurements of NADH have been carried out at +0.2 V and the efficiency of different electrodes based on different materials has been studied. By co-entrapment of dehydrogenase highly selective enzymes, electrodes for glucose, L-lactate and L-glutamate were obtained. Dehydrogenase substrates such as glucose, lactate and glutamate were measured in the range 5 x 10(-5)-1 x 10(-2) mol/l, with detection limits of 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-6) mol/l, respectively. Probe stability under non-dynamic conditions was evaluated over 2 months. All the probes showed a decrease of 10% over 1 month and a residual activity of 50% over 2 months.

TI  - In vitro transcription of the Leptomonas seymouri SL RNA and U2 snRNA genes using homologous cell extracts.  
AB  - A cell-free transcription system for the spliced leader (SL) RNA gene of the trypanosomatid Leptomonas seymouri has been developed. Accurately initiated transcription was achieved using cell extracts and a template in which the transcribed region of the SL RNA was replaced with a guanosine-less sequence (G-less cassette). The extract was also able to direct accurate initiation of RNA from an L. seymouri tagged U2 snRNA gene, which may be expressed via a transcriptional apparatus shared by the SL RNA gene. In vivo transcription analysis was used previously to define essential sequence components of the SL RNA gene promoter (Hartree D, Bellofatto V. Mol Biochem Parasitol 1995:71:27-39). A substitution mutation in the upstream promoter element (bp - 50 to - 70) markedly reduced transcription in vitro as did deletion of this and the middle promoter element (bp - 30 to - 40). Thus, the in vitro transcription system correctly responds to promoter mutations and is useful for investigating SL RNA and snRNA gene expression.

Contractions evoked by either endothelin-1 or methacholine were reversed by atrial natriuretic peptide (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/l), salbutamol (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l), sodium nitroprusside (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) and isosorbide dinitrate (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l).

TI  - Interactions between endothelin-I-induced contractions and bronchodilators in human isolated bronchi.  
AB  - 1. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of four different bronchodilators (atrial natriuretic peptide, salbutamol, sodium nitroprusside and isosorbide dinitrate) to reverse and also to protect against contractions evoked by the spasmogens endothelin-1 and methacholine in human isolated bronchial rings. 2. Contractions evoked by either endothelin-1 or methacholine were reversed by atrial natriuretic peptide (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/l), salbutamol (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l), sodium nitroprusside (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) and isosorbide dinitrate (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/l). 3. Sodium nitroprusside produced a significantly (P < 0.05 for data points) greater mean maximal inhibition of endothelin-1-induced tone than methacholine-induced tone; however, the other dilators were equally effective at reversing either endothelin-1- or methacholine-induced contractions. Comparing sodium nitroprusside and salbutamol, sodium nitroprusside was significantly (P < 0.05 for data set) less effective than salbutamol at reversing either endothelin-1- or methacholine-induced contractions. 4. To compare the ability of these bronchodilator substances to protect against spasmogen challenge, cumulative concentration-response curves to either endothelin-1 (10(-10)-3 x 10(-7) mol/l) or methacholine (10(-9)-3 x 10(-4) mol/l) were constructed in the presence and absence of each bronchodilator. Atrial natriuretic peptide, at a concentration of 10(-6) mol/l, significantly attenuated contractions evoked by methacholine. In contrast, contractions evoked by endothelin-1 were enhanced by atrial natriuretic peptide at concentrations of 3 x 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l. Preincubation of salbutamol at a concentration of 10(-6) mol/l significantly attenuated methacholine-induced contractions, but responses to endothelin-1 were not altered by preincubation of salbutamol at concentrations of 3 x 10(-7), 10(-6) and 3 x 10(-6) mol/l. Sodium nitroprusside (10(-6) mol/l) and isosorbide dinitrate (3 x 10(-5) mol/l) did not alter responses evoked by subsequent addition of either endothelin-1 or methacholine. At a concentration of 10(-4) mol/l, however, isosorbide dinitrate significantly attenuated endothelin-1-evoked contractions. 5. These results show that drugs which reverse agonist-induced tone in isolated bronchial rings may not necessarily protect against subsequent challenge with this agonist. This suggests that the pharmacology of relaxation may be dissimilar to that of protection.

The following pharmacologic approaches were tested in the remaining five groups: short-acting beta-blockade (esmolol, 6 x 10(-3) mol/L and 3 x 10(-4) mol/L), opening of adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels (nicorandil, 10(-3) mol/L and 10(-5) mol/L), and inhibition of the pacemaker current, which largely accounts for the diastolic depolarization of sinoatrial node cells (S 16257-2, 3 x 10(-6) mol/L).

TI  - Inhibition of the pacemaker current: a bradycardic therapy for off-pump coronary operations.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accurate performance of coronary anastomoses on the beating heart requires some form of myocardial immobilization that can be achieved pharmacologically. Different classes of drugs can be used to induce bradycardia, but the most effective in this setting of off-pump operation has not yet been determined. METHODS: Fifty-six isolated buffer-perfused rabbit hearts were divided into seven equal groups. Control hearts were continuously perfused throughout the experimental time course. A second group of hearts underwent 60 minutes of potassium arrest (at 37 degrees C) followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. The following pharmacologic approaches were tested in the remaining five groups: short-acting beta-blockade (esmolol, 6 x 10(-3) mol/L and 3 x 10(-4) mol/L), opening of adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels (nicorandil, 10(-3) mol/L and 10(-5) mol/L), and inhibition of the pacemaker current, which largely accounts for the diastolic depolarization of sinoatrial node cells (S 16257-2, 3 x 10(-6) mol/L). Each drug was infused at a constant rate for 60 minutes, after which hearts were perfused for 1 additional hour with drug-free buffer. Heart rate and isovolumic measurements of function and coronary flow were serially taken during and after drug infusion. RESULTS: The worst recovery of systolic and, moreover, diastolic function was yielded by potassium arrest. Neither esmolol nor nicorandil was able to induce a significant bradycardia. However, nicorandil did not impair function which, conversely, was markedly depressed after esmolol therapy. Significant bradycardia (p < 0.0001 versus corresponding baseline values and versus all other groups) was only achieved with pacemaker current inhibition, which was otherwise associated with an excellent preservation of contractility, diastolic function, and coronary flow. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of the pacemaker current seems to be an effective approach for inducing intraoperative bradycardia without compromising left ventricular function or flow.

TI  - Selective vasodilator effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in the human placental vasculature.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) attenuates the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II (AII), a thromboxane mimetic (U46619), and endothelin-1 in the human fetal-placental vasculature and to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) has a role in the vasodilator activity of ANP. METHODS: Isolated placental cotyledons were dually perfused, with fetal perfusion pressure used as an index of vascular response. The effects of AII (10(-10)-10(-6) mol/L bolus injection), endothelin-1 (10(-7) mol/L bolus), and U46619 (10(-9)-10(-6) mol/L bolus or 10(-8) mol/L infusion) were established in the absence or presence of ANP (10(-8) mol/L). The role of NO as a mediator of ANP action was investigated by perfusion with n-nitro-L-arginine (NNLA, 10(-3) mol/L), an inhibitor of NO synthase. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Atrial natriuretic peptide caused significant attenuation of vasoconstrictor responses to AII, but weak attenuation of endothelin-1 and no attenuation of U46619. Use of NNLA did not affect the attenuation of AII-induced vasoconstriction by ANP. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial natriuretic peptide is a vasodilator of the fetal-placental vasculature constricted with AII and endothelin-1, but not with U46619. Nitric oxide does not mediate the action of ANP.
