TI  - The female Spanish population: a group at risk of nutritional iron deficiency.  
AB  - Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional problems in the world. It is frequent in both developed and developing countries and mainly affects women of childbearing age. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency in a group of young women from Madrid, Spain. The study subjects were a group of 130 women aged between 19 and 35 (24.53 +/- 0.24 years). Measurements were made of iron intake and also of the haematological and biochemical indicators of iron status. 10.7% of subjects showed iron deficiency (defined as the recording of at least two indicator parameters with values below normal). The high incidence of iron deficiency at blood level (10.7%) coincided with the low iron intake of these subjects (11.08 +/- 2.98 mg/day). 98.3% of subjects showed intakes below recommended. Observed intake covered only 61.6% of recommended intake. 3.9% of subjects presented ferropenic anaemia, i.e. they showed both iron deficiency and low haemoglobin levels.

TI  - Testis-derived Sertoli cells have a trophic effect on dopamine neurons and alleviate hemiparkinsonism in rats.  
AB  - Neural tissue transplantation has become an alternative treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. The clinical use of neural grafts as a source of dopamine for Parkinson's disease patients, although beneficial, is associated with logistical and ethical issues. Thus, alternative graft sources have been explored including polymer-encapsulated cells and nonneural cells (that is, adrenal chromaffin cells) or genetically modified cells that secrete dopamine and/or trophic factors. Although progress has been made, no current alternative graft source has ideal characteristics for transplantation. Emerging evidence suggests the importance of trophic factors in enhancing survival and regeneration of intrinsic dopaminergic neurons. It would be desirable to transplant cells that are readily available, immunologically accepted by the central nervous system and capable of producing dopamine and/or trophic factors. Sertoli cells have been shown to secrete CD-95 ligand and regulatory proteins, as well as trophic, tropic, and immunosuppressive factors that provide the testis, in part, with its "immunoprivileged" status. The present study demonstrated that transplantation of rat testis-derived Sertoli cells into adult rat brains ameliorated behavioral deficits in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced hemiparkinsonism. This was associated with enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the striatum in the area around the transplanted Sertoli cells. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced dopaminergic neuronal survival and outgrowth when embryonic neurons were cultured with medium in which rat Sertoli cells had been grown. Transplantation of Sertoli cells may provide a useful alternative treatment for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Indirect calorimetry, body composition and small bowel function in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive women.  
AB  - Extrapolation of data from energy balance studies in HIV-seropositive men to HIV-seropositive women may be inaccurate due to gender differences in body composition, hormones and metabolism. If women have a different metabolic response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), nutritional advice may differ from HIV-seropositive men. Ten asymptomatic HIV-seropositive women were matched with 10 heterosexual female controls from low-risk groups. Subjects and controls had assessment of energy and protein intake, resting energy expenditure (REE) and substrate oxidation, small bowel absorption and permeability and body composition. There were no significant differences in REE, substrate oxidation and body composition. Energy and protein intake and small bowel permeability were increased and sugar absorption decreased in HIV-seropositive women (all P < 0.05). Unlike asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men, asymptomatic HIV-seropositive women do not have significant alterations in metabolism or body composition. Therefore, nutritional advice may need to vary according to the gender of the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subject.

TI  - Toward targets for initiation of chronic dialysis [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To better define the targets for initiation of chronic dialysis, we compared the relationship between the normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA, g/kg standard weight/day) and weekly urea clearance (Kt) normalized to total body water (V) in predialysis chronic renal failure (CRF) patients and in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). We also studied the relationships of other nutritional parameters to weekly Kt/Vurea in CRF patients. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was a prospective observational design meant to study each patient once. SETTING: The University Hospital and Clinics and Harry S. Truman VA Medical Center, Columbia, Missouri. PATIENTS: Forty-five consecutive predialysis CRF patients were enrolled and the results compared with patients on CAPD and HD. RESULTS: In CRF, the nPNA calculated from urea appearance correlated with the weekly Kt/Vurea (r = 0.57, p < 0.0001) and, using exponential best-fit, nPNA = 1.217 x (1-e-0.769Kt/V). This exponential relationship was similar to that for CAPD and both were different from that in patients on HD. Likewise, nPNAs, calculated from Kjeldahl nitrogen output, and weekly Kt/Vurea were correlated (r = 0.37, p = 0.014) and, using exponential best-fit, nPNA = 1.102(1-e-0.867Kt/V), similar to the relationship in patients on CAPD. Evidence is presented that these relationships are not explained only by mathematical coupling. There was a significant correlation between the weekly Kt/Vurea and 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that in CRF, as in CAPD, a weekly Kt/Vurea less than 2.0 is likely to be associated with a nPNA less than 0.9 g/kg standard weight. In CRF patients, initiation of chronic dialysis should be considered if weekly renal Kt/Vurea falls below 2.0 and a nPNA greater than 0.8 is desired.

TI  - Maternal nutrition and socio-economic status as determinants of birthweight in chronically malnourished African women.  
AB  - The birthweight is the most important determinant of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period and may have an influence on health in adult life. The high rate of low birthweight in developing countries is therefore a major health problem. Maternal malnutrition is usually assumed to be a causal factor but other environmental factors are also involved. In this study we analysed maternal nutritional and socio-economic factors as determinants of birthweight in term infants from a rural African society characterised by a high rate of chronic malnutrition. Relations of maternal weight, gestational weight gain, parity, socio-economic status and infant sex with birthweight were analysed in 1,477 women and child pairs. The selected women were followed from early pregnancy and had an uncomplicated delivery at term of a living singleton child. The gestational weight gain was 5.6 (SD 6.0) kg and the mean birthweight 2.933 kg (SD 408). Maternal weight, representing the maternal long-term nutritional situation, was the most important independent determinant of birthweight, accounting for 13.0% of the variance in birthweight. The weight gain, representing the short-term nutritional situation, explained only 5.6% of the variance. Birthweight increased by 20 g (CI 18-23) for each kg maternal weight and by 15 g (CI 12-18) for each kg gestational weight gained. The socio-economic difference in birth-weight was 153 g (CI 109-196) 88 of which (CI 48-128) remained unexplained after adjustment for differences in maternal weight, parity and gender. Improved long-term nutritional situation and living conditions seems to be the most important prerequisites to counteract low birthweight in developing countries.

TI  - Diet and cancer: possible explanations for the higher risk of cancer in the poor.  
AB  - Humans have always had to eat; diets have always contained the same nutrients and bioactive constituents. Therefore, some have argued, the present pattern of diseases and changes in that pattern cannot be causally linked to dietary intake. This argument, its naivety notwithstanding, raises some important issues for the way we think about the epidemiology of nutrition and disease. Current research on diet and specific diseases is based, obviously, on the premise that this argument is false. This chapter uses a broad brush to present the evidence for a significant and causal association between eating patterns and cancer. It shows that, far from being an implausible link, the relationship between dietary patterns and cancer is largely explained by the dependence of humans on their food supply--dependence not merely in the sense of providing energy to sustain life, but more related to evolutionarily adaptive patterns of food intake and contemporary aberrations in those patterns. The chapter also shows that it is plausible that at least part of the explanation for the higher risk of cancer among the poor in both rich countries and poor countries relates to the extent of the aberrations in food supply and eating patterns.

TI  - Biochemical markers of dietary intake.  
AB  - The primary objective of nutritional epidemiology is to identify, in combination with other forms of research, which aspects of diet and nutritional factors are causally related to cancer development. However, traditional epidemiology can evaluate with only a limited degree of specificity to which individual dietary factors an increased occurrence of cancer can be attributed. The two main reasons for this are: (1) dietary intake levels of specific foods or food constituents can be strongly intercorrelated; (2) dietary intake levels of specific food constituents are generally measured with rather large errors. Biochemical markers are increasingly seen as measurements that may help to overcome some of the above-mentioned methodological problems in nutritional epidemiology.

TI  - Nutritional status and survival in end-stage renal disease patients.  
AB  - Several reports have emphasized that putative laboratory surrogates of nutrition, such as serum albumin, creatinine, and cholesterol concentrations are statistically more powerful independent predictors of odds risk of death for dialysis patients than is the delivered dose of dialysis. In view of the relative simplicity with which these blood tests can be obtained, their lack of expense, and simplicity in interpretation, the dialysis community has greatly escalated their importance as performance measures for the processes of patient care, arguably without full consideration of their meaning. If malnutrition in dialysis patients is a powerful predictor of death risk, and is amenable to corrective interventions that result in a reduction in the odds risk of death, then the zeal with which these laboratory tests have been embraced is appropriate. However, the assumption that a statistical correlation between laboratory surrogates of malnutrition, or other measures of inadequate nutrition, such as body mass index or a subjective global assessment, indicate a direct causal relationship between nutritional intake, nutritional status, and outcome may be incorrect. Such apparent linkages may be a consequence of the statistical model selected alone, i.e., another unappreciated medical condition may be the proximate cause of death in addition to resulting in malnutrition. The mechanism(s) by which malnutrition may adversely impact the survival of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is unclear. The impact of milder degrees of malnutrition on patient survival, their proximate effect on survival, and the reality of their independent effect on patient survival are also inadequately defined. Clearly, there is a statistical link between the putative laboratory surrogates of nutrition and patient survival. Regardless of the pathobiology of such a causal link, it is valid to enquire if an intervention that results in a positive change in nutritional parameters enhances patient survival. These issues surrounding nutritional status and survival in patients with ESRD are reviewed here in detail. The conclusion of this critique is that additional studies are needed to determine if malnutrition is truly an independent and responsive predictor of outcome for ESRD patients.

TI  - Odour perception in chronic renal disease.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The sense of smell plays an important role in the quality of life. Many studies have shown a declining odour perception in the elderly, as well as in subjects in poor health or nutritional state. Considering the high prevalence of poor nutritional state in renal disease and the importance of odour perception in nutrition and health, the relationship between renal function, nutritional state, and odour perception is explored in this study. METHODS: A total of 101 patients with chronic renal failure participated in the study. Thirty-eight haemodialysis patients (mean age = 64.3 years) were evaluated both before and after dialysis. Sixteen patients on peritoneal dialysis treatment (mean age = 64.0 years), 28 transplanted patients (mean age = 53.5 years, mean creatinine clearance = 64.0 ml/min) and 19 patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency were also included (mean age = 63.7 years, mean creatinine clearance = 29.5 ml/min). Patients with cognitive deficits or upper respiratory airway diseases were excluded. A validated objective procedure was used to measure odour perception, by determining the detection threshold for isoamyl acetate (banana odour) as the lowest detectable odour concentration. RESULTS: Healthy control persons had significantly lower odour thresholds compared to patients on peritoneal (P = 0.001) and haemodialysis (P = 0.002). No significant difference was observed in odour perception between patients on peritoneal and haemodialysis (P = 0.779) and for patients on haemodialysis before and after a dialysis session. Transplanted patients had significantly better odour perception compared to matched patients on dialysis (P < 0.001). Odour perception of transplanted patients and matched healthy control persons was similar (P = 0.81). In patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, including healthy controls and transplanted patients, a significant positive correlation was found between odour perception and creatinine clearance (P = 0.02). A significant negative correlation was found between odour perception and serum concentration of urea (P < 0.001), serum phosphorus (P = 0.022) and protein catabolic rate (P < 0.05). Other parameters measuring nutritional status (albumin, BMI) were not correlated with odour perception. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the ability to smell is severely impaired in patients with chronic renal failure and is related to the degree of renal impairment and the degree of accumulation of uraemic toxins. After renal transplantation, patients have a normal odour perception, indicating the capacity of the olfactory system to recover once the concentration of uraemic toxins remains below a critical threshold. Acute removal of uraemic toxins by dialysis does not correct olfactory disturbances, suggesting a long lasting effect of uraemia on olfactory function.

TI  - [Artificial nutrition of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome)]  
AB  - The authors report the case of a 30-year-old man treated with toxic epidermal necrolysis. Toxic epidermal necrolysis was due to anticonvulsive drug treatment. The patient was admitted with denudated skin surface similar to second-degree burn that covered 90 per cent of the patient's body surface. The patient was isolated and treated, receiving sterile wound care, broad spectrum antibiotic and corticosteroid. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted until the 5th day of care because the patient was unable to take normal food. The energy intake reached 146 kJ/kg bodyweight containing 4 g/kg bodyweight carbohydrates and 2 g/kg bodyweight fat emulsion supplemented with 10-15 g of nitrogen per day. The enteral nutrition was commenced gradually with decreasing parenteral nutrition.  The nutritive solutions were supplemented with ions, vitamins and trace elements. The patient left the intensive care unit after 23 days of care. The toxic epidermal necrolysis is a life-threatening dermatological disease and should be treated at intensive care unit. The early recognition of the disease, the intensive care and nutritional therapy may improve the survival of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis.

TI  - What determines peak bone mass and bone loss?  
AB  - Bone mass at any point in life represents a balance between the amount of bone laid down during growth and development and the amount of bone lost with ageing. At a cellular level, these changes in bone mass occur as the result of bone remodelling; a process whereby bone resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and bone forming cells (osteoblasts) remove and replace small packets of bone at discrete points throughout the skeleton. This process is in turn regulated by a complex interaction between genetic factors and environmental influences such as nutrition and exercise, which affect bone cell function both directly and indirectly by altering the production of local and systemic hormones that modulate bone cell activity. In this chapter, I shall review the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in regulating bone growth, peak bone mass, and bone loss. Discussion of the genetic aspects shall focus on recent data linking polymorphisms in candidate genes to bone mass and bone loss, and on the possible role which gene-environment interactions may have in regulating these processes.

TI  - Issues in the design and interpretation of studies of fatty acids and cancer in humans.  
AB  - The methods used in nutritional epidemiology to study the relations between fatty acids and cancer risk include ecologic studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, and intervention trials examining either intermediate markers of cancer risk or cancer incidence. Each type of study design has its particular strengths and weaknesses. The inaccuracy of estimates of fatty acid intake from the use of dietary questionnaires linked to nutrient databases is a major limitation in nutritional epidemiology. Information on the concentrations of fatty acids in the circulation or in adipose tissue can complement estimations of dietary intake. Cancer prevention studies now underway are designed to test whole-diet effects on neoplasia and will not be able to separate the effects of specific fatty acids from those of other nutrients in the diet. The development of better intermediate markers of cancer risk could enable the use of experimental methods to assess the relation between specific fatty acids and cancer. Research findings as described in the literature are complicated both by the multiple hypotheses that can be tested when assessing fatty acid effects and by the uncertainties of multivariate adjustment. Although there are substantial obstacles to understanding the relations between fatty acid intakes and cancer risk, there is no better species than humans for inference about diet and cancer risk in people.

TI  - Effects of a long daily photoperiod on milk yield and circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1.  
AB  - Relative to a short daily (24-h) photoperiod, exposure to a long daily photoperiod increases the milk yield of dairy cows. However, the endocrine basis for this phenomenon is unknown. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that a long daily photoperiod is associated with increased circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, a hormone that is galactopoietic in ruminants. Forty lactating cows were exposed to either a natural photoperiod (< or = 13 h of light/d) or to a long daily photoperiod (18 h of light and 6 h of darkness) between January and April 1995. Cows were fed for ad libitum intake a total mixed diet formulated to meet the nutritional demands of lactation. Milk yield and dry matter intake were quantitated each day, and blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture every 14 d. Plasma was harvested and assayed for IGF-I. The long photoperiod increased milk yield relative to the natural photoperiod (36.1 +/ 0.6 vs. 33.9 +/ 0.6 kg/d); the increase became significant after 28 d of treatment and was maintained for the duration of the study. In addition, cows exposed to a long photoperiod had greater circulating concentrations of IGF-I than did cows exposed to the ambient natural photoperiod (60.1 +/ 2.0 vs. 52.6 +/ 2.0 ng/ml). Concentrations of IGF binding protein -2 and -3 in plasma did not differ between treatments. These results support the hypothesis that a long daily photoperiod increases circulating concentrations of IGF-I in lactating cows and reveal a possible endocrine mechanism for the galactopoietic response to a long daily photoperiod.

TI  - The impact of malnutrition in morbidity and mortality in stable haemodialysis patients. Spanish Cooperative Study of Nutrition in Hemodialysis [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: When assessed by single biochemical measurements, malnutrition in dialysis patients is associated with increased mortality, but there are few data evaluating abnormalities in anthropometry or composite nutritional scores and outcome. The aim of our study was to ascertain the prevalence and severity of malnutrition in 761 stable patients from 20 haemodialysis centres and its influence in morbidity and mortality after one year of follow-up. METHODS: Malnutrition was estimated by scoring four anthropometric indexes; body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC); three biochemical measurements; serum albumin, serum transferrin and total lymphocyte count; and clinical examination. Mortality and hospitalizations were collected prospectively during the year of follow-up. RESULTS: A moderate/severe degree of malnutrition was presented by 51.6% of male and 46.3% of female patients. TSF was moderate-severely decreased in 41% without differences between males and females. MAMC was moderately decreased in 19.8% of males and in 8.1% of females (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the predictors of malnutrition were: age > 65 years (OR = 1.96, CI: 1.22-3.14), male sex (OR = 1.95, CI: 1.24-3.07), comorbidity index (OR = 1.23, CI: 1.03-1.45), time on dialysis (OR = 1.13, CI: 1.08-1.18), duration of dialysis (OR = 0.73, CI: 0.63-0.85) and PCR related to ideal body weight (OR = 0.17, CI: 0.06-0.50). After 1 year of follow-up, data from 442 patients were available. A total of 68 patients died (15.4%) with cardiovascular diseases being the most frequent cause of death (57.3% of the cases). The predictors of mortality were: age (OR = 1.06, CI: 1.03-1.09), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.13, CI: 1.19-3.83), neurological disease (OR = 2.96, CI: 1.41-6.15), nephroangiosclerosis (OR = 2.34, CI: 1.10-4.98) and total lymphocyte count (OR = 0.93, CI: 0.87-0.98). Hospitalization was needed in 44% of patients. The comorbidity index, serum albumin and age were the predictive factors of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-calorie malnutrition is frequent in haemodialysis patients. Fat depletion predominated in both sexes. Duration of dialysis and protein catabolic rate related to ideal body weight was the only predictor which could be influenced by a nutritional intervention. Morbidity appeared to be influenced by the comorbidity index and age was the strongest predictor of mortality. The only nutritional measurements predictive of morbidity and mortality were serum albumin and total lymphocyte count respectively. Therefore, the influence of malnutrition in morbidity and mortality can not be definitively stated.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies relevant to the questions were selected. The inclusion criteria were fairly broad because of the quality of the studies located. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction forms were used to collect data from studies included in the review. The data was checked by a second researcher to reduce error. DATA SYNTHESIS: Quantitative analysis was difficult owing to the type of studies located. The data is discussed in a qualitative manner. Where complication rates have been given, we have attempted to combine the results in a quantitative manner. RESULTS: The age and sex of patients on HPN varies according to the underlying disease but, on the whole, patients are young (see Tables 4a and 4b). There are trends showing an increased use of the technology at the extremes of the age range. There are marked differences between countries on the underlying diseases for which HPN is indicated. For example, many more patients with an underlying malignancy are treated in Italy and the USA than in the UK (40-67% versus 8%). Morbidity rates for the majority of patients are acceptable (see Table 8), the complications tend to be related to the central venous catheter. It is fairly clear that a minority of patients are susceptible to recurrent problems and that many patients have very few complications. The mortality rate for HPN patients (see Table 10) was good for those patients with benign underlying disease (for example, 5% of Crohn's HPN patients die per year), and there are very few reports of patients dying from complications of the technology. The survival of those with malignant disease and AIDS is poor, almost all having died from the underlying disease at one year; despite this, most programme growth worldwide is due to an increase in the numbers of patients with these diagnoses (see Table 5). Quality of life is reasonable for patients with benign disease (see Table 9); no studies were found that examined the quality of life of HPN patients with malignant disease. Economic analysis shows that the cost of HPN treatment is cheaper than the alternative of in-patient care (see Table 18). There is a paucity of comparative studies examining different aspects of the technology, and this accounted for the majority of gaps in the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HPN for benign intestinal failure is supported by evidence from the scientific studies located. There are, however, large gaps in the evi

TI  -  Nutrition, insulin and polycystic ovary syndrome.  
AB  - The adverse effects of obesity on reproductive function in women are well recognized, but women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of excessive intake of calories. Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance, the causes of which remain unclear. These metabolic abnormalities are, in turn, related to a disorder of energy expenditure, characterized by reduced post-prandial thermogenesis. It is proposed that these closely interlinked phenomena that, particularly in overweight subjects, are associated with anovulation, may confer a biological advantage for women with PCOS at times of food deprivation, when such women may reproduce more successfully than those without PCOS. A possible causal link between hyperinsulinaemia and ovulation is explored by reference to the interaction of insulin and LH in granulosa cells.

TI  - Testicular leukocytes: what are they doing?  
AB  - Leukocytes, specifically macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells, are found within the testes of most, if not all, mammals. In some species (for example, rats, mice and humans), the number of 'resident' testicular macrophages, in particular, is quite considerable. However, reproductive biologists are only beginning to explore the characteristics and possible biological significance of these cells. As in other tissues, the testicular leukocytes are involved in immunological surveillance, immunoregulation and tissue remodelling. They are implicated in the mechanisms that make the testis a particularly successful site for tissue transplantation in some experimental animals. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that the testicular macrophages have specific trophic effects on Leydig cell development and steroidogenesis. In turn, the development and functions of the testicular leukocyte population are clearly influenced by the testicular environment, and especially by the Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. These data indicate an important role for leukocytes in testicular homeostasis. Balanced against this beneficial role is the fact that these cells possess the potential to damage testicular function in conditions of immune activation, as their inflammatory and cytotoxic activities may disrupt the normal environment of the testis. The importance of the testicular leukocytes to normal and abnormal testicular function is evident. The challenge for future research is to define the details of this relationship.

TI  - Primary caregiver perceptions of intake cessation in patients who are terminally Ill.  
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the meaning of nutrition cessation in adult in-home hospice patients with cancer as described by women primary caregivers during the first year of bereavement. SETTING: In-home hospice in the northeastern region of the United States. SAMPLE: Twelve English-speaking adult women who had cared for patients who were terminally III with cancer who ceased oral intake. DESIGN: Qualitative phenomenologic inquiry. METHOD: Verbatim written transcripts of semistructured interviews were studied line by line to identify themes. Shared themes emerged through ongoing comparison across cases. FINDINGS: Within the framework of transition, seven essential themes emerged: The Meaning of Food, Caregiver as Sustainer, Concurrent Losses, Personal Responses, Ceasing to Be--"Starved to Death," Being Bereaved--The Meaning Now, and Paradox. Patient changes in intake patterns and caregiver actions to encourage intake were described. Decreasing intake led to ongoing and spiraling losses. Caregiver intake patterns also changed. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers believed that patient-nutrition cessation was naturally occurring and not physically painful. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Sensitized nurses can look for the presence of the phenomenon in cancer caregiving families and open dialogue. Anticipatory guidance can serve to normalize the situation and ease the transition. Future research should focus on what nurses know and what they share with families regarding intake cessation. Research with caregivers could address values clarification, decision making, knowledge needed for caregiving, the perceptions of caregiving men, and caregivers of diverse cultures. More research conducted with patients ceasing intake is needed to determine whether and to what degree patients suffer.

TI  - The A3 adenosine receptor mediates cell spreading, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, and distribution of Bcl-XL: studies in human astroglioma cells.  
AB  - The pathophysiological role of the adenosine A3 receptor in the central nervous system is largely unknown. We have investigated the effects of the selective A3 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine, Cl-IB-MECA, in cells of the astroglial lineage (human astrocytoma ADF cells). A marked reorganization of the cytoskeleton, with appearance of stress fibers and numerous cell protrusions, was found following exposure of cells to low (nM) concentrations of Cl-IB-MECA.  These "trophic" effects were accompanied by induction of the expression of Rho, a small GTP-binding protein, which was virtually absent in control cells, and by changes of the intracellular distribution of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL, that, in agonist-exposed cells, became specifically associated to cell protrusions. This is the first demonstration that the intracellular organization of Bcl-XL can be modulated by the activation of a G-protein-coupled membrane receptor, such as the A3 adenosine receptor. Moreover, modulation of the astrocytic cytoskeleton by adenosine may have intriguing implications in both nervous system development and in the response of the brain to trauma and ischemia.

TI  - Effect of high-fat, high-protein, and high-carbohydrate meals on the pharmacokinetics of a small dose of ethanol.  
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether the relative amounts of fat, carbohydrate (CHO), or protein in a meal influence the pharmacokinetics of a small dose of ethanol. METHODS: Nine healthy men received ethanol (0.30 g kg-1 body weight) on five occasions in a randomized cross-over fashion. On three occasions the dose of ethanol was consumed within 15 min of eating a standardized breakfast of similar volume and calorific value but containing different amounts of fat, CHO, and protein. On two other occasions the same dose of ethanol was ingested on an empty stomach (overnight fast) or administered by intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 30 min. RESULTS: The blood-ethanol profiles showed large inter and intraindividual variations, especially when ethanol was ingested after eating food. The peak blood-alcohol concentrations (BAC) were 16.6 +/- 4.0, 17.7 +/- 7.1, and 13.3 +/- 4.0 mg dl-1 (mean +/- s.d.) after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals and 30.8 +/- 4.3 and 54.3 +/- 6.4 mg dl-1 after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The corresponding areas under the concentration-time profiles (AUC) were 1767 +/ -549, 1619 +/- 760 1270 +/- 406 mg dl-1 min after fat, CHO, and protein-rich meals compared with 3210 +/- 527 and 4786 +/- 446 mg dl-1 min after fasting and i.v. infusion, respectively. The time required to eliminate ethanol from the blood was shortened by 1-2 h in the fed-state. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking ethanol after eating a meal, regardless of the nutritional composition, decreases the systemic availability of ethanol. Because gastric emptying is slow and more prolonged with food in the stomach, the delivery of ethanol to the duodenum and the liver will be highly variable as will the hepatic clearance of ethanol. Provided that portal venous BAC remains fairly low and ethanol metabolizing enzymes are not fully saturated then part of the dose of ethanol can be cleared by hepatic first-pass metabolism (FPM), as one consequence of Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics.

TI  - Influences of weight, body fat patterning and nutrition on the management of PCOS.  
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous clinical entity that is defined as the association of hyperandrogenism with chronic anovulation in women without specific underlying diseases of the adrenal or pituitary glands. PCOS is also associated with a metabolic disturbance (insulin resistance). The nature of the complex interrelation of obesity, insulin resistance and endocrine abnormalities in PCOS remains unresolved. However, several studies link obesity, body fat distribution and nutritional habitus with the hormonal and metabolic profiles of PCOS. Moreover, intervention studies have suggested that reducing weight and/or hyperinsulinaemia either by diet alone or by a combination of diet and drugs improves hirsutism, fertility and the hormonal and metabolic profiles of PCOS. In fact, the evaluation of nutritional factors in PCOS is helpful for the screening of metabolic abnormalities and the management of women with PCOS. A point of particular interest in the management of PCOS is that the choice of contraception remains difficult in these high cardiovascular risk women. The impact of pills with ethinyl oestradiol on weight, body fat distribution and carbohydrate metabolism in women with PCOS has not been thoroughly evaluated. The lack of prospective studies to evaluate long-term metabolic and cardiovascular tolerance necessitates care and the assessment of other hormonal possibilities.

AB  - The pathophysiological cause of chronic venous insufficiency with trophic dermal changes is a valvular lesion in the deep and perforating venous system which develops in as many as 72% during recanalization of thrombi. The reduction of reflux by valvuloplasty in the popliteal section with discontinuation of the insufficient perforating vessels (sclerotization) leads promptly not only to marked subjective relief, but on a long-term basis it improves the trophic state of the skin and healing of refractory ulcerations. The technique of valvuloplasty by invagination of the venous wall after its prolongation by the axillary vein with a functional valve rules out venotomy and the use of alien material for suture which would damage the intima, and thus reduces to a minimum the possibility of postoperative thrombosis.

AB  - Organotin compounds including methyl- and butyltin species were determined in selected aquatic specimens (fish muscles, fish liver, mussels, algae) as well as in sediment and water from the mud flats of the German North Sea and the River Elbe. The concentration of tributyltin (TBT) ranged between 27-202 ng/g (fresh mass) in fish muscles, 54-223 ng/g (fresh mass) in fish liver, 10-25 ng/g (fresh mass) in common mussels and 42-97 ng/g (fresh mass) in bladderwrack. The concentration of total organotin compounds (mono-, di-, and trimethyltin + mono-, di-, and tributyltin) in water samples along the River Elbe up to the Elbe estuary ranged between 30-96 ng/l. Retrospective investigation of butylin compounds in mussel samples from the North Sea was performed by the analysis of cryogenically stored samples from 1985. A comparison of the results with that in muscles from 1993 shows that the total tin content and the TBT content decreased from 1985-1993 by a factor of 3.5 and 6.5, respectively. In addition estimated bioconcentration factors (BCF) for organotin compounds in samples from different trophic levels are presented.

TI  - Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in Mexican-American children.  
AB  - To define the clinical and metabolic characteristics of children with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we reviewed the medical records of 18 children and adolescents who met either or both of the following criteria for the diagnosis of the disease: evidence of continued endogenous secretion of insulin beyond that expected in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and satisfactory glycemic control with diet alone or in combination with an oral hypoglycemic agent more than 2 years from the time of diagnosis. Patients who met these criteria but had islet cell antibodies or insulin autoantibodies were eliminated from the study group. Patients with NIDDM constituted 8% of all patients with diabetes seen in our pediatric clinics and 19% of diabetic patients of Central or South American ancestry. Of the 18 patients, 12 (67%) were Mexican American. The mean age of onset was 12.8 years (range, 5 to 17). Obesity (n = 9) and acanthosis nigricans (n = 12) were common findings. Ketonuria was present at diagnosis in 5 (33%) of 15 patients and acidosis in 2 of 14 (14%). Challenge with a nutritional supplement (Sustacal, Mead Johnson Nutritionals) (n = 10) showed a mean fasting serum C-peptide concentration of 1.19 nmol per liter (3.6 ng per ml). A family history of NIDDM was present in 13 (87%) of 15 patients, with 7 (47%) having 3 or more generations affected. Children with NIDDM are an important subset of those with diabetes, and this disease should be suspected in diabetic children presenting without ketoacidosis and with acanthosis nigricans, obesity, and a strong family history, particularly among those of Mexican-American ethnicity. Children with these characteristics should undergo testing of endogenous insulin secretion for appropriate therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Questions regarding the effects of the route of nutrition began to surface shortly after the introduction of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Although TPN has become a life-saving therapy for patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition, it is not the panacea it was hoped to be. It appears that the enteral route of nutrition decreases rates of infectious complications compared with parenteral feeding. Reasons for this phenomenon are not clear, but it seems that enteral nutrition supports the gut barrier and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which may have effects on infections at distant sites such as the lung. These effects do not appear to be due solely to prevention to malnutrition, as the infectious complications develop early after injury or illness. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms does not negate the fact that in many clinical studies the enteral route of nutrition is superior to the parenteral route in terms of reducing infectious complications in critically ill or injured patients.

TI  - Population attributable risk for breast cancer: diet, nutrition, and physical exercise.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The percentages of breast cancer cases in a given population attributable to specific risk factors (i.e., the population-attributable risks) can be calculated; determination of such risks associated with potentially modifiable risks factors, such as diet (e.g., levels of consumption of fruits, vegetables, vitamins, etc.), alcohol consumption, exercise, and body weight, are necessary to focus prevention strategies. METHODS: With the use of data from a case-control study conducted in Italy from June 1991 through April 1994 on 2569 breast cancer case subjects and 2588 control subjects, we calculated multivariate odds ratios and population-attributable risks for breast cancer in relation to dietary beta-carotene and vitamin E intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and, for postmenopausal women, body mass index. RESULTS: Among all subjects, the following attributable risks for the indicated risk factors were observed: 10.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4%-17.0%) for high alcohol intake (i.e., >20 g/day), 15.0% (95% CI = 7.4%-22.9%) for low beta-carotene intake (i.e., <3366 microg/day), 8.6% (95% CI = -0.4%-17.5%) for low vitamin E intake (i.e., <8.5 mg/day), and 11.6% (95% CI = -0.1%-23.3%) for low levels of physical activity. The risks associated with alcohol and beta-carotene intake were larger among premenopausal women, and the risk associated with physical activity was larger among postmenopausal women. Being overweight accounted for 10.2 % (95% CI = 0.2%-20.2%) of breast cancer cases in postmenopausal women. Beta-carotene plus alcohol accounted for 28.1% (95% CI = 16.8-39.4) of the cases. Beta-carotene and physical activity accounted for 32% (95% CI = 14.3-49.8), and these three factors together accounted for 33% (95% CI = 19.9-46.1) of the breast cancer cases in the overall dataset. CONCLUSION: Exposure to a few selected and potentially modifiable risk indicators explained about one third of the cases of breast cancer in this Italian population, indicating the theoretical scope for prevention of the disease.

TI  - Pilot study to enhance start-up of a multicenter nutrition intervention trial.  
AB  - Multicenter trials are important for answering questions that require large numbers of subjects. Such trials require standardized implementation of behavioral change programs across diverse populations, regions, and staff. Researchers involved with the Trial of Nonpharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly conducted a 17-week pilot study of their most complex intervention (combined weight and sodium reduction) before actual start-up of the main study. This allowed staff to rehearse implementing the program and to identify and address intervention and standardization issues. Registered dietitians in 4 US communities recruited 28 participants for the pilot study, using eligibility criteria similar to those for the main trial. Participant evaluations reflected high satisfaction with the program materials and overall approach. Minor protocol changes suggested by results of the pilot study were made easily in time for start-up of the main study. Reductions in weight and sodium intake were less than targeted but were sufficient to suggest that the intervention would be effective under optimal conditions. This partial achievement of goals in the pilot study underscored the need to allow for a learning curve, for without it standardization and outcomes of the main study would be compromised.

PMID- 9478026
TI  - Between a rock and a hard place: methods for setting dietary allowances and exposure limits for essential minerals.  
AB  - For each essential trace element, there are two ranges of intake associated with adverse health effects: intakes that are too low and can lead to nutritional deficits and intakes that are too high and can lead to toxicity. Between these two ranges, there is a range of safe and adequate intakes that is compatible with good health; the challenge is to define that range quantitatively. The exposure limit for toxicity traditionally has been determined by dividing a "no-observed-adverse-effect level," often from studies in experimental animals, by a series of uncertainty factors. Dietary allowances to meet nutritional requirements, on the other hand, have been based primarily on data in humans. Uncertainty, variability and limitations in the data base tend to increase estimates of nutritional requirements and decrease estimated toxic exposure limits, driving the values closer together. Chromium (III) and zinc are contrasting cases. Other factors, such as bioavailability, selection of the critical effect and interactions also can play important roles. Close coordination between the nutrition and toxicology communities, as envisioned in the NRC Food and Nutrition Board initiative on Dietary Reference Intakes, is essential in establishing acceptable ranges of intake for trace elements.

TI  - Programming by early nutrition: an experimental approach.  
AB  - That events during critical or sensitive periods of development may "program" long-term or life-time structure or function of the organism is well recognized. Evidence for programming by nutrition is established in animals, in whom brief pre- or postnatal nutritional manipulations may program adult size, metabolism, blood lipids, diabetes, blood pressure, obesity, atherosclerosis, learning, behavior and life span. Human epidemiological data link potential markers of early nutrition (size at birth or in infancy) to cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in adulthood. However, these retrospective data cannot prove nutritional cause or underpin health policies. After 16 y, however, of ethical, randomized intervention studies of early nutrition in humans with long-term follow-up to test experimentally the nutritional programming hypothesis, we find that humans, like other species, have sensitive windows for nutrition in terms of later outcomes; for instance, perinatal diet influences neurodevelopment and bone mineralization into mid-childhood. Possible biological mechanisms for storing throughout life the "memory" of early nutritional experience and its expression in adulthood include adaptive changes in gene expression, preferential clonal selection of adapted cells in programmed tissues and programmed differential proliferation of tissue cell types. Animal and human evidence supporting nutritional programming has major potential biological and medical significance.

TI  - A review of implications of antiquality and toxic components in unconventional feedstuffs advocated for use in intensive animal production in Nigeria.  
AB  - There are a number of unconventional feed resources in Nigeria. Most are rich sources of plant protein. Since protein is the most expensive and limiting nutrient in tropical livestock nutrition, these unconventional feed resources may fill a gap in protein deficiency. However, most contain antiquality and toxic components which make them unsafe as protein and carbohydrate sources in livestock nutrition. The presence of saponins, lectins, tannins, trypsin inhibitors, cyanogenic glucoside and others in African locust bean meal (Parkia filicoidea Welw), avocado seed meal (Persea americana), bambara groundnut meal (Voandzeia subterranea), cocoa by-product meal (Theobroma coca), coffee pulp meal (Coffee arabica), mango seed kernel meal (Mangifera indica), rubber seed meal (Hevea brasiliensis), sesame seed (Sesamum indicum L) and shear-butter cake (Vitellaria paradoxa, G) are not uncommon and make rations prepared with them unpalatable and unacceptable to animals. They also interfere with nutrient bioavailability and utilization. Drying, soaking, leaching and fermentation are simple means of detoxifying these feed sources to reduce the presence of antiquality and toxic components.

TI  - Practical and realistic approaches to healthier diet modifications.  
AB  - Nutrition research cannot improve people's health until the results influence their purchases and consumption of food and drink. There is much noise in the food information system. The most efficient solution to the problem of insufficient or conflicting public information is for all the data to be critically evaluated by a well-balanced expert committee convened by an authoritative body to produce dietary guidelines for wide publication. Such guidelines in different countries have many similar elements. Guidelines cannot be revised every year, but should be adapted only in response to major new research findings rather than to reports about nutrition in the media, which are no more than trivial distractions. The problems of family physicians giving one-on-one nutritional advice are discussed. For public health nutrition work, dietary guidelines have a range of products such as food guides and health claims on foods that are the tools of nutrition education. In developed countries, consumption of some foods has changed along with the guidelines; consumption of other foods has not. Coronary artery disease mortality has declined but obesity has increased. A more food-based approach to nutrition education is to use ideal diets as the model, such as the traditional Mediterranean diet, Japanese diet, or "hunter-gatherer" diets. These ideal diets would then need to be adapted to our present food preparation technology.

TI  - An increase in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP produces trophic effects on striatal neurons developing in culture.  
AB  - Cyclic AMP-dependent kinases have been suggested to constitute signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of neuronal development and survival. The present study examined whether elevated levels of cyclic AMP exhibit trophic activities on rat striatal neurons grown under serum-free culture conditions. Treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a permeable cyclic AMP, increased GABA uptake and immunocytochemically detectable levels of proteins such as c-Fos and calbindin-D28k. Neuronal survival was promoted by dibutyryl cyclic AMP only in lower density cultures. Chronic exposure of neurons to dibutyryl cyclic AMP enhanced the morphological development of calbindin-D28k-positive neurons. Furthermore, pretreatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP afforded neuroprotection against N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity. The dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced trophic effects above were blocked by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate, a specific inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent kinases. We also examined whether cyclic AMP is involved in trophic effects provided by membrane depolarization induced by high K+ and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1. Depolarization, but not the growth factors, increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate diminished depolarization increases in GABA uptake, whereas it did not affect the trophic effect of the growth factors. Co-treatment with the growth factors and dibutyryl cyclic AMP produced additive effects on both increases in GABA uptake and neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. The present results indicate that cyclic AMP-dependent kinases play roles in mediating differentiation and survival of developing striatal neurons. Signalling pathways activated by either basic fibroblast growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 are independent of those involving cyclic AMP. In contrast, depolarization-induced trophic effects are mediated, at least in part, by cyclic AMP-dependent pathways. Protective actions of dibutyryl cyclic AMP against excitotoxic injury as well as the additive effects with the growth factors are of potential interest in the experimental therapy of acute or chronic neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - The Ste16 WD-repeat protein regulates cell-cycle progression under starvation through the Rum1 protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  
AB  - The haploid cells of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, are arrested in the G1-phase by nitrogen starvation and are committed to sexual reproduction (mating and sporulation). We isolated the sterile mutants which were defective in G1 arrest following nitrogen starvation. Genetic analysis of these mutants defined a single locus designated as ste16. The nucleotide sequence revealed that ste16+ encodes an 82-kDa protein containing eight WD40-repeats in its carboxy terminal half. The ste16 disruptant was viable, but arrested the cell cycle in the G2-phase after the nutritional down-shift. When transferred to fresh growth medium, the G2-arrested ste16Delta haploids resumed the mitotic cycle from the S-phase, resulting in diploidization. This diploidization phenomenon was completely suppressed by the null mutation of rum1 encoding the inhibitor of Cdc2 kinase. As the Rum1 protein level was remarkably elevated in the ste16Delta, the Ste16 protein negatively controls the Rum1 level. The loss of function of ste16 disturbs the cell-cycle progression and impairs the mechanism for the maintenance of ploidy.

TI  - An ecological paradigm for a health behavior analysis of "konzo", a paralytic disease of Zaire from toxic cassava.  
AB  - Konzo is an irreversible paralytic disease afflicting tens of thousands of women and children in rural Zaire and throughout sub-Sahara Africa. The disease can occur where bitter, high-yield varieties of cassava that thrive in arid soils provide the basic nutritional staple. The paraparesis is related to upper motor neuron damage stemming from the consumption of insufficiently processed toxic cassava roots (manioc) and a diet poor in the sulfur-based amino acids necessary for the body to detoxify the cyanide in this plant. The ecological paradigm [Kelly (1968) Toward an ecological conception of preventive interventions, in Research Contributions from Psychology to Community Mental Health, ed. J. W. Carter, pp. 75-99, Behavioral Publications, New York] is adapted as the evaluative model for evaluating the potential effectiveness of a proposed health behavior/education intervention for konzo. This qualitative research model involves a consideration of the cycling of resources (human labor and material), adaptation (of personal and social practices related to the health issue), succession (of social institutions, values, customs), interdependence (of human social units), and feasibility (or the congruency of the proposed intervention and cultural traits of the host environment). Based on this evaluative model, a health behavior/education level of intervention focusing specifically on using focus groups and multichannel communication techniques to discourage unsafe manioc short-soaking tendencies among village women farmers seems feasible. Such an approach is not dependent on sophisticated technical or material inputs and is therefore readily sustainable without outside agency support once it is effectively initiated within that culture.

TI  - Nutritional interventions to prevent intrauterine growth retardation: evidence from randomized controlled trials.  
AB  - This report summarizes the evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of nutritional interventions aimed at reducing intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). There were 12 interventions including protein-energy, vitamin, mineral, and fish oil supplementation, as well as the prevention and treatment of anemia and hypertensive disorders. A primary concern is the limited data supporting the effectiveness of recommended nutritional interventions during pregnancy, some of which are widely used even in women without nutritional deficiencies. Overall, with the exception of perhaps balanced protein/energy supplementation (typical odds ratio: 0.77; 95 per cent confidence interval: 0.58 to 1.01), no effective nutritional interventions for reducing the risk of IUGR have been demonstrated. Other interventions, such as zinc, folate and magnesium supplementation during gestation, merit further research which should be conducted among populations at risk of IUGR, using larger sample sizes, and addressing coexisting factors limiting fetal growth. Appropriate combinations of interventions should be a priority for evaluation as it is unlikely that a single factor will reduce a multicausal outcome like IUGR that is so dependent on socioeconomic disparities.

TI  - Compensatory nutrition-directed mammary cell proliferation and lactation in rats.  
AB  - The proper use of a time-dependent and controlled nutrition regimen during the hormone-sensitive growth phase before first parturition can significantly affect mammary growth and subsequent lactation performance. The objective of the present study was to determine if a compensatory nutrition regimen improves lactation performance by affecting proliferation and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells. Forty female rats (7 weeks of age, average weight 148 g) were assigned to either (1) control, free access to diet or (2) stair-step compensatory nutrition regimen, an alternating 3-4-week schedule beginning with an energy-restricted diet (31.2% restriction) for 3 weeks, followed by the control diet for 4 weeks. Estimated milk yield was greater (P < 0.05) on day 15 of lactation in the compensatory nutrition group than in the control group. Mammary cell proliferation values were 1.4- and 2.7-fold greater in mammary tissue from the compensatory group during pregnant and early lactating stages respectively, compared with those from the control group. Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.17) mRNA was 24% higher (P < 0.05) in mammary tissues of rats from the compensatory nutrition group during pregnancy than in those from the control group. These results indicate that the compensatory nutrition regimen imposed during the peripubertal growth phase stimulated mammary epithelial cell proliferation and improved lactation performance.

TI  - Distribution of the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5 in the postnatal rat brain: an immunocytochemical study.  
AB  - The neurotrophin family of trophic factors influences survival and function of neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Critical information regarding physiological function of these factors may be gained by examining their localization in the brain. Here we report the immunocytochemical characterization of antisera directed against brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin 4/5. These antisera provide important tools to localize the bioactive neurotrophin proteins. Correspondence between protein distribution and previously determined messenger RNA expression was observed in some brain regions, such as hippocampus and cortex. However, neurotrophin proteins were also detected in neurons which have no apparent corresponding messenger RNA, indicating that the proteins may be transported from the sites of synthesis in certain populations. Immunocytochemical double-labelling analysis also indicated that a sub-population of neurotrophin-positive cells were labelled with an astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein) as well, demonstrating that trophic molecules are localized to glial cells as well as neurons in vivo. Thus, the use of antisera specific for individual neurotrophic factors has indicated potential cellular sites of action.

TI  - Fitness and the effect of exercise training on the dietary intake of healthy adolescents.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In healthy, nonobese, adolescent males and females to: (1) Determine the relationship between fitness and energy intake; (2) assess the effect of five-weeks endurance training on energy intake and food choice and (3) compare food record assessments of energy intake with doubly-labeled water (DLW) measurement of total energy expenditure (TEE). DESIGN: (1) Cross sectional analysis of fitness and food intake and (2) Prospective, randomized, controlled interventional study of endurance-type exercise training in 44 females and 44 males (age range, 15-17 y). MEASUREMENTS: Pre and end interventional three day food records were successfully collected from 32 females (15 controls, 17 trained) and 39 males (19 controls, 20 trained). Fitness was assessed from cycle ergometry as peak oxygen uptake normalized both to thigh muscle mass and body weight. Thigh muscle mass was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. TEE using the DLW technique was measured in 12 females (6 controls, 6 trained) and 20 males (10 controls, 10 trained) during weeks 4-5 of the exercise training program (simultaneously with the second assessment of food records). Food record data were analyzed using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System. RESULTS: Fitness was correlated with self reported total caloric intake in males but not females. In females, there was a significant increase in fat intake (19.8+/-9%, P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in carbohydrate intake (-9.8+/-4%) in the trained subjects. No changes were observed in the control subjects. Energy expenditure (2072+/-52 kcal/d) was significantly greater than the estimated energy intake (1520+/-112 kcal/d, P < 0.007) during the intervention in the trained, but not control, subjects. However, there was no weight change in either control or trained subjects. In males, no changes were observed in food choice in either control or trained subjects. Similar to the females, energy expenditure (2425+/-22 kcal/d) was significantly greater than the estimated energy intake (2168+/-117 kcal/d, P < 0.05) during the intervention in the trained, but not control, subjects. No weight changes were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Fitness is associated with increased self-reported energy intake in males but not females, while exercise training led to alterations in food selection (greater fat and reduced carbohydrate) only in females. These observations could reflect specific gender differences, or, alternatively, the generally lower levels of fitness in the females. The apparent negative energy balance without evidence for weight loss in both the trained males and females suggests a systematic under reporting of food intake during exercise programs in adolescents, and indicates the possibility that errors in self reported food intake might be greater during transitions from one level of energy expenditure to another.

TI  - Regulation of the nigrostriatal pathway by metabotropic glutamate receptors during development.  
AB  - Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra heavily innervate the striatum, making it the nucleus with the highest levels of dopamine in the adult brain. The present study analyzes the time course and the density of striatal innervation by nigral dopamine neurons and characterizes the role of the neurotransmitter glutamate during the development of the nigrostriatal pathway. For this purpose, organotypic cultures containing the cortex, the striatum, and the substantia nigra (triple cultures) were prepared from rat brains at postnatal day (PND) 0-2 and were cultured for up to 60 d in vitro (DIV). Dopamine fibers and neurons were labeled using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. Striatal TH-ir fiber density was quantitatively analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In long-term triple cultures (44 +/- 3 DIV), the striatal dopamine fiber density was high and was weakly correlated with the number of nigral dopamine neurons. The high striatal dopamine fiber density mainly resulted from an enhanced ingrowth and ramification of dopamine fibers from nigral neurons during 8-17 DIV. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L-AP-3) selectively inhibited this dopaminergic innervation of the striatum, whereas ionotropic GluR antagonists had no effect. The L-AP-3-mediated inhibition was prevented by the mGluR agonist 1S, 3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD). The inhibition of the striatal dopaminergic innervation by L-AP-3 was further confirmed by anterograde tracing of the nigrostriatal projection with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. These results indicate that glutamate, by acting on group I mGluRs, plays an important "trophic" role for the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared patterns in selected health claims on snack cracker packaging and fat content prior to and following enforcement of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA). METHODS: Through observations at supermarkets in 1991 and 1995, the prevalence on packages of health claims that consumers associate with heart disease prevention was evaluated. The fat content of each product also was recorded. Criteria for potentially misleading claims were developed. RESULTS: Analysis of both cross-sectional data and products that were available in both years showed that fat content, as well as the number of products containing target claims, had significantly decreased by 1995. The prevalence of potentially misleading claims also declined significantly, from 77% in 1991 to 49% in 1995. CONCLUSIONS: Although the data regarding the changes from 1991 to 1995 are encouraging, the prevalence of potentially misleading health claims for this food category continues to be high.

TI  - [Evaluation of the quality of life in artificial nutrition]  
AB  - If we define quality of life as being the social, physiological, mental intellectual, and general well being of people, we realize that there is no known health care system that is able to guarantee that well being in all its possible aspects. When we as clinicians assess the positive effects of a treatment applied to a patient, we are not only assessing the offered quality of life, but also the quantity of life, so what we are really assessing is the usefulness. We could say, therefore, that while the quality of life is subjective, not exact, and cannot be quantified, the usefulness on the other hand, can and should be measured and quantified, even though, as this is a subjective assessment, it is somewhat difficult to quantify. The object of our publication is to find an appropriate method for assessing this parameter in the area that concerns us: artificial nutrition. Artificial nutrition is indicated when the patient cannot does not want to, or does not know how to eat in the natural manner. Therefore, in principle it could seem inhuman and even unethical to deny a vital support measure that is practically without any risks in a patient who cannot feed him-or herself. However, in a situation of limited resources, if the treatment were inappropriate we should consider that possibility. Under these circumstances we could consider that even a concept as essential as nutrition (in this case artificial) would lose its inalienable character. In order to assess usefulness, one must include parameters that can be quantified in percentages and whose results can be set out in units of time (years, months, or days). We use the concept of the individual usefulness, whose unit of time is the QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years). In 1996 we made a personal modification of Rosser's Index, which was specific for evaluating the quality of life obtained by means of artificial nutrition. This consisted of substituting the assessment parameters of intensity of pain, by other that are specific in function of the limitation of the ingestion capacity presented by the patient who was subjected to AN. The third factor that corresponds to the concept of usefulness would be the index of beneficial applicability percentage of patients who benefit from the support. The combination of these three factors, applicability, life expectancy, and quality of life, would yield the usefulness of the procedure. In order to assess usefulness in all its aspects, one must also define intention, as this can be applied with three goals: essential or curative, complementary or adjuvant, and maintenance or merely palliative. We can say that the economical limitations and the cost of the therapeutic resources leads to rationing by the administration. In the face of this action, we would recommend a rational and reasonable restriction of the available resources, which lead to the so-called rationalization, a term that is more correct ethically and esthetically, than rationing. As a final conclusion we could state that ethics and economics help us to use the resources appropriately, without any contradictions, as the economy attempts to give the society the greatest possible degree of well being based on the available resources, and that is an ethical objective, The quantification of the benefits obtained by applying a treatment using measureable units, involves socio-economic concepts such as usefulness, cost/benefit, quality of life, etc. should not elicit rejection as though we were dealing with a merchandising of our ethical values. We clinicians are capable of assessing this together, both with regard to the obtained costs and benefits, and with regard to the final results, both intra- and extra-hospital, and using the appropriate tools, we can reach conclusions that can guide us objectively in making decisions, with the aim of optimizing ou

TI  - Chronic pancreatitis: a historical and clinical sketch of the pancreas and pancreatitis.

Chronic alcoholism, albeit is the most frequent etiologic factor for the disease in most of the affluent nations, a form of CP of undetermined etiology, tropical calculous pancreatitis (nutritional pancreatitis, Afro-Asian pancreatitis, or tropical calculous pancreatopathy) has been recognized to be prevalent in many developing nations. Hereditary pancreatitis inherited as an autosomal dominant disease is reported from all parts of the world. A landmark is the recent discovery of a gene that transmits the disease. Nearly 10% of cases of CP are truly "idiopathic" with no identifiable cause. Recent studies indicate that the idiopathic variety of CP has two subsets--a juvenile form and a senile or late onset form, with distinct clinical features. It is extremely rare to see CP secondary to hyperlipidemia or hypercalcemia. These etiologic associations appear to be overemphasized. Epidemiological studies indicate that alcoholism is growing in incidence all over the world along with an increase in all alcohol-associated disorders such as cirrhosis of the liver or pancreatitis. A genetic predisposition to alcoholic pancreatitis is suspected based on population studies, but not proven. The influence of cigarette smoking in enhancing alcohol-induced injury to the pancreas underscores the health hazard associated with alcoholism and cigarette smoking--two habits that often coexist in many individuals. The recent finding that all forms of CP are premalignant further emphasizes the need to enforce preventive measures. The hope is that CP is a preventable disease. The despair is that alcoholism is increasing and spreads across geographic and religious boundaries.

TI  - [Effect of early postoperative enteral nutrition on postoperative infections]  
AB  - We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that early enteral nutrition might reduce the incidence of serious complications after major abdominal surgery. In a randomized double blind prospective trial 30 patients received Nutridrink and 30 patients received placebo through a nasoduodenal feeding tube. On the day of operation the patients were given median 600 ml nutrition/placebo, 60 ml/h. On the first postoperative day the patients received median 1000 ml nutrition/placebo, second day median 1200 ml nutrition, 1400 ml placebo, third postoperative day median 1000 ml nutrition, 1150 ml placebo and 4th postoperative day median 1000 ml nutrition, 800 ml placebo. All patients were followed for 30 days by the same investigator. The two groups were not different with regard to nutritional status and type of operation. The rate of postoperative infectious complications was significantly lower in the nutrition group, 2/30 compared to 14/30 in the placebo group (p = 0.0009). We conclude that early enteral nutrition given to patients after major abdominal surgery is followed by a major reduction in infectious complications.

TI  - Nutrition and obesity in the chronic mentally ill.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the need for nutrition intervention in a group of people living in mental health residential houses in the Northern Sydney Area. METHOD: A nutrition assessment was conducted by the researcher using a face-to-face interview with mental health residents and a survey on medical background completed by case managers. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was significantly greater than that reported for the general population. Respondents also had a significantly higher prevalence of abdominal obesity than the general population. No respondent met the minimum core food group requirements as outlined in the 12345+ Food and Nutrition Plan. CONCLUSIONS: The needs assessment has shown that nutrition promotion is required in this group. The task ahead is to motivate the group to change their food and nutrition behaviours, where many barriers to a healthy lifestyle exist.

TI  - Alteration in nutritional status and diaphragm muscle function.  
AB  - Diet-induced undernutrition causes deleterious changes in the structure and function of the diaphragm muscle. Diseases associated with somatic washing cause atrophy of the respiratory muscles. In cachectic subjects, the diaphragm muscle mass and thickness are reduced in proportion to the reduction in body weight. In addition, respiratory muscle strength and endurance are reduced more dramatically than the weight loss. This finding suggests that malnutrition induces a reduction in muscular mass which is associated with a decrease in contractility. Diaphragmatic weakness may increase the risk of respiratory failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary goal of a successful nutritional programme is to improve the diaphragm strength by correcting the mineral, electrolyte and energetic disturbances at the muscular level, the latter being responsible for the decreased contractability associated with malnutrition.

TI  - Healthy Start: a comprehensive health education program for preschool children.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy Start is a 3-year demonstration and education research project designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidimensional cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction intervention in preschool centers over a 3-year period of time. METHODS: Two primary interventions are employed. The first is the preschool food service intervention program designed to reduce the total fat in preschool meals and snacks to less than 30% of calories and reduce the saturated fat to less than 10% of calories. The second major intervention is a comprehensive preschool health education curriculum, focused heavily on nutrition. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the intervention will be determined through evaluation of changes in dietary intake of preschool children at school meals and snacks, especially with respect to intake of total and saturated fat. Evaluation of the education component will include assessment of program implementation by teachers, assessment of changes in nutrition knowledge by preschool children, and assessment of changes in home meals that children consume (total and saturated fat content). Blood cholesterol will be evaluated semiannually to evaluate changes that may be due to modification of dietary intake. Growth and body fatness will also be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: While substantial efforts have targeted CV risk reduction and health education for elementary school children, similar efforts aimed at preschool children have been lacking. The rationale for beginning CV risk reduction programs for preschool children is based upon the premise that risk factors for heart disease are prevalent by 3 years of age and tend to track over time, most commonly hypercholesterolemia and obesity, both related to nutrition. Since the behavioral antecedents for nutritional risk factors begin to be established very early in life, it is important to develop and evaluate new educational initiatives such as Healthy Start, aimed at the primary prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in preschool children. The purpose of this publication is to describe the rationale and methods for the Healthy Start project.

TI  - Effect of insulin administration before weaning on reproductive performance in feed restricted primiparous sows.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether exogenous insulin administration in late can improve reproductive performance of feed restricted primiparous sows. A total of 24 pure Large White gilts were assigned at farrowing to one of the three following experimental groups. Control sows (CTRL) were fed on a plane of nutrition close to ad libitum and received 6 kg food day-1. Restricted saline-treated (RS) and insulin-treated (RI) sows received only 4 kg food day-1. Sows from RI group received 0.4 IU insulin per kg of live weight once daily during the 5-day weaning period, whereas CTRL and RS sows received saline injections as a sham treatment. Litters (8-10 piglets) were weaned at 23.5 +/- 1 days post-partum. Blood samples were collected 2 days before (Day W - 2) and after weaning (Day W + 2). Restricted sows RS and RI lost significantly more weight than CTRL sows (25 kg and 32 kg, respectively, vs. 10 kg) and more fat (5.3 mm and 4.7 mm, respectively, vs. 2.2 mm). During insulin treatment, daily litter weight gain was lower in RI than in RS and CTRL groups (P < 0.05). On Day W - 2, insulin concentration was higher, while that of glucose was lower in RI than in RS and CTRL sows (P < 0.05). Concentrations of NEFA and IGF-I were similar in the three groups of sows. On Day W + 2, concentrations of FSH and oestradiol-17 beta did not differ significantly between females of the different groups. Weaning-to-oestrus interval and ovulation rate were similar in CTRL, RS and RI females (5.7, 5.9 and 5.6 days; 19.2, 20.7 and 22.1 corpora lutea, respectively). We concluded that insulin administration during late lactation to feed-restricted primiparous sows did not improve weaning-to-oestrus interval and post-weaning ovulation rate, but was likely to decrease milk production.

TI  - [Iodine nutrition in school children of four census areas of Chile]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although endemic goiter is an easily controlled chronic disease, it continues to be a serious global public health problem. AIM: To study iodine nutrition in school age children from different areas of Chile. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thyroid gland was palpated in 4181 school age children from Calama, Santiago, Temuco and Punta Arenas. Urinary iodine excretion was measured to 9% of these children and iodine concentration in salt for human consumption obtained in each of these areas was determined. RESULTS: A 9% goiter prevalence in boys and 11% prevalence in girls was detected. The prevalence of goiter Ia was 6.5% and the figure in different geographic areas was similar. Iodine concentration in salt for human consumption was adequate according to Chilean legislation (82.6, 95.7, 96.8 and 93.2 micrograms ugI/g salt in Calama, Santiago, Temuco and Punta Arenas respectively). Urinary iodine excretion in boys and girls was 1695 and 1802 micrograms l/g creatinine in Calama, 680 and 732 in Santiago, 574 and 690 in Temuco, 570 and 528 in Punta Arenas. These values are well above recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Endemic goiter is no longer a problem in Chile. The importance of a continuous surveillance of iodine nutrition in Chile and the reduction of salt iodine concentration required by Chilean legislation is underscored.

TI  - Phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.11): a malignancy linked signal transduction enzyme.  
AB  - AIM: To elucidate the relationship between phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) phosphodiesterase, EC 3.1.4.11 (PLC) and transformation, progression and proliferation, steady-state activity was determined in a spectrum of transplantable solid rat hepatomas of different growth rates, and in a variety of normal rat organs. METHODS: To measure PLC activity in the plasma membrane fraction a standard isotopic method was developed using exogenous PIP2 as substrate. PLC activity was linear with time for 2.5 min and proportional with protein concentrations over a range of 5 to 29 micrograms per 50 microliters reaction mixture. RESULTS: The apparent K(m) for PIP2 was 0.3 mM in both normal liver and rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A. PLC activity in adult rat liver was 747 and 986 nmol/h/mg protein; it increased 1.7- to 2.1-fold in hepatomas of slow and intermediate growth rates and 3.7-fold in rapidly growing hepatoma 3924A. By contrast, no significant difference was observed between 24 hours regenerating and sham-operated livers. PLC activity was high in thymus, spleen, testis, bone marrow, lung, brain, heart and renal cortex, but in the same range in skeletal muscle and liver. PLC has a relatively long half-life as there were no significant changes in PLC specific activity in bone marrow during the 9 hour period after intraperitoneal injection of the protein biosynthetic inhibitor, cycloheximide. PLC was subject to nutritional regulation because at 3 days' starvation the specific activity in rat bone marrow decreased to 78% of control values and recovered after 1-day refeeding. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that PLC is a transformation- and progression-linked signal transduction enzyme. This work and recent studies showing increased 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (EC 2.7.1.67) and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5-kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 68) provide evidence of a gain in function for a markedly elevated capacity of signal transduction sequence in transplantable rat hepatomas of different growth rates. Inhibition of the activities of kinases and PLC may provide sensitive targets for selective cancer therapy by down-regulating the up-regulated signal transduction cascade.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a form of nutrition that can be very beneficial, but it does have some indications and complications that should be taken into consideration. With this work we would like to describe the characteristics of our patients with PN, as well as their follow up, and to evaluate the appropriateness of its prescription. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study carried out at a hospital with 415 beds. All patients who received PN during the first six months of 1996 were reviewed. Inadequacy criteria are established and a nutritional assessment was carried out by means of clinical and analytical parameters. Catheter infections were recorded according to specific criteria and the clinical and analytical evolution of the patients was followed. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were given parenteral nutrition. The most frequent indication was prolonged fasting after a surgical resection of the digestive apparatus. The most common nutritional status when beginning the PN was severe protein malnutrition (23%). There were 33 cases (39.7%) of PN that was not indicated and/or potentially avoidable. A catheter infection was reported in 7 cases (8.4%).

TI  - Effects of medium- and long-chain triglycerides on sleep and thermoregulatory processes in neonates.  
AB  - Sleep processes and body temperature regulation of neonates are never taken into account in the evaluation of nutrients, although these functions are implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism and are influenced by the nutritional state and its metabolic consequences. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are currently used in paediatric units during the first weeks of because they are considered to be a rapid source of energy, easy to assimilate for growing premature infants, whose digestive function is immature. However, no study has described the thermic effect of these nutrients on body temperature regulation and sleep. The present study aimed at analysing the influence of three feeding formulas with different content of MCT on sleep processes and on thermoregulation of neonates fed until desired intake was reached. Whatever the thermal conditions (thermal equilibrium or cool environment), the MCT-fed groups had higher body temperatures and than groups fed without MCT, for whom total sleep time was reduced at thermal equilibrium. In this group, the large amount of quiet sleep seems to favour a strategy of conserving energy. Higher energy expenditure in MCT-fed groups is not harmful to growth rate since nutritional efficiency is even better reflected by a larger body mass gain. The thermic effect of MCT contributes to lessening the vulnerability of neonates exposed to low incubator temperatures.

TI  - Why do patients with weight loss have a worse outcome when undergoing chemotherapy for gastrointestinal malignancies? [see comments]  
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether weight loss at presentation, in patients who were to receive chemotherapy for gastrointestinal carcinomas, influences outcome and whether nutritional intervention would be worthwhile. This study was a retrospective review of prospectively gathered data. The outcomes of patients with or without weight loss and treated for locally advanced or metastatic tumours of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon or rectum were compared. In 1555 such consecutive patients treated over a 6-year period, weight loss at presentation was reported more commonly by men than women (51 versus 44%, P = 0.01). Although patients with weight loss received lower chemotherapy doses initially, they developed more frequent and more severe dose limiting toxicity--specifically plantar-palmar syndrome (P < 0.0001) and stomatitis (P < 0.0001)--than patients without weight loss. Consequently, patients with weight loss on average received 1 month (18%) less treatment (P < 0.0001). Weight loss correlated with shorter failure-free (P < 0.0001, hazard ratio = 1.25) and overall survival (P < 0.0001, hazard ratio = 1.63), decreased response (P = 0.006), quality of life (P < 0.0001) and performance status (P < 0.0001). Patients who stopped losing weight had better overall survival (P = 0.0004). Weight loss at presentation was an independent prognostic variable (hazard ratio = 1.43). The poorer outcome from treatment in patients with weight loss appears to occur because they receive significantly less chemotherapy and develop more toxicity rather than any specifically reduced tumour responsiveness to treatment. These findings provide a rationale for attempting randomised nutritional intervention studies in these patients.

TI  - Feasibility of noninvasive mechanical ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in postoperative cancer patients.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with cancer who require mechanical ventilation have high mortality rates. Although oncological patients have multiple clinical problems, including nutritional and immunological deficiencies, added complications from mechanical ventilation by themselves may be life-threatening and may further compromise the ability of these patients to recover from an episode of acute respiratory failure (ARF). Noninvasive mechanical ventilatory support (NIMV) using positive-pressure-ventilation delivered through a mask has gained popularity for the treatment of ARF and may limit some mechanical ventilation complications. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate NIMV in cancer patients with ARF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from August 1, 1994, to April 15, 1996, with hypoxemic or hypercapnic ARF were eligible for this study. NIMV was delivered with the BiPAP S/T-D (Respironics, Murrysville, PA) device. The initial settings were adjusted to achieve a tidal volume of 5 to 7 mL/kg and a SaO2 greater than 0.90. Demographic data, duration of therapy, and need for endotracheal intubation were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in this study. There were 21 women (35%) and 39 men. The primary cancer sites of these patients were gastrointestinal (25 patients), genitourinary (15), hematological (8), lung (6), sarcoma (4), and skin (2). Fifty-three patients (88%) had hypoxemic ARF and 7 had hypercapnic ARF. The mean duration of NIMV was 1.83 days (range, 1 to 5 days) with a median of 2 days. Forty-two patients (70%) were weaned from NIMV and were spared endotracheal intubation. The remaining 18 patients deteriorated and ultimately required intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation. No complications related to the use of NIMV were seen in this study population. CONCLUSIONS: NIMV was effective in the treatment of ARF in cancer patients at our institution substantially decreasing the need for intubation. This ventilatory technique is a viable option for cancer patients with ARF.

TI  - Longitudinal evaluation of bone mineral density in children receiving chemotherapy [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Some children who survive a childhood malignancy have diminished bone mineral density (BMD). The purpose of this study is to assess when, and perhaps why, this problem develops. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BMD was longitudinally monitored in 37 children for a minimum of 1 year (mean, 23.4 months; range, 12 to 41 months) during and, in some cases, after chemotherapy. Evaluations included serum analyses (vitamin D, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase), assessment of calcium intake, and measures of growth and nutrition (height, weight, and skinfolds). RESULTS: BMD was already diminished at the start of treatment in some patients; 6 of 13 patients (46%) had a BMD z score in the hip or spine of < -1.0. However, only 1 patient (8%) was < -2.0. Most patients did not have a significant drop in BMD z scores during chemotherapy, but one in four did decrease at least 0.5 standard deviations. Age greater than 10 years, a drop in height z score, and treatment with cranial irradiation correlated with a drop in BMD z scores during treatment. In the year immediately after completion of chemotherapy, no consistent "catch-up" was observed in BMD z scores. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients, BMD z scores are diminished at the time of diagnosis and a drop may occur during treatment in others. Multiple factors related to the disease process and treatment likely contribute to these observations. Cranial irradiation, perhaps by impacting on growth hormone homeostasis, is one such factor. Fortunately, most survivors of a childhood malignancy will not have large deficits in BMD later in life.

TI  - Dose-dependent pancreatotrophic effect of cholecystokinin-octapeptide in the rat: the influence of starvation.  
AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) and its analogues are known to exert trophic effects on the exocrine pancreas, whereas at high doses, they produce pancreatic injury. This study was carried out to study the effect of starvation on the dose-dependent pancreatotrophic effect of CCK-8 in rats. Normal or fasted rats were treated with CCK-8 doses ranging from 0.5 to 32 and 0.5 to 8 micrograms kg-1, respectively, twice daily for 5 days. Pancreatic size, protein, DNA, secretory enzyme and trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) contents as well as histology were examined. In normal rats, CCK-8 increased the pancreatic content of protein, amylase, serine proteases and PSTI with maximum values between doses of 2 and 16 micrograms kg-1. The dose of 32 micrograms kg-1, however, yielded less trophic responses. Given to fasted rats, CCK-8 increased the weight as well as protein and secretory enzyme contents of the pancreas with maximum values between doses of 1 and 4 micrograms kg-1. The first dose supramaximum for the trophic responses was as low as 8 micrograms kg-1. Histology revealed necroinflammatory damage (acinar cell vacuolization, focal cell necrosis) in the exocrine pancreas at supramaximum doses of CCK-8 in both groups. Cell necroses and vacuolization were less but present even at doses optimum for trophism and exhibited dependence on both the dose of CCK-8 and nutrition. In either the normal or fasted animals, the periinsular acini were relatively less affected by the toxic effects of CCK-8 than the teleinsular ones. The results indicate that starvation makes the exocrine pancreas more sensitive to necroinflammatory effects of CCK-8. The relative protection seen in periinsular acini suggests a modulatory influence of islet hormones on development of CCK-induced acinar cell injury.

TI  - Mercury in environmental samples from a waterbody contaminated by gold mining in Colombia, South America.  
AB  - Environmental samples from a marsh, which receives mercury discharges from a gold mine in Colombia (South America), were evaluated for total mercury content. Mercury concentrations were analyzed in sediments, macrophytes and fish species from different trophic levels. The Mean mercury levels in sediments oscillated between 140 and 355 micrograms/kg whereas in the macrophyte Eichornia crassipes levels were between 219 and 277 microgram/kg with practically no interseasonal variations. The mercury content in the muscle of fish varied depending on the position in the trophic chain and the feeding habits of each species, oscillating between non-detectable (< 7.4 microgram/kg) and 1084 micrograms/kg. Seasonal variations were only observed in fish species whose habitats are mostly the bottom sediment. The presence of mercury in some fish appeared to be the result of bioaccumulation rather than a biomagnification processes. This was clearly evidenced in the detritivorous species Triportheus magdalenae which obtain their food within the sediments and whose mercury concentrations were significantly higher when compared to the other species including carnivorous. The relatively low mercury concentrations found in fish may be due to both the dispersion of the contaminant once it reaches the waterbody and the migrational characteristics of the fish species.

AB  - The objective of this work was to design a test to measure the degree of knowledge on food and nutrition in school-age children from elementary first and second grades. A graphic instrument was designed according to the psychological child development and was based on the specific objectives pursued by the curriculum programs of the Ministry of Education. The test was developed around the following topics through 15 items: Area 1: Basic Concepts on Food and Nutrition (9 items) and Area 2: Food, Personal and Environmental Hygiene (9 items). The test was pilot tested on 103 school-age children of both grades (1:1), of both sexes (1:1), belonging to Penalolen and Las Condes counties from Chile's Metropolitan Region and from high and low socioeconomic status (SES) (1:1), measured through the Graffar's Modified Method. The final version of the test was applied in a representative sample of 1.482 school-age children from Chile's Metropolitan Region from elementary first and second grades during 1986-1987. Content validity was assured by a team of judges and by the curriculum programs. Reliability was assessed by the Spearman correlation with the Spearman-Brown correction. Item-test consistency was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Data were processed by the statistical analysis system (SAS) package. Results showed that reliability coefficient was 0.84 and item-test consistency was equal or above 0.25 in all items. It can be concluded that this test can be useful to determine the degree of knowledge on food and nutrition at the onset of elementary school, both in Chile and in other countries.

TI  - Effects of supplementation with a combination of antioxidant vitamins and trace elements, at nutritional doses, on biochemical indicators and markers of the antioxidant system in adult subjects.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the impact of supplementation with nutritional doses of antioxidant nutrients on biochemical indicators of vitamin and trace element levels. DESIGN: A randomized double-blind trial was performed comparing two groups receiving daily either a combination of vitamins (beta-carotene, 6 mg; vitamin C, 120 mg; and vitamin E, 30 mg) and trace elements (zinc, 20 mg; and selenium, 100 micrograms); or a placebo. SUBJECTS: 401 subjects (166 males aged 45 to 60 years and 235 females aged to 35 to 60 years). MEASURE OF OUTCOME: Biological markers of vitamin and trace element status and free radical parameters were measured initially, 3 months, and 6 months after supplemention. RESULTS: Mean serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, beta-carotene, zinc and selenium increased significantly after 3 months of supplementation in the group receiving multivitamins associated with minerals. At baseline, 18.2% of the men and 5.1% of the women had low concentrations of serum vitamin C (< 20 mumol/l): 2.4% of the men and 17% of the women presented low concentrations of serum retinol (< 1.4 mumol/l): 18.7% of men and 10% of women had serum beta-carotene < 0.30 mumol/l. None of the study subjects had serum alpha-tocopherol concentrations below the limit cut-off point (< 9.3 mumol/l). Low serum zinc concentrations (< 10.7 mumol/l) were found in 15.1% of men and 23.8% of women. Low serum selenium concentrations (< 0.75 mumol/l) were found in 6% of men and 6.4% of women. A significant increase in plasma and red cell GPx activity was observed in groups receiving supplementation. No modifications were observed after 6 months of supplementation for malondyaldehyde. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the efficacy of an intake of antioxidant vitamins and trace elements, given at nutritional doses, on biochemical indicators of vitamin and trace elements status.

TI  - The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus revisited: 1998 update.  
AB  - This article reviews data that have accumulated since the early 1970s on the role of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) in neuroendocrine and autonomic homeostasis. Both the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) project to the DMN, which in turn projects to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), thus placing the DMN at an important nodal point of neuroendocrine/autonomic circuitries. The DMN is composed of cells and fibers containing neuropeptide Y (NPY), and the nutritional status (starvation-refeeding) is reflected in NPY levels of both VMN and DMN in Sprague-Dawley, Zucker (fa/fa), and corpulent rats (cp/cp JCR:LA). The DMN is involved in the final common pathway of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion by the PVN, sympathetic nervous system outflow to the adrenal gland, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. The DMN is also part of a "fear circuitry" regulating cardiovascular responses to stress such as myocardial blood flow and the tachycardia associated with the defense reaction. This appears to be mediated by a gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) mechanism. Although exhibiting reduced ponderal and linear growth and hypophagia and hypodipsia, the rat with DMN lesions (DMNL rat) has normal body composition, anabolic hormone levels, and intermediary metabolism, and it responds normally to numerous endocrine, nutritional, intra- and extracellular thirst and body weight-regulatory challenges. The DMNL rat shows normal efficiency of food utilization, but shows an attenuated response to the feeding-stimulatory effect of insulin. The only other lesion-induced abnormalities are hyperprolactinemia and a disrupted circadian corticosterone rhythm. The hyperprolactinemia in DMNL rats appears to be related to an attenuation of dopamine (DA). Rats with DMNL are capable of mating and can bear offspring, but there is a dramatic effect on litter size and other litter parameters that only improves when one parent is a DMNL rat. Antiaging effects produced by DMNL are evident in the prevention of age-associated microalbuminuria and kidney lesions, as well as, in prevention of the age-related decline in circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Recent evidence suggests that DMN, together with the VMN and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, may be part of the circuitry that is responsive to the feedback signal from adipose tissue by the hormone leptin. The above findings and others suggest that the DMN plays a diverse role in physiological regulatory processes.

TI  - The aging gut. Nutritional issues.  
AB  - With improvements in health care, living standards, and socioeconomic status, more adults are living to old age. As the population ages, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that affect the nutritional status and thus the health status of older adults. Many factors contribute to inadequate nutrition, including health status, financial capacities, mobility, exercise, and physiologic needs. This article considered only the potential changes in nutritional needs because of alterations in the gastrointestinal tract owing to aging. One of the most remarkable changes with aging is the frequent development of atrophic gastritis and the inability to secrete gastric acid. This process affects approximately a third of older adults in the United States and only recently was recognized to be due to infection by H. pylori in the majority of cases. The lack of gastric acid in atrophic gastritis may lead to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and influences the absorption of a variety of micronutrients, including iron, folate, calcium, vitamin K, and vitamin B12. Lactose maldigestion is a frequent condition in older adults and is extremely common worldwide. The intolerance of dairy products leads to avoidance of these foods and likely contributes to the development of osteopenia. Overall, the small intestine and pancreas undergo astonishingly few clinically significant changes with aging. The relative preservation of overall gastrointestinal function with aging is likely due to the large reserve capacity of this multiorgan system. Further research is needed to define the precise nutritional needs for older adults because simple extrapolation of values from younger adults is now recognized to be insufficient. In addition, it is no longer acceptable to define adequate nutriture in terms of amounts of vitamins needed to maintain serum levels of a nutrient. Further RDAs must consider the functional implications of adequate nutrition. Nutrients in the elderly will be measured as to whether they result in improvements in markers of chronic disease such as homocysteine or, most importantly, in the prevention of chronic disease such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.

TI  - [Extreme decrease of serum total cholesterol and other lipid levels in elderly inpatients]  
AB  - In this study 112 elderly inpatients (55 men, 57 women) were recruited. 1. Twelve elderly inpatients (5 men, 7 women) aged 82.5 +/- 7.4 years (M +/- SD) were investigated during 3 periods of dietary intake: good intake (period I), tube nutrition (period II) and fasting with intravenous fluid infusion (period III). Calorie, protein, carbohydrate, fat and cholesterol intakes were greater in period I than in periods II and III. Serum total and LDL cholesterols were lowest in period III, when serum HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and total protein were lower in period III than in period I. 2. One hundred elderly inpatients (50 men, 50 women) were divided into 4 groups according to type of decreased serum lipid and a control group. Serum total cholesterol only was decreased in group I, both serum total and HDL cholesterols were decreased in group II, both serum total cholesterol and triglyceride were decreased in group III, all 3 lipids were decreased in group IV and lipid levels did not change in the control group. There were 5 patients in group I, 28 patients in group II, 20 patients in group III, 27 patients in group IV and 20 patients in the control group. The patient's age ranged from 80.3 to 88.4 years and body mass index ranged from 14.7 to 18.4 kg/m2. Serum total protein decreased significantly in groups II-IV, to 5.6 to 5.7 g/dl. Serum total protein, and total cholesterol correlated positively (r = 0.525, p < 0.01), as did Calorie ingestion and serum total cholesterol levels (r = 0.554, p < 0.001). Therefore, severe hypocholesterolemia was accompanied by malnutrition and a decrease in Calorie or cholesterol intake. Serum total cholesterol levels during observation decreased most in group IV, followed by group II similar to serum HDL cholesterol levels. The amount of nutrient intake was smallest in group IV resulting in an extreme lowering of all 3 serum lipid levels.

TI  - Feedlot health and management.  
AB  - Health programs based solely on vaccination and treatment regimens are often short-lived and unrewarding. The basis of any successful ongoing health program is a working health management system. The key to the success of the system is a functioning record system that generates information meaningful to management. The basic information generated should include morbidity and mortality data categorized by cause, the number of repeat treatments, and the number of chronic animals or railers. Goals should be set for each major category so that a database can be established for a feedlot operation to assess problems and progress. The most common reason for expectations not being achieved is factors that are largely beyond the control of the feed yard. Although attempts to address these factors should be periodically reviewed, attention to the health program and potential modifications are among the factors that we can control and modify as appropriate. BRD is the most important economic disease in the feedlot. Prearrival management is extremely important in assessing the risk category of incoming calves and in applying a preventive health strategy. Good husbandry, proper nutrition, proper pen maintenance, and selective immunization help to ensure that the cattle adapt quickly to the feed yard environment. Careful observation, timely effective therapy, and excellent hospital management increase the opportunity to produce cost-competitive, safe, and wholesome beef in a humane fashion with limited effects of the environment.

TI  - Evidence for GnRH regulation by leptin: leptin administration prevents reduced pulsatile LH secretion during fasting.  
AB  - Administration of leptin during undernutrition improves reproductive function, but whether this occurs at the level of the brain, pituitary, or gonads is not yet clear. The present study tested the hypothesis that one important mechanism is the control of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Our approach was to determine if leptin could prevent the marked suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion which occurs during fasting. Leptin (3 micrograms/g i.p.; three times/48 h) or vehicle was administered during a 48-hour fast in adult ovariectomized and estrogen-treated ovariectomized rats (n = 5-7/group). LH was measured in blood samples collected every 6 min for 2 h before and after fasting. In vehicle-treated animals, plasma insulin and leptin levels decreased after fasting. As expected, the LH pulse frequency also decreased markedly. When circulating leptin remained artificially elevated during fasting, the suppression of LH pulse frequency did not occur. Leptin treatment maintained a high LH pulse frequency in the presence or absence of estrogen. The finding that leptin modulates LH pulse frequency indicates that this fat-derived hormone conveys information about nutrition to mechanisms which regulate pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Because this occurs in the absence of estrogen, the mechanism does not necessarily involve modulation of negative feedback.

AB  - Genetic factors explain a high proportion of the age-specific differences in bone density, size and turnover. The potential for interaction between hormonal, diet and lifestyle factors is likely to be important. Common allelic variation in the VDR is an example of normal gene variants altering Ca homoeostasis, with effects on body and bone size as well as bone density. The VDR findings suggesting interactions between genetic and nutritional factors are an important target for future research. These studies are complicated by the potential for effects of gene-gene interactions and of undefined environmental factors. These problems notwithstanding, considerations of environmental and nutritional contributions, such as Ca intake and vitamin D status, will be critical in interpreting these genetic pathways and in 'personalizing' nutritional recommendations.

TI  - An extracellular meiosis-promoting factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Meiosis and sporulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been classically viewed as an example of unicellular, eukaryotic differentiation that occurs in response to nutritional starvation. We present evidence that S. cerevisiae produces an extracellular factor(s), called meiosis-promoting factor (MEP), that is required, in addition to starvation conditions, for efficient meiosis and sporulation. This factor is secreted and accumulates in a cell density-dependent fashion such that cells at a low density sporulate poorly under conditions in which cells at a high density sporulate efficiently. Conditioned medium from sporulating cells at a high density contains a small anionic molecule that has cytostatic activity and stimulates sporulation of cells at low density under a normal starvation condition. These results indicate that MEP-mediated social communication between cells is required for meiosis and sporulation.

TI  - Maternal nutrition in twin gestations: weight gain, cravings and aversions, and sources of nutrition advice.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition has a strong influence on singleton and twin birthweight. This study evaluated the association between twin birthweight and maternal pregravid body mass index (BMI), weight gain, and cravings and aversions. Information was also obtained regarding sources of nutrition advice and advised versus actual weight gain. METHODS: This study is based on data from interviews with 928 mothers of twins. Univariate analysis included comparisons by source of nutritional advice, birthweight categories, and categories of cravings and aversions. Multiple logistic regression was used to formulate models for mean twin birthweights > 1,500 g and > 2,500 g. RESULTS: Mothers who received their nutrition advice from a registered dietitian had the highest weight gains and the lowest proportion of birthweights < 1,500 g. For mean twin birthweight > 2,500 g, the final model included prematurity, pregravid BMI, and weight gain; for birthweights > 1,500 g, the model additionally included maternal age and aversions. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal pregravid BMI and gestational weight gain were shown to be important factors influencing twin birthweight. Nutrition advice, particularly from a registered dietitian, may be vital in assuring adequate weight gain, and therefore better birthweights, for these high-risk pregnancies.

TI  - Effects of a milk product, fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus and with fructo-oligosaccharides added, on blood lipids in male volunteers.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in adult male volunteers the effect of a new fermented milk product, fermented by Lactobacillus acidophilus and with fructo-oligosaccharides added, on blood lipids. DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind two-way cross over trial with two treatment periods of three weeks, separated by a wash-out period of one week. SETTING: the study was performed at the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute in Zeist, The Netherlands. SUBECTS: Thirty normal healthy men, aged 33-64y (mean serum total cholesterol level: 5.23 +/- 1.03 (s.d.)), were selected for this study. Normal health was assessed by pre study screening. All subjects were used to an average Dutch food pattern. INTERVENTIONS: During the treatment periods subjects consumed three times daily a 125 ml of either test or reference product as a part of their habitual diet. The test product was a milk, fermented by yogurt starters and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and contained 2.5% fructo-oligosaccharides, 0.5% vegetable oil and 0.5% milk fat. The reference product was a traditional yogurt (milk fermented only by yogurt strains), containing 1% milk fat. Blood samples for serum lipid analysis and blood glucose measurements were taken before the start of the experiment and at the end of both treatment periods. RESULTS: As compared to the reference product, consumption of the test product resulted in significantly lower values for serum total cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.005), and the LDL/HDL-ratio (P < 0.05) by 4.4, 5.4 and 5.3% respectively. Levels of serum HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose remained essentially unchanged. The beneficial effects of the test product on serum cholesterol were largely related to an increase of this parameter during the consumption of the reference product. CONCLUSIONS: As compared to traditional yogurt, daily consumption of three times 125 ml of test product specifically lowered serum LDL-cholesterol levels in normal healthy male adult subjects with borderline elevated levels of serum total cholesterol within three weeks.

AB  - Food habits change over time. This paper reports results of nutritional studies among 5-year-old urban black children in 1984 and 1995 in the Johannesburg/Soweto area. The objective was to compare energy, macro- and micronutrient intake of 5-year-old urban black South African children. Dietary intake was assessed by detailed dietary histories in 1984 and food frequency questionnaires in 1995, conducted by trained interviewers. The intake of energy, macro- and most micronutrients was higher in 1995 than in 1984, except for vitamin A, ascorbic acid, copper and iron. Fat intake increased from 52 g/day in 1984 to 95 g/day in 1995. Only biotin and vitamin D fell below 67% of the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for 4- to 6-year-olds, but mean intakes concealed the high percentage of children that had intakes below the RDA in 1984 and 1995. Urban black 5-year-old South African children consumed a low-fat (30% of total energy), high-carbohydrate (61% of total energy) diet in 1984, but a typical westernised diet by 1995 (fat 41% and carbohydrate 52% of total energy). With these changes, current reliable nutrition information is needed to assess the existing and future health needs of all South Africans.

TI  - Role of glutamine in immunologic responses.  
AB  - Glutamine has traditionally been thought of as a nonessential amino acid, but laboratory and clinical data suggests that it may be essential during certain inflammatory conditions, such as infection and injury. Glutamine is a necessary nutrient for cell proliferation, serves as a specific fuel for inflammatory cells and enterocytes, and, when present in appropriate concentrations, enhances cell function. During inflammatory states, glutamine consumption may outstrip endogenous production and a relative glutamine deficiency state may exist. Animal and clinical studies suggest that improved outcome may be possible by providing the appropriate dose of this nutrient by the appropriate route to achieve adequate tissue concentrations. Such an approach prevents patients from being exposed to some of the inadequacies of present day conventional nutrition. The overall benefit of providing an appropriate glutamine-supplemented diet to all metabolically compromised patients arises from the multiple anabolic and host protective effects of this amino acid, of which immunomodulation is only one important facet of glutamine's essential nature.

TI  - Risk factors for early childhood malnutrition in Uganda.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the dietary and environmental factors influencing stunting and other signs of poor nutritional status of children <30 months of age in a central Ugandan community, whose main dietary staples are banana (matoki) and maize. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey using stratified multistage random sampling to select households with a child <30 months of age in rural and semi-urban environments. A questionnaire was administered to mothers of 261 infants and toddlers in their home setting. Their health status was assessed by clinical examination and anthropometric measurements (mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC], weight, and supine length). RESULTS: A large minority (21.5%) of the children surveyed were found in poor health after clinical examination: 3.8% being classified as suffering from kwashiorkor and 5.7% with marasmus. A high proportion of children were stunted (23. 8%), underweight (24.1%), or had low MUAC (21.6%). Although rural living, poor health, the use of unprotected water supplies, lack of charcoal as fuel, lack of milk consumption, and lack of personal hygiene were shown as risk factors for marasmus and underweight, different factors were found to be associated with risk of stunting and low MUAC, despite these three parameters being significantly correlated. For stunting the risk factors were: age of the child, poor health, prolonged breastfeeding (from >18 months to <24 months), low socioeconomic status of the family, poor education of the mother of infants <12 months, lack of paraffin as fuel, consumption of food of low energy density (<350 kcal/100 g dry matter), presence of eye pathology, and consumption of small meals. Risk factors for low MUAC were poor health, lack of meat and cow's milk consumption, low intake of energy from fat, and less well educated and older mothers. Food taboos had no influence on any of the anthropometric measurements. Although 93.1% of the children had been immunized against tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, and measles and showed better general health than children who were not immunized, there was a high prevalence of infection in the week preceding the survey interview, including diarrhea (23.0%), malaria (32.3%), or cough/influenza (72.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This first account of dietary and environmental risk factors involved in the etiology of early childhood malnutrition in Uganda indicates differences in risk factors for marasmus and underweight compared with stunting and low MUAC. The high prevalence of malnutrition and current infection of children in this survey suggests poor immune function as a result of inadequate nutrition.

TI  -  Nutritional intervention and growth in children with chronic renal failure.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether improving energy intake by tube feeding could prevent growth failure and improve growth rates in children with congenital renal failure. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. SETTING: Renal Units, Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, and Westmead Hospitals. PATIENTS: All children with advanced chronic renal disease (glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) between 1992 and 1994. INTERVENTION: Tube feeding was commenced if height or weight standard deviation score (SDS) was below the normal range (> -2 SDS) or when height SDS was decreasing and oral intake was not meeting energy requirements. Energy requirements were calculated for median weight for chronological age and sex to provide for catch-up growth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth rate was measured by comparing height and weight SDS at the beginning and end of the study period. Normal growth rate is defined as no change in SDS over time, whereas catch-up growth is defined as an increase in SDS over time. RESULTS: Seven children, mean age 0.6 +/- 0.7 years, with advanced renal failure (mean glomerular filtration rate = 17 mL/min/1.73 m2) caused by congenital renal hypoplasia/dysplasia were studied. All subjects were eventually tube fed for a mean time of 18. 6 +/- 4.5 months. There was no significant change in height SDS (-0. 9 to -1.1) or weight SDS (-0.4 to -0.2). CONCLUSION: Optimizing nutritional intake by tube feeding children with advanced chronic renal failure from an early age resulted in no decline in growth rate; however, catch-up growth was not achieved.

AB  - Glycosylated forms of pyridoxine, vitamin D, niacin, pantothenate, and riboflavin exist in nature, whereas glycosides of retinol and ascorbic acid are products of in vitro transglycosidation. Beta-Glucosides of pyridoxine (a) are prevalent in plant-derived foods, (b) contribute to human nutrition as partially available sources of vitamin B6, (c) undergo partial hydrolysis by a novel mammalian cytosolic beta-glucosidase, and (d) exert a weak antagonistic effect on the utilization of free pyridoxine. Niacin exists in grains as complexed forms with low bioavailability, whereas vitamin D glycosides are toxic components of certain calcinogenic plants of importance in animal health. Glycosides of pantothenate and riboflavin appear to be minor products of mammalian metabolism. Glycosylation of retinol or other hydrophobic alcohols may facilitate glycolipid turnover, whereas a stable ascorbyl glucoside may have nutritional applications. Glycosylation of vitamins exerts widely ranging chemical and biological effects, with great nutritional and metabolic significance.

TI  - Nutrition and education: a randomized trial of the effects of breakfast in rural primary school children.  
AB  - Hunger during school may prevent children in developing countries from benefiting from education. Although many countries have implemented school feeding programs, few programs have been rigorously evaluated. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of giving breakfast to undernourished and adequately nourished children. The undernourished group comprised 407 children in grades 2-5 in 16 rural Jamaican schools (weights-for-age < or = -1 SD of the National Center for Health Statistics references) and the adequately nourished group comprised 407 children matched for school and class (weights-for-age >-1 SD). Both groups were stratified by class and school, then randomly assigned to breakfast or control groups. After the initial measurements, breakfast was provided every school day for 1 school year. Children in the control group were given one-quarter of an orange and the same amount of attention as children in the breakfast group. All children had their heights and weights measured and were given the Wide Range Achievement Test before and after the intervention. School attendance was taken from the schools' registers. Compared with the control group, height, weight, and attendance improved significantly in the breakfast group. Both groups made poor progress in Wide Range Achievement Test scores. Younger children in the breakfast group improved in arithmetic. There was no effect of nutritional group on the response to breakfast.
