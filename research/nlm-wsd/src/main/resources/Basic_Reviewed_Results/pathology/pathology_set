TI  - Neuropathology of myelitis, myelopathy, and spinal infections in AIDS.  
AB  - In AIDS, pathology in the spinal contents usually follows that in the brain but is less frequent. Opportunistic infections are found in an average of 9.5% of spinal AIDS autopsies but in 54% of autopsies of the whole CNS. Necrotizing CMV radiculomyelitis is a rare (3.4% in spinal autopsies) but very characteristic opportunistic spinal lesion. The most prominent spinal cord disease in AIDS is vacuolar myelopathy, occurring in greatly differing frequencies according to different geographical areas, with a mean of about 22.5% in AIDS spinal cord autopsies. Its pathogenesis and clinicopathologic correlation need clarification; it appears to develop mainly in severely ill AIDS patients with significant viral load, advanced immunosuppression, and confounding metabolic imbalance.

TI  - [The relationship of vascular changes and immune status disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1]  
AB  - Immunologic status was studied in 86 patients with type-I diabetes mellitus before and after treatment with decarise, thymaline and T-activin. With the aid of ECG, phonocardiogramme, apex cardiogramme, oscillogramme, there has been calculated index of vitality of the myocardium reflecting the subendocardial bloodflow. The principal parameters characterising bodily immune status (absolute number of T- and B-lymphocytes), T-suppressors counts as well as those of circulating immune complexes (CIC) were compared to the values for subendocardial bloodflow (end-diastolic pressure, index of vitality of the myocardium). There has been established strong inverse relation between the absolute numbers of T-, B-lymphocytes, and CIC, end-diastolic pressure and index of vitality of the myocardium, this being regarded as evidence in confirmation of the guarding role of the former and damaging one of the latter (CIC) under vascular pathology in diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Role of passenger leukocytes in allograft rejection: effect of depletion of donor alveolar macrophages on the local production of TNF-alpha, T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokines, IgG subclasses, and pathology in a rat model of lung transplantation.  
AB  - Acute lung allograft rejection is believed to be initiated by passenger leukocytes, such as alveolar macrophages (AM), in the donor organ, which release TNF-alpha, and present alloantigens to host lymphocytes, to up-regulated Th1 cellular and humoral immunity. However, the role of donor AM in local TNF-alpha synthesis, and their ability to induce local Th1 cellular and humoral immunity have not been evaluated. By depleting Brown Norway (BN, RT1n) rat lung allografts of AM before transplantation into Lewis rat (LEW, RT1(1)) recipients, the current study determined the role of donor AM in including the production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokine), IL-4 (Th2 cytokine), IgG subtypes, and rejection pathology in the allograft. The data show that compared with untreated BN allografts, pretransplant depletion of donor lung AM resulted in significantly less TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma production in allograft bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with variable effects on local IL-4 production. Depletion of AM in the donor lung before transplantation affected the local production of several IgG subclasses. However, pretransplant depletion of donor AM had no effect on the development of the pathology of severe acute rejection. These data show that donor AM have a central role in the local synthesis of TNF-alpha and induce the production of IFN-gamma and IgG subtypes, locally, during acute lung allograft rejection. However, depletion of AM before transplantation does not prevent the development of severe acute rejection in BN rat lungs, transplanted into LEW recipients.

TI  - Embryonic stem cell lines from MRL mice allow genetic modification in a murine model of autoimmune disease.  
AB  - The MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL-lpr/lpr) mouse spontaneously develops a generalized autoimmune disease with features similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus. This mouse strain provides a valuable system for identifying and characterizing the multiple genetic factors that influence the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. One of the most powerful means of examining the role of a specific gene product in vivo is by inactivating the gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination and using these cells to derive mouse lines carrying the inactivated gene. The successful application of this approach, however, requires an ES cell line that will remain stable in culture during the processes of genetic manipulation and selection. To date, ES cell lines that meet this criterion have been derived from only a few mouse strains. Here we describe the production and characterization of stable ES cell lines from the MRL mouse strain. Approximately 7% of the blastocysts derived from the MRL/MpJ+ (MRL-+/+) strain gave rise to ES cell lines, and both of the male MRL-+/+ ES cell lines tested were shown to be germline competent. We show that the MRL-+/+ ES cell lines undergo gene targeting by homologous recombination at high frequency by inactivating the gene encoding the EP2 prostaglandin receptor. These Ep2-targeted MRL ES cell lines were used to generate MRL mouse lines heterozygous for the disrupted Ep2 gene, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using a genetic approach to dissect the pathobiology of the autoimmune disease in the MRL mouse.

TI  - PET scanning and the human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient.  
AB  - The use of PET scanning in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and fever of unknown origin, confusion and/or weight loss was investigated. METHODS: Eighty patients were examined using PET. Fifty-seven patients had half-body scans with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and 23 patients had brain studies performed with FDG. Fourteen patients also had [11C]methionine studies (2 chest, 1 abdomen and 11 brain) performed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with lymphoma had the extent of the disease clearly identified in both nodal and extranodal sites. Patients with a variety of infections (Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare) had disease localized for appropriate biopsy or sampling procedures. A half-body FDG-PET scan had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 94% for localization of focal pathology that needed treatment. High uptake of FDG (greater than liver) had a positive predictive value for pathology needing treatment of 95%. FDG brain studies showed that 16 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells/ml had reduced cortical uptake compared with that in basal ganglia. FDG scans were abnormal in all 19 patients with focal space occupying lesions identified by magnetic resonance scans. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) over cerebral lesions due to toxoplasma were in the range of 0.14-3.7 (13 patients) and due to lymphoma were in the range of 3.9-8.7 (6 patients). Three more patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy had SUVs in the range of 1.0-1.5 over the lesions. Another patient had a low-grade oligodendroglioma (SUV = 2.9). Carbon-11-methionine uptake also was high in patients with cerebral lymphoma but did not add to the discrimination between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma in these patients obtained with the FDG scan. CONCLUSION: In hospitals with access to PET facilities, FDG scanning allows the rapid evaluation of the whole body, including the brain, of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, with a report potentially available within 4 hr of injection. Sites of infection and tumor were identified, and discrimination between cerebral pathologies was possible.

TI  - In situ hybridization and its diagnostic applications in pathology.  
AB  - In situ hybridization (ISH) is a technique by which specific nucleotide sequences are identified in cells or tissue sections. These may be endogenous, bacterial or viral, DNA or RNA. On the basis of research applications, the technique is now being translated into diagnostic practice, mainly in the areas of gene expression, infection and interphase cytogenetics. Diagnostic applications are most often based on short nucleotide sequences (oligomers) labelled with non-isotopic reporter molecules, and sites of binding may be localized by histochemical or immunohistochemical methods. The technique can be applied to routinely fixed and processed tissues; with some targets, it is even possible to obtain hybridization in autopsy material. ISH has been used to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) as a marker of gene expression, where levels of protein storage are low; for example, to confirm an endocrine tumour as the source of excess hormone production. Its application in infectious diseases has to date been mainly in viral infections, such as the typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) or the detection of Epstein-Barr virus by the presence of small nuclear RNAs (EBERs). The expression of mRNAs for histone proteins has been used to detect cells in S phase, and related methods may be applied to detect apoptotic cells. Using probes to chromosome-specific sequences, it is possible to detect aneuploidy, and to document changes in specific chromosomes, which may have prognostic significance in some tumours, such as B-cell chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Using sequence-specific probes, translocations can be identified, such as the t(11;12) of Ewing's sarcoma. This review presents an outline of the technique of in situ hybridization and discusses areas of current and potential diagnostic application.

TI  - Amyloidogenic role of cytokine TGF-beta1 in transgenic mice and in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - Deposition of amyoid-beta peptide in the central nervous system is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and a possible cause of neurodegeneration. The factors that initiate or promote deposition of amyloid-beta peptide are not known. The transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 plays a central role in the response of the brain to injury, and increased TGF-beta1 has been found in the central nervous system of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that TGF-beta1 induces amyloid-beta deposition in cerebral blood vessels and meninges of aged transgenic mice overexpressing this cytokine from astrocytes. Co-expression of TGF-beta1 in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid-precursor protein, which develop Alzheimer's like pathology, accelerated the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide. More TGF-beta1 messenger RNA was present in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients than in controls, the levels correlating strongly with amyloid-beta deposition in the damaged cerebral blood vessels of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These results indicate that overexpression of TGF-beta1 may initiate or promote amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models and so may be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - [Predisposition to thyroid autoimmune diseases]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Genetic predisposition is required for the expression of thyroid autoimmune disorder addition to the immune dysfunction and the environmental factors. METHODS: In order to evaluate the role of this genetic factor, we reported the results of immunological and hormonal investigations of 62 members (TD), belonging to a large Akr family, who are related to 40 patients with Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. RESULTS: The hormonal analyses showed that 19 subjects exhibited an infraclinical hypothyroidism, subdivided into 7 members with pathological rates of TSH evocative of thyroid insufficiency and 12 others with compensative thyroid insufficiency. Seventeen subjects of the Akr family who had solely antithyroid autoantibodies were considered as potential candidates to develop thyroid autoimmune diseases. The clinical follow-up, during two years, confirmed the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 3 members among 19 subjects with infraclinical hypothyroidism (TD05, TD28 and TD54) and in only 1 member out of the 17 potential candidates (TD03). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that a serological study of hormones and/or autoantibodies directed against thyroid antigens, could allow the detection of predisposed subjects to develop a thyroid autoimmune pathology. The Akr family seems to be suitable for the study of the localization of susceptibility genes to TAID.

TI  - Classification of Sneddon's syndrome.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of generalized broken ("racemose") livedo and cerebrovascular accidents is referred to as "Sneddon's syndrome". Although several pathogenetic factors have been suggested the aetiology of Sneddon's syndrome is unknown. Furthermore, considerable variability of patient characteristics gives rise to the question whether "Sneddon's syndrome" denotes a homogeneous disease entity at all. We hypothesized that the diagnosis "Sneddon's syndrome" can be broken down into different subgroups according to possible aetiologic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with the combination of generalized broken livedo and cerebrovascular accidents were evaluated by clinical examination, routine diagnostic procedures, MRI of the brain, echocardiography, vascular ultrasound, immunologic and haemostaseologic testing. Patient groups were formed, depending on (1) whether or not an additional feature with a possibly aetiologic role for Sneddon's syndrome was present, and (2) which kind of feature it was. RESULTS: In 16 out of 32 patients, diagnostic features with an implication for the pathogenesis of Sneddon's syndrome could be identified. An autoimmune disorder was diagnosed in six patients. A thrombophilic state was detected in six patients. Three patients had preexisting atherosclerosis. One patient suffered from an embolizing atrial myxoma. Extent and kind of cerebral pathology differed between patient groups as did the kind of cardiac involvement. CONCLUSION: Sneddon's syndrome is not a homogeneous disease entity. Patients should be classified as "primary Sneddon's syndrome" if no aetiologic factor can be detected. On clinical grounds, this from differs from several varieties of "secondary Sneddon's syndrome" which occurs mainly as part of an autoimmune disorder or in a thrombophilic state.

TI  - Effect of enzyme replacement therapy on bone formation in a feline model of mucopolysaccharidosis type VI.  
AB  - A range of skeletal abnormalities are evident in mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) including short stature and dysostosis multiplex, resulting from a deficiency in the lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulphatase (4S). In this article, bone pathology was assessed in a feline model of MPS VI to evaluate the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) as a treatment modality for this genetic disorder. Osteopenia is clearly evident in MPS VI animals, with bone mineral volume (BV/TV) falling well below that of normal animals (4.39% vs. 20.11%, respectively). Trabecular bone architecture was also affected in MPS VI with fewer, thinner, and more widely spaced trabeculae apparent. Bone formation rate (BFR/BS) was also lower in MPS VI animals than controls (0.0011 mm3/mm2 per day vs. 0.008 mm3/mm2 per day, respectively). Vertebral and tibial bone length in MPS VI animals progressively fell behind normal values with increasing age, as did cortical bone thickness. Vertebral body shape was also altered. ERT with recombinant human 4S (rh4S) resulted in a vertebral BV/TV of 8.23% in animals treated with an intravenous enzyme dose of 1 mg/kg and a BV/TV of 14.33% in animals treated with a dose of 5 mg/kg. BFR/BS also increased to 0.0034 mm3/mm2 per day in animals treated with enzyme doses of either 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg rh4S. All other affected histomorphometric parameters also improved with ERT to a level intermediate between MPS VI untreated animals and normals. However, individual animals treated with 0.2 mg/kg rh4S intravenously or 1.0 mg/kg rh4S administered subcutaneously did not exhibit an improvement over untreated MPS VI animals. Vertebral and tibial bone lengths, tibial cortical bone thickness, and vertebral body shape also responded to ERT, with a trend away from the untreated group. Thus, ERT had a positive effect on bone development in MPS VI animals that was dependent upon the dose of enzyme administered and the route of administration.

TI  - [Antibiotic policy in intensive care]  
AB  - The use of antibiotics takes places by following a series of norms, which are called the antibiotics policy. The importance of their correct use is based on the influence which the antimicrobial agents may have on the development of resistance by the endogenous agents in a specific hospital or department, and on the other hand, by their capacity to predispose patients for colonization with resistant flora. This is specially important in critical patients who are hospitalized in the Intensive Medicine Department, where the use of antibiotics affects more than 50% of those admitted, and where the appearance of multiresistant pathogens is frequent. The choice of the antibiotics which are used for the empirical and/or focused treatment of the majority of infections, is the basis of the antibiotics policy. It is based on the knowledge of the there essential pillars of the problem: the pathogenic agents which are predominant in each area, the patients' characteristics which favor the appearance of specific micro-organisms, and the antibiotics which can be used for their treatment. In the hospital, the establishment diffusion, and enforcement of these rules, is conducted by a multi-disciplinary committee, in which an intensive care physician specialized in infectious pathology participates, in close collaboration with other specialists (microbiology, pharmacy, infectious diseases), all of whom are committed to the control and correct use of antibiotics.

TI  - Adult groin hernias: new insight into their biomechanical characteristics.  
AB  - The biomechanical properties of the transversalis fascia and rectus abdominis aponeurosis were assessed in adult groin hernias, using a computerized-suction device (Cutometer) equipped with a 2-mm probe. Evaluations were made ex vivo on fresh samples collected from 63 patients with unilateral or bilateral hernias and 30 control subjects without hernias. Under 50 and 200 mbar suctions, there was no statistical difference between the overall mechanical properties of control and patient aponeuroses. For both 50 and 200 mbar suctions, the maximum distension (MD) and the biological elasticity (BE) of fasciae from direct hernias were significantly increased, compared with control fasciae. In the same comparison, the MD-50 and -200 and the BE-50 of patient fasciae from the non-herniated sides were also significantly increased. It is concluded that the presently reported biomechanical alterations seem to be the cause and not the consequence of the hernias. These data suggest that a functional connective tissue pathology probably plays a role in the genesis of groin hernias.

TI  - HLA-DQ alleles associate with cutaneous features of onchocerciasis. The Kaduna-London-Manchester Collaboration for Research on Onchocerciasis.  
AB  - Onchocerciasis is associated with a spectrum of cutaneous changes, ranging from clinically normal skin to acute and chronic pathology. An important aspect of disease expression may be the level of immune response to parasite antigens, which is likely to be regulated by MHC-encoded molecules. We therefore investigated HLA class I and class II phenotypes in Nigerian residents of an area endemic for onchocerciasis. All study subjects were carefully characterized for parasite load and skin pathology. Individuals with depigmentation had increased frequencies of DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0301 compared with persons with normal skin and high microfilarial load (NSHMF) (Odds Ratios 3.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 13.2) and 3.8 (1.0 to 15.2), respectively). Conversely, individuals with depigmentation had a decreased frequency of DQA1*0101 and Cw6 compared with NSHMF (Odds Ratios 0.2 (0.1 to 0.9) and 0.1 (0.02 to 0.8), respectively). When NSHMF subjects were examined by age, a further decrease in DQA1*0501 frequency and increase in DQA1*0101 frequency were observed in older NSHMF individuals. These results strongly suggest that there is an immunogenetic basis for the spectrum of cutaneous presentations in onchocerciasis and that HLA-DQ molecules are associated with the level of immune response to parasite antigens.

TI  - Clinically suspected primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction: clinicopathologic review of 150 patients.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of lacrimal sac pathology in patients with clinically suspected primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction is unknown. This is an important issue when considering the potential risk of either conservative nonsurgical management or laser dacryocystorhinostomy, neither of which permits direct visualization and biopsy of the lacrimal outflow apparatus. METHODS: A total of 162 lacrimal sac biopsy specimens were obtained in 150 consecutive patients undergoing external or endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy for clinical primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction from January 1992 to October 1994. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients (98%) had histopathologic findings consistent with inflammation or fibrosis of the lacrimal sac or both. In the remaining three patients, abnormalities included sarcoid granuloma (one patient), oncocytoma (one patient), and lymphoma (one patient). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of significant pathology of the lacrimal sac in clinically suspected primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction is low. However, these cases can be identified correctly only by routine biopsy of the lacrimal sac during dacryocystorhinostomy.

METHODS: For the 36 patients, medical records were reviewed throughout the 5-yr study period. These records included pathology reports, results from 60-cm sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy examinations, and notations from visits to health facilities for reasons other than colorectal examinations. RESULTS: Seventy-one clinically significant lesions were removed during the 5-yr period; 58 were discovered by sigmoidoscopy and 13 by colonoscopy. Also, during the 5-yr period, noncolorectal cancer was diagnosed in six patients, and two patients died of cardiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have clinically significant colorectal pathology found by 60-cm sigmoidoscope have a high prevalence of lesions beyond the view of this instrument. Therefore, colonoscopy should be performed when sigmoidoscopy shows clinically significant pathology. Because subsequent examinations show a high incidence of new lesions, rescreening is indicated.

AB  - 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown to induce parkinsonism both in man and non-human primates. Several models have now been developed, but acute MPTP administration does not consistently reproduce all the clinical features of the disease. To mirror the slow evolution observed in human pathology, a chronic model of intoxication is necessary. The present study describes a chronic MPTP protocol in the monkey. Six monkeys received daily injections of MPTP (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) until they reached a score over 8 on the clinical rating scale (15.5 days +/- 1.1). Full parkinsonism was first obtained on the 22nd day. Levodopa testing (20 mg/kg per os) alleviated motor abnormalities (51%), proving the parkinsonian nature of these disturbances. Histological lesions reproduced those observed in Parkinson's disease with a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity of 90%. This model so could be of great interest for the study of the dynamic physiopathological changes which occur in Parkinson's disease and consequently for research on new neuroprotective therapies.

TI  - Sentinel lymphadenectomy for breast cancer in a community managed care setting.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and reproducibility of intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy (IOLM/SL) in the staging of breast cancer patients in a community managed care setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients with primary breast cancer were prospectively studied over a 26-month period. They underwent vital dye injection at their primary breast cancer site. Lymphatic channels were traced to the sentinel lymph node, which was excised, serially sectioned, and examined. A level I and II axillary lymph node dissection and definitive breast surgery were then performed. RESULTS: Sentinel nodes were identified in 103 of 145 procedures (71.0%). Sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes were concordant in 100 of 103 cases (97.1%). Three patients (9.7%) had falsely negative sentinel nodes; there were none in the last 80 patients. Of 28 positive sentinel nodes, 12 (42.9%) represented the only tumor-containing node within the axilla. Sentinel nodes were significantly more likely to contain tumor than nonsentinel nodes (33/50, 66.0% vs 54/467, 11.6%, P < 0.0001). IOLM/SL identified more micrometastases (< 2 mm) than standard axillary lymph node dissection (13/33, 39.6% vs 4/177, 2.2%, P < 0.001). Nine of 42 patients (21.4%) whose sentinel node could not be identified had five or more nodal metastases. Two of six patients with presumed Tis primaries had nodal metastases. DISCUSSION: IOLM/SL accurately identifies the sentinel lymph node(s) most likely to contain metastatic disease. A procedural learning curve was present. An unsuccessful IOLM/SL was a risk factor for considerable nodal metastases. IOLM/SL with a tumor-free sentinel node may obviate a formal axillary lymph node dissection. The technique was feasible, economical, and reproducible within the context of a community managed care facility, while not placing exacting demands on operating room, pathology, or nuclear medicine personnel.

TI  - Two amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer disease-like pathology.  
AB  - Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene cause early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD) by affecting the formation of the amyloid beta (A beta) peptide, the major constituent of AD plaques. We expressed human APP751 containing these mutations in the brains of transgenic mice. Two transgenic mouse lines develop pathological features reminiscent of AD. The degree of pathology depends on expression levels and specific mutations. A 2-fold overexpression of human APP with the Swedish double mutation at positions 670/671 combined with the V717I mutation causes A beta deposition in neocortex and hippocampus of 18-month-old transgenic mice. The deposits are mostly of the diffuse type; however, some congophilic plaques can be detected. In mice with 7-fold overexpression of human APP harboring the Swedish mutation alone, typical plaques appear at 6 months, which increase with age and are Congo Red-positive at first detection. These congophilic plaques are accompanied by neuritic changes and dystrophic cholinergic fibers. Furthermore, inflammatory processes indicated by a massive glial reaction are apparent. Most notably, plaques are immunoreactive for hyperphosphorylated tau, reminiscent of early tau pathology. The immunoreactivity is exclusively found in congophilic senile plaques of both lines. In the higher expressing line, elevated tau phosphorylation can be demonstrated biochemically in 6-month-old animals and increases with age. These mice resemble major features of AD pathology and suggest a central role of A beta in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  - Periodontal conditions in 35-44-yr-old adults in France, 1993.  
AB  - A national study was carried out in France in 1993 to assess the periodontal status of the population aged 35-44 yr. The study took part in the Second International Collaborative Study of Oral Health Outcomes developed and coordinated by the World Health Organization. The representative sample was composed of 1000 subjects. The Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) index was used. Gingivitis prevalence was high (80.4%) while 26.6% of dentate subjects had shallow pockets (4-5 mm). Deep pockets (> 6 mm) were rare (1.6%) concerning on average 0.1 sextant per subject; 87.5% of the 994 dentate adults needed periodontal treatment. Oral health education and scaling should reduce periodontal pathology in this population group.

TI  - Gradient-echo perfusion imaging of musculoskeletal abnormalities with contrast-enhanced two-dimensional fat-saturation FLASH.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of MR perfusion imaging of various musculoskeletal lesions with a contrast-enhanced two-dimensional fat saturation fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence and to assess the potential of this technique for distinguishing malignant from benign conditions. Thirty-six musculoskeletal lesions were studied at 1.5 T. The signal intensity of the lesions, adjacent artery, muscle, bone marrow, and fat were plotted against time. The time to peak enhancement, time to maximum signal intensity, percent enhancement, rate of peak enhancement, and rate of enhancement parameters were calculated. Because of a significant overlap between malignant and benign conditions, accuracy rates were lower than reported previously. The best parameter based on these values was the rate of peak enhancement (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 65.2-66.6%; positive predictive value, 57.8-68.7%). Fat saturation gradient-echo MR perfusion imaging allows for a rapid assessment of the vascularity of musculoskeletal pathology; however, a significant overlap persists between malignant neoplasms and several benign conditions.

AB  - Immunohistochemical stain was used to observe the pathology of endothelium, extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) in gastric coronary vein of 30 cirrhotic patients and 10 controls. There was widespread destruction to endothelium, intravenous thrombosis, aggregation of pericyte, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and increased FN, LN, collagen IV and smooth muscle actin in the wall of the coronary vein in cirrhotic patients. The thickness of the wall and its smooth muscle were 3.07 +/- 1.03 mm and 2.31 +/- 0.76 mm respectively in cirrhotic patients, and 1.65 +/- 0.49 mm and 0.88 +/- 0.20 mm in non-cirrhotic patients (P < 0.01). Based on these observations a new concept of portal hypertensive vasculopathy was put forward.

TI  - Accelerated Alzheimer-type phenotype in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 transgenes.  
AB  - Genetic causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes. The mutant APP(K670N,M671L) transgenic line, Tg2576, shows markedly elevated amyloid beta-protein (A beta) levels at an early age and, by 9-12 months, develops extracellular AD-type A beta deposits in the cortex and hippocampus. Mutant PS1 transgenic mice do not show abnormal pathology, but do display subtly elevated levels of the highly amyloidogenic 42- or 43-amino acid peptide A beta42(43). Here we demonstrate that the doubly transgenic progeny from a cross between line Tg2576 and a mutant PS1M146L transgenic line develop large numbers of fibrillar A beta deposits in cerebral cortex and hippocampus far earlier than their singly transgenic Tg2576 littermates. In the period preceding overt A beta deposition, the doubly transgenic mice show a selective 41% increase in A beta42(43) in their brains. Thus, the development of AD-like pathology is substantially enhanced when a PS1 mutation, which causes a modest increase in A beta42(43), is introduced into Tg2576-derived mice. Remarkably, both doubly and singly transgenic mice showed reduced spontaneous alternation performance in a "Y" maze before substantial A beta deposition was apparent. This suggests that some aspects of the behavioral phenotype in these mice may be related to an event that precedes plaque formation.

PMID- 9396180
TI  - The role of nitric oxide in portal hypertensive systemic and portal vascular pathology.  
AB  - Hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance and reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictor are features of hyperdynamic syndrome in portal hypertension (PH) and are pathogenetic factors triggering most serious clinical complications of liver cirrhosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful vasodilating agent, released from vascular endothelium cell and effecting relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. An increased release of NO has been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of vasodilation and vascular hypocontractility associated with PH. In agreement with this hypothesis, the whole-body production of NO has been found to be increased in PH, and the measurement of NOS mRNA expression in different organs suggest that the splanchnic vascular system is a major source of NO release. Consequently, NO could play a role in the development of the splanchnic hyperaemia, collateral circulation and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Furthermore, increased generation of NO in central circulation likely accounts for pulmonary vasorelaxation and cardiac dysfunction found in cirrhosis. By contrast, PH-associated endothelial dysfunction seems to invalidate the capability of intrahepatic and intrarenal vasculature to produce NO. A deficient NO release in these vascular territories might contribute to enhancement of PH and development of the hepatorenal syndrome. Overall NO hyperproduction is either the cause (induction of iNOS) or the consequence (stimulation of ecNOS) of the hyperdynamic syndrome. This incertitude results from the yet undefined significance of mild and transitory activation of the endotoxin-cytokines axis for iNOS induction and contradictory data on specific iNOS and ecNOS activities. A contribution of each isoform of NOS to pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic syndrome probably depends on the model of PH in animal studies and the aetiology or severity of cirrhosis in human studies.

TI  - The 'watering-can' perineum: presentation and management.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of 'watering-can' perineum among patients with post-inflammatory urethral strictures, to evaluate methods of anatomical location and to assess the efficacy of direct-vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) in this condition. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1990 to 1996, 216 patients with post-inflammatory urethral strictures were evaluated; all underwent ascending urethrography and urethroscopy and 44 were found to have a 'watering-can' perineum. These patients were evaluated further for the presence of associated urethral pathology. e.g. calculi and diverticulae. DVIU was performed as the primary method of treatment and any associated urethral pathology treated at the same time. The follow-up ranged from 3 to 36 months (mean 20). RESULTS: Ascending urethrography and urethroscopy located the site of the stricture in all 44 patients: 12 had associated urethral calculi. In 28 patients, the fistulae healed completely after a single DVIU, a further 11 required two urethrotomies, while the remaining five required more than two urethrotomies to treat the stricture. CONCLUSION: DVIU can be used to treat strictures complicated by urethrocutaneous fistulae, and for detecting associated urethral pathology. It has the advantage of requiring a minimal hospital stay, provoking minimal morbidity and the procedure can be repeated as a day-case if the stricture recurs.

These findings suggest that some forms of psychosis are a manifestation of pathophysiological changes in the brainstem. Some implications of this hypothesis for the treatment of psychoses are discussed.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of acute axonal pathology in experimental spinal cord contusion.  
AB  - The major sensorimotor deficits that result from traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) are due to loss of axons in ascending and descending pathways of the white matter (WM). Experimental treatments administered after a standardized SCI can reduce WM loss and long-term functional deficits. Thus, a significant proportion of WM loss occurs secondary to the mechanical injury and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Presently, we know little of how and when secondary injury mechanisms operate in the WM after SCI. We therefore used a standardized rat model of clinically relevant contusion injury to examine axonal pathology over the first 24 h by light and electron microscopy. Based on qualitative evaluation of tissue at 15 min, 4 h, and 24 h after a "mild" SCI produced with a weight-drop device (10 g x 2.5 cm), we selected areas from the ventromedial WM at the lesion epicenter for quantitative analyses. We compared axon number and the proportion of axons with various axoplasmic and myelin abnormalities over time after SCI, as well as the effect of axon size on degree of pathology and loss. We found by 4 h postinjury (pi) axonal pathology was more severe than at 15 min and that a significant loss of large diameter axons had occurred; no significant additional loss of axons was seen by 24 h pi. When we compared axonal pathology after a more severe contusion (10 g x 17.5 cm), we found a greater loss of axons at 4 h. In addition, a higher proportion of the remaining axons demonstrated pathological alterations. We developed a semi-quantitative Axonal Injury Index (AII) as an overall measure of axonal pathology that was sensitive to the effects of injury severity at 4 h pi. The AII has greater statistical power than our individual measures of axonal pathology. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use the AII at 4 h pi to assess effects of potential therapeutic agents on acute axonal pathology after SCI.

TI  - Virulence of Streptococcus suis type 2 for mice and pigs appeared host-specific.  
AB  - A murine model for Streptococcus suis infection in pigs was validated by inoculating groups of 5 BALB/c and 5 CF1 mice with 10(7) CFU/ml of 13 different S. suis serotype 2 strains. The pathogenicity of these strains had been established in a standardized pig model of S. suis infection using one-week-old gnotobiotic pigs. We inoculated groups of mice intraperitoneally with 4 strains that were highly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, with 4 strains, that were weakly virulent for pigs and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, and with 5 strains that were non-virulent for pigs and belonged to phenotype MRP-EF-. The S. suis strains that were highly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity and an intermediate mortality in mice, the S. suis strains that were weakly virulent for pigs caused high morbidity but low mortality, and the strains that were non-virulent for pigs, induced highest morbidity and mortality. These results were comparable in both breeds of mice. In contrast to the pathology of S. suis infection in pigs with specific lesions, lesions in mice were histologically often characterized as non-specific, i.e., necrotizing encephalitis and focal or diffuse hepatitis sometimes with abscesses. Irrespective of breed (BALB/c vs. CF1), the murine model used for S. suis infection was incompatible with the pig model. This indicates that virulence of S. suis type 2 for mice and pigs is host-specific. Therefore, we regard the presently available murine models unsuitable for studying S. suis infections in pigs.

TI  - Glycosaminoglycan components in temporomandibular joint synovial fluid as markers of joint pathology.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the correlation between temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease and the composition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) components in the synovial fluid (SF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) was obtained from 30 TMJs of 28 female patients diagnosed as having a displaced disc with reduction (WR) (seven joints), a displaced disc without reduction (WOR) (13 joints), osteoarthritis (OA) (five joints), or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (five joints) by MR imaging and clinical examination. After the SF was directly aspirated, It was digested with chondroitinase ABC and hyaluronidase, and the concentration of unsaturated disaccharide isomers of chondroitin 6-sulfate (delta di-6S), chondroitin 4-sulfate (delta di-4S) and hyaluronic acid (delta di-HA) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with fluorometry. The ratio of delta di-6S or delta di-4S to delta di-HA, and delta di-6S to delta di-4S, were calculated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in concentrations of delta di-6S, delta di-4S, or delta di-HA among the groups. The ratio of delta di-6S to delta di-4S was 2.7 +/- 1.4 in OA, 2.6 +/- 0.9 in joints with WOR, 2.9 +/- 1.2 in joints with WR, and 1.3 +/- 0.4 in RA synovial fluid. Differences in the delta di-6S: delta di-4S ratio between RA and the other conditions were statistically significant (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the delta di-6S:delta di-4S ratio in the synovial fluid of the TMJ reflects the proteoglycan metabolism of the joint tissues, particularly of the articular cartilage and synovial tissue. This ratio could be used to diagnose joint diseases and to predict articular cartilage destruction or synovial proliferation caused by these diseases.

TI  -  Pathology of explanted cryopreserved allograft heart valves: comparison with aortic valves from orthotopic heart transplants [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the morphology, mechanisms of deterioration, cellular viability, extracellular matrix integrity, and the role of immune responses in the dysfunction of cryopreserved aortic and pulmonic valve allografts. METHODS: We studied 33 explanted left-sided (n = 20) or right-sided (n = 13) cryopreserved human allograft heart valves explanted several hours to 9 years after operation, 14 nonimplanted allografts, and 16 aortic valves removed from transplanted allograft hearts 2 days to 4 years after operation. Analysis included gross inspection, radiography, light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Allografts implanted for more than 1 day had progressive collagen hyalinization and loss of normal structural complexity and cellularity, including endothelium and deep connective tissue cells. Inflammatory cells were generally minimal or absent in the allografts. Transmission electron microscopy of long-term cryopreserved allograft valves revealed no viable cells, focal calcification centered around dead cell remnants, and distorted but preserved collagen. In contrast, aortic valves from transplanted hearts showed remarkable structural preservation, including endothelium and abundant deep connective tissue cells; inflammatory infiltrates were generally mild and of no apparent deleterious consequence, including valves from patients who died of fatal rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreserved allografts are morphologically nonviable; their collagen is flattened but largely preserved. They are unlikely to grow, remodel, or exhibit active metabolic functions, and their usual degeneration cannot be attributed to immunologic responses. In contrast, aortic valves of transplanted hearts maintain near-normal overall architecture and cellularity and do not show apparent immunologic injury, even in the setting of fatal myocardial parenchymal rejection or graft arteriosclerosis.

TI  - [The use of mesh in abdominal wall defects]  
AB  - Today abdominal wall defect repair can't prescind from the use of prosthetic materials. Inguinal, femoral and incisional hernias represent more frequent events in which, only using prosthetic materials is it possible to perform "tension-free" repair. Prosthetic repairs "agree with" abdominal, wall physio-pathology, guarantee results and prevent recurrences. Permanent biomaterials like polypropylene and dacron mesh deserve special attention for their distinctive features are suitable for abdominal wall defect repair. Selection of material is an important step according to surgical technique and to avoid complications; the most alarming of which is a possible infection. However the average incidence of infection on prosthesis is about 0.5%. While infection risk is really scarce, the benefits of prosthetic repairs are clear: the recurrence rate of traditional hernia repairs is about 33% and 0-0.7% in prosthetic repairs. Likewise the recurrence rate for traditional incisional hernia repair is between 14% and 50%, whereas in prosthetic repairs it is 0-4.5%. Therefore it is necessary to use prosthesis for the following two reasons: firstly to avoid tension on the suture line, the prime cause of recurrence, and secondly to increase formation of collagen fibres on the transversalis fascia that appears histologically and biochemically altered. The authors report their experience of 660 prosthetic repairs, 600 for hernia and 60 for incisional hernia, performed, in the period April 1992-December 1994, at the General Surgery Department in San Giovanni Valdarno Hospital. The surgical techniques used were "tension-free" and "sutureless" and the prosthesis laid down always a polypropylene mesh. Complications only occurred in 33 patients, particularly 4 cases of infection (0.6%) however mesh remove was not required. The follow-up until today evidenced only two early recurrences owing to our technical mistakes in the beginning of our experience. For incisional hernia repair we laid down a giant dacron mesh on preperitoneal space. No complications were registered. The average stay in hospital was 5 days and follow-up showed no recurrence. The use of prosthetic materials in abdominal wall defect repair expressed large benefits with evident and clear reduction in recurrence rate. Traditional techniques produce tension on the suture line and high percentage of early and late recurrences since an essential surgical principle is transgressed. In fact traditionally repair has been accomplished by approximation of anatomical structures, that are not normally in apposition and by utilization of defective tissue. Metabolic alteration involving collagen turnover is evident in these patients. The answer to this problem is prosthetic repair. At present there is no ideal prosthesis, however the surgeon can use several suitable synthetic materials. The selection of prosthetic materials is a fundamental step also considering the possible infection; that however develops rarely. In conclusion the authors think that mesh repairs represent an overcoming of traditional surgical techniques in abdominal wall defect repair.

TI  - The importance of ion channels for macrophage and microglial activation in vitro.  
AB  - Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are activated rapidly in response to neuronal injury. In the search for factors which regulate inflammation resulting from pathology in the CNS, it is logical to focus on changes in the local environment which occur following neuronal death. These include transient alterations in transmembrane ion gradients. Electrophysiological studies have provided information on the range of ion channels expressed by macrophages and microglia in vitro. The purpose of this study was to focus on the biology of macrophages and the role ion channels play in determining their activity. We show that potassium channels are unlikely to be involved in the generation of nitric oxide by activated macrophages and microglial cell lines in vitro. Chloride channels are more likely to contribute to this response. Our results question the functional importance of the observed differences between the potassium channel expression in vitro of macrophages and microglia.

TI  - Caffeic acid phenethyl ester to inhibit posterior capsule opacification in rabbits.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) prevents posterior capsule opacification (PCO) by suppressing the transformation of the lens epithelial cells. SETTING: Departments of Ophthalmology, Chemistry, and Pathology, Turgut Ozal Medical Center, University of Inonu, Malatya, Turkey. METHODS: Twenty pigmented island rabbits having phacoemulsification in their right eyes were randomized into two groups. In group 1, 10 micrograms/ml of CAPE was added to the anterior chamber irrigating solution and a 1% solution of CAPE was injected subconjunctivally for 3 weeks postoperatively. The irrigating solution in Group 2 (control) did not include CAPE. The development of PCO was assessed weekly and its density was graded by slitlamp biomicroscopy. Histologic analysis was performed 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: Group 1 had clear capsules or minor PCO. Group 2 developed more severe PCO or complete opacification. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P = .04). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that CAPE is effective in suppressing PCO in pigmented rabbits and may be beneficial in clinical use in humans because it has no documented harmful effects on normal cells.

TI  - Histological studies of gene-ablated mice support important functional roles for natural killer cells in the uterus during pregnancy.  
AB  - Maternal lymphocytes having a large and granulated morphology accumulate at healthy implantation sites in normal mice. Insight into the functions of these cells has come from a previous study of two independent lines of mice deficient in natural killer (NK) cells. In pregnant Tg epsilon 26 mice, vascular pathology was found that led to the major complications of either fetal death or intrauterine growth retardation. In pregnant p56lck null x IL-2R beta null mice, extensive distension of the decidua was observed that separated the placenta from the myometrium and appeared to be interstitial edema. To strengthen assignment of uterine large granulated lymphocytes to the NK cell lineage and to understand which aspects of NK cell biology may be important for a uterine-based, pregnancy-associated subset, mid-gestation implantation sites from a new series of mice having gene deletions which alter NK cells (IL-2R gamma null, Stat4 null, IL-12 p40 null, beta 7 integrin null and Muc-1 null) have been examined histologically. The findings support the assignment of pregnancy-associated large granulated cells of mice to the NK cell lineage and suggest that the primary functions of these tissue-based NK cells are to support normal development of the decidua and/or its vasculature using pathways that involve IL-12 mediated signal transduction.

TI  - Performance status and comorbidity in elderly cancer patients compared with young patients with neoplasia and elderly patients without neoplastic conditions [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly people constitute a heterogeneous group and are at an increased risk for the development of cancer. It is not clear whether comorbid conditions and functional status influence clinical decisions and the pattern of referral in elderly cancer patients. The current study investigated functional status measured by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, comorbid conditions, and medication taken as well as social environment in three series of patients grouped according to age and diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 593 patients were involved: 138 neoplastic patients age > 70 years with breast, colon, or prostate carcinoma, 177 neoplastic patients age < 70 years with the same types of pathology, and 278 elderly patients with nonneoplastic conditions. Patients with neoplastic disease were recruited from cancer centers; patients with nonneoplastic disease were recruited from either geriatric or general medicine departments. Differences in the distribution of variables were analyzed by univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: No significant differences in social environment, marital status, or education were observed. Statistical differences were noted when comparing the distribution of comorbidities, performance status, and medication taken, elderly neoplastic patients presented in poorer condition compared with younger patients but in better condition compared with elderly patients with nonneoplastic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The overall better health of older cancer patients compared with those without cancer needs to be assessed further. It is possible that cancer is more likely to be diagnosed in healthier elderly, or that primary care providers are reluctant to refer for cancer care patients in poor general health. Studies of comorbidity, function, and social resources are necessary to establish the impact of cancer on survival and quality of life of older patients and to determine the social resources necessary for adequate care.

AB  - Paranasal sinus anatomy and variations have gained interest with the introduction of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and the concept of the ostiomeatal complex. Anatomical variations can be divided in structural abnormalities, (increased) pneumatization and supplementary openings. Most anatomical variations are equally found in control and sinusitis patients. The anatomical variations which are most commonly associated with sinus pathology are septal deviations, true conchae bullosae and supplementary maxillary ostia but the latter one only when recycling is present. The knowledge of anatomical variations is most important in the surgical management and specifically in the prevention of complications.

TI  - Fine-needle aspiration of head and neck masses in children.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Head and neck masses in children are common. Suspicious or persistent masses are referred to the otolaryngologist who is faced with the dilemma of deciding which ones require surgical excision. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in adults helps distinguish lesions requiring excision from those that do not. Few reports exist of its use in children PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 1994, 67 FNAs were performed on children, 29 of which (43%) were for head and neck masses. Based on the FNA findings, 16 patients underwent surgery. RESULTS: In 13 patients, the final pathology was consistent with the FNA findings: granulomatous diseases (3), branchial cysts (3), acute/chronic lymphadenitis (3), thyroglossal cyst, hemangioma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Castleman's disease (one each). There was one misdiagnosis, no false positives, and two nondiagnostic specimens. Based on the results of FNA, surgery was not performed in the remaining 10 patients. The cytology was: cervical lymphadenopathy (7), abscess formation (1), lymphangioma (1), and leukemia (1). CONCLUSION: We conclude that FNA in an extremely useful tool in the management of head and neck masses in children. It is very well-tolerated by children, and we did not encounter any complications.

TI  - [Long-term results of the surgical treatment of acute type A thoracic aortic dissection]  
AB  - Out of a population of 110 patients operated as an emergency for acute Stanford type A dissection of the thoracic aorta between 1985 and 1994, there were 84 survivors. Seventy-nine were assessed after a mean follow-up period of 47.3 months. The corrected 1 year, 5 year and 10 year survival rates were 69 +/- 5.1%, 53.1 +/- 6% and 42.1 +/- 7.1% respectively. There were 19 deaths during the study period: in two thirds of cases death was due to cardiovascular complications related to the aortic pathology or hypertension. There were 13 reoperations in 12 patients for complications on the initial site of repair or for progression of the pathological process. The average time to reoperation was 21.5 months with an operative mortality of 3 patients (25%). Predictive factors of reoperation were young age (52 +/- 4.4 years vs 60.1 +/- 1.4 years; p = 0.037), the persistence of a patent false lumen (p = 0.033) and the initial surgical techniques as the incidence of reoperation seemed to be higher after treatment with biological glue alone or resuspension of the aortic valve compared with replacement of the ascending aorta or Bentall's procedure (p = 0.08). The incidence of reoperation also varies with time as it was 1.8 +/- 0.7% at 1 year, 18.5 +/- 6.5% at 5 years and 26% +/- 7.8 at 10 years. In spite of improvements in surgical technique and postoperative care, acute type A dissection of the aorta carries a poor prognosis in both the short and the long-term with a notable number of cardiac or other complications related to repair of the initial aorta. Analysis of these and other reported results suggest that initial surgery should be as complete as possible with extension to the aortic arch when involved: this more aggressive attitude should improve the long-term results by reducing the risk of reoperation responsible for a high mortality rate.

TI  - Atherogenic lipoproteins enhance murine cortical epithelial cell fibronectin protein synthesis and gene expression.  
AB  - Tubulointerstitial changes, characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) and fibrosis, are often associated with primary glomerular injury. Furthermore, these changes may be better prognostic indicators for decline in renal function than the anatomical changes seen within the glomerulus itself. Although hyperlipidemia and the increased renal accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins are commonly seen in both human and experimental models of renal disease, the possible role that atherogenic lipoproteins may play in the cellular and molecular events associated with the development of tubulointerstitial injury remains unclear. Since atherogenic lipoproteins have been shown to be mediators of renal injury, we examined the effects of native LDL and oxidatively-modified LDL (ox-LDL, a more atherogenic form of LDL) on fibronectin protein synthesis and gene expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells (TEC). Human LDL was freshly isolated and ox-LDL prepared by incubation of LDL with 100 microM CuS04. Incubation of TEC with LDL or ox-LDL (25-50 micrograms/ml) for 24 h increased the steady-state mRNA expression of fibronectin by 16-135% over control as measured by Northern blot analysis and the effect was greater with ox-LDL than native LDL. Additional studies were done to examine whether the increased fibronectin message in response to lipoprotein activation was translated into TEC protein synthesis. The activation of TEC by LDL or ox-LDL stimulated the synthesis and secretion of fibronectin (52-150%, over control) as measured by Western blot analysis. The data show that LDL and ox-LDL stimulate TEC fibronectin gene message and protein synthesis supporting a pathobiological role for these atherogenic lipoproteins in tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

TI  -  Pathology correlations with optical biopsy techniques.  
AB  - Traditional surgical pathology predicts the future course of a patient's disease based on subjective comparison of the biopsy with the outcome of similar biopsies that have been seen previously. Optical techniques are being designed to aid the clinician in evaluating the patients' tissue in vivo. These technologies assess the disease process itself, associated structural alterations or do not have a known physical basis. These techniques will have an almost immediate application in directing the location to biopsy. The true optical biopsy where a definitive diagnosis is made by in vivo optical technology is a laudable goal, but only a few such applications are likely to become available in the near future. In addition to these approaches, the movement towards telemedicine is going to increase the demand for this type of technology for remote monitoring at home as well as in hospital settings.

TI  - The extracellular matrix of the human fetal membranes: structure and function.  
AB  - The human fetal membranes are genetically identical to the fetus and form a highly specialized interface between mother and fetus, of considerable significance to the successful maintenance and termination of pregnancy in the higher vertebrates. Additionally, the upright posture of women presents these tissues with a greater mechanical challenge than in other species. The major extracellular matrix components providing tensile strength and elastic recoil are reviewed, as well as the key enzyme, activator/inhibitor system responsible for their remodelling and breakdown. However, this fails to convey the important concept that the matrix components are bound to each other and to the cells involved in their formation and organization. These matrix components are collectively responsible for the biomechanical properties of the tissue, but they must also be considered as dynamic elements of a broader signalling system, which include hormonal autocrine/paracrine systems. A unifying hypothesis is presented, which attempts for the first time to bring these two facets of the matrix together, which permits a potential coordination of local events at the maternal-fetal interface leading to parturition. In order to understand fully both the normal biology and the pathobiology of these tissues, such integration of the cellular and extracellular signalling pathways must be achieved.

TI  - [Proximal femoral fractures in patients over 75 years. Vital and functional prognosis of a cohort of 78 patients followed during 2.5 years]  
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to highlight factors influencing vital and functional prognosis at 2.5 years of elderly people being treated for a proximal femoral fracture. MATERIAL: The study was based on 78 patients more than 75 years old admitted to the orthopedic department for emergency treatment. After post-operative care, patients were transferred to a geriatric readaptation unit. The average patient age at the time of surgery was 85 years. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Survival graphs were established for the entire population as well as for the sub-populations characterized by a studied parameter. Mortality factors were compared via a univariable analysis. A multivariable logistical regression analysis isolated the factors explaining mortality at 12, 18, and 30 months and survival at 30 months, as well as factors explaining functional prognosis at 1 year. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 41 per cent, 48.5 per cent of deaths occur within the first year. Factors which are harmful for vital prognosis are the following: high degree of dependence before the fracture, the existence of a neuropsychiatric pathology, and age factor (more than 85 years). 61.5 per cent of surviving patients were independent for daily activities. 77 per cent of surviving patients lived in their usual place of residence. Factors which were harmful for functional prognosis were the following: type of the fall, symptomatic of an underlying pathological state, and existence of a neuropsychiatric pathology. Nutrition was also a predictive factor concerning the patient's out come. DISCUSSION: The average age of the studied population was higher than in most studies in literature. The treatment is mainly based on hip arthroplasty. The group of patients of over 85 have the highest mortality rate. However, a better survival rate at 18 months has been observed for patients older than 90 years. The delay before surgical care was significantly negative if longer than 6 days. However, a delay of 3 to 6 days was not significantly harmful for survival. Within the studied population, the maximum autonomy gain was observed during the first 6 months. The type of non-accidental fall, symptomatic of an associated pathology, was a factor for functional prognosis which has not been often mentioned. So was the biological deficit of nutrition. Social status acted as an indicator of functional status evolution. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic choices can only be guided by assessments of patients' vital and functional prognosis. A sophisticated or even expensive device should be demanded for patients with favorable prognosis. For patients with precarious functional and vital prognosis, priority should be given to less invasive techniques with immediate walking. The cost of the device should be correlated with patient's functional investment.

In Japan, various kinds of Japanese classification of cancers have widely been accepted since 1962. Researchers may be confounded at international cancer conferences because of some differences in these classification. We here summarize the history and criteria of the present TNM classification and describe the concept of new N factors additional and in the 5th edition. In the Japanese versions of cancer classification, the concepts of H and P factors should be reconsidered. The importance of the cytologic diagnosis in ascites is discussed and pathological grades of differentiation into the new cancer staging are introduced.

TI  - Accurate prediction of histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and the differential diagnosis of dementia: the use of NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-III-R criteria, SPECT, X-ray CT, and APO E4 medial temporal lobe dementias. The Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging [corrected and republished in Int Psychogeriatr 1998 Sep;10(3):271-302]  
AB  - In a prospective study of more than 200 cases of dementia and 119 controls, annual technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propylene amineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and annual medial temporal lobe (MTL) oriented X-ray computed tomography (CT) have been used to evaluate the diagnostic potential of functional and structural neuroimaging in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Some subjects have had up to 7 annual evaluations. So far, of 151 who have died, 143 (95%) have come to necropsy. Histology is known for 118, of whom 80 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), 24 had other "non-AD" dementias, and 14 controls with no cognitive deficit in life also had no significant central nervous system pathology. To compare the findings in the dementias with the profile of structural and functional imaging in the cognitively normal elderly, scan data from 105 living, elderly controls without cognitive deficit have also been included in the analysis. All clinical diagnoses were according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicable Disease and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; DSM-III-R) criteria, and all histopathological diagnoses according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria. Early data from this cohort have suggested that the combination of both MTL atrophy seen on CT with parietotemporal hypoperfusion on SPECT may predict the pathology of AD. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of the NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-III-R criteria could be assessed in this cohort against the gold standard of histopathology. The diagnostic potential of CT evidence of MTL atrophy alone, SPECT evidence of parietotemporal hypoperfusion alone, and the combination of both of these scan changes in the same individual could then be compared against the diagnostic accuracy of clinical operational criteria in the pathologically confirmed cases. Furthermore, all of these modalities could be compared with the diagnostic accuracy of apolipoprotein E4 (Apo E4) genotyping to predict AD in the histopathologically confirmed cohort. In this population, NINCDS "probable-AD" was 100% specific, 49% sensitive, and 66% accurate; "possible-AD" was only 61% specific, but 93% sensitive and 77% accurate; and the combination of both "probable-AD" and "possible-AD" was 61% specific, 96% sensitive, and 85% accurate. DSM-III-R criteria were 51% sensitive, 97% specific, and 66% accurate. In the same cases and including the 105 living, elderly controls, the diagnostic accuracy of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA) scanning criteria showed CT alone to be 85% sensitive, 78% specific, and 80% accurate; SPECT alone had 89% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 83% accuracy; and the combination of the two was 80% sensitive, 93% specific, and 88% accurate. The Apo E4 genotype was 74% sensitive but yielded 40% false positives in the histologically confirmed series. The diagnostic accuracy afforded by this method of CT and SPECT used alone is better than that of any established clinical criteria and reveals that the combination of MTL atrophy and parietotemporal hypoperfusion is common in AD, much less common in other dementias, and rare in normal controls. In the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria "possible-AD" cases, the combination of CT and SPECT findings alone were better in all diagnostic indices than the presence of Apo E4 alone in predicting AD. The frequent occurrence of MTL atrophy in AD and also in other "non-AD" dementias later in the course of the disease suggests the concept of medial temporal lobe dementia. This could explain some of the overlap of clinical profiles in the dementi

TI  - Neuropsychological assessment in Alzheimer's disease: current status and future directions.  
AB  - Neuropsychological assessment involves the observation and measurement of an individual's behavior in relation to a given stimulus that has been selected for its likelihood to provoke an abnormal response in the presence of neurological damage. This approach incorporates a medical and psychological approach to diagnosis in that both pathology-specific signs and deviations from normal distributions are examined. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), this methodology has assumed considerable importance. This is because behavioral indicators remain the principal basis for provisional diagnosis when there are no biological markers. Observations of elderly persons with and without senile dementia have led to the development of stimuli, or tests, that are able to assess the functioning of specific cognitive processes affected in AD as opposed to more common age-associated changes. Many of these tests have been found to be culturally portable. Diagnostic difficulties arise principally from the fact that many neuropsychological tests cannot be used in isolation, from uncertainty as to the limits of "normal" functioning and from the psychometric problems related to pathological thresholds and item-weighting. The usefulness of neuropsychological testing in the future could undoubtedly be enhanced by the use of measures derived from indices of decline in functioning rather than normative data and the development of functional testing in collaboration with cerebral imaging.

TI  - Examination of the validity of the hierarchical model of neuropathological staging in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - The neuropathological staging model of Alzheimer's disease proposed by Braak and Braak [Acta Neuropathol (1991) 82:259] requires that the evolution of neurofibrillary pathology follows a predictable pattern that can be ordered in a regular regional hierarchy. We have operationalized the neuropathological staging system to permit testing of its validity. Forty-two cases were derived from an epidemiological study of cognitive function in an elderly population for which post-mortem brain tissue was collected. Cases with neuropathological diagnoses other than Alzheimer's disease and normal aging were excluded. Neurofibrillary tangle counts were determined in all cortical laminae and regions used for staging. There was a significant correlation between the overall extent of neurofibrillary pathology and the number of regions affected. There were frequent order violations in the proposed hierarchy: 19 instances (45%) involving entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices, and 16 instances (38%) involving CA1 of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Only 6 out of 42 cases conformed in all regions to the expected hierarchy. Nevertheless, 90% of the cases had 2 order violations or less, supporting the approximate validity of the hierarchy.

AB  - The goals of the treatment of paranasal sinuses mucocele are the relief of the symptoms due to compression and the prevention of recurrence. Because of the benignity of the pathology, it is mandatory to choose the approach that minimizes the surgical trauma. When an anterior clinoid mucocele is found, the conventional approaches are the trans-nasoethmoidal, the subtemporal or the pterional ones: we think that as a really mini-invasive approach, the transnasal endoscopy may be proposed. Anterior clinoid localization may be reached by a trans-sphenoidal way and treated by endoscopic microsurgery with a very low morbility. This paper deals with a case of anterior clinoid mucocele treated by this way with good anatomic and functional results and stresses the importance of the pre-operative imaging (CT/MR) allowing one to make a sure diagnosis and to choose the cases suitable for this surgical approach.

TI  - Arthroscopic capsular plication for posterior shoulder instability.  
AB  - Seventeen patients with recurrent posterior shoulder instability underwent posterior capsular plication with or without suture anchors, between 1990 and 1992. Minimum 2-year follow-up was available for 14 patients (average, 33 months; range, 24 to 45 months). The etiology involved trauma in 9 cases, recurrent microtrauma in 4 cases, and no trauma in 1 case. Posterior capsular laxity was present in all 14 cases and was believed to be the primary pathology, although 12 patients showed some form of labral pathology. The patients were interviewed and assessed in six categories: pain, strength, function, stability, range-of-motion, and satisfaction. Twelve patients had excellent results and 2 had fair results. Nine of 10 patients who participate in recreational or competitive athletics reported full return to their preinjury level of function in their respective sports. There was one recurrence of posterior shoulder instability which was remedied with a second arthroscopic posterior capsular reconstruction. All 14 patients were satisfied with the results of their surgery, and no complications were noted. Capsular plication is a promising technique in the treatment of recurrent posterior shoulder instability.

AB  - IL-12p70, a 70- to 75-kDa heterodimer consisting of disulfide-bonded 35-kDa (p35) and 40-kDa (p40) subunits, enhances Th1 development primarily by its ability to induce IFN-gamma production by NK and Th1 cells. Although homodimers of the p40 subunit of IL-12 are potent IL-12 receptor antagonists in some systems, we have reported that p40 homodimer may accentuate alloreactive CD8+ Th1 function. To test the role of endogenously produced p40 in alloimmunity, Th1 development was assessed in either IL-12 p35 knockout (p35-/-) mice, the cells of which are capable of secreting p40, or p40 knockout (p40-/-) mice. Compared with IL-12 wild-type controls, splenocytes obtained from both p35-/- and p40-/- mice produced markedly less IFN-gamma after in vitro stimulation with Con A or alloantigens. Interestingly, in vivo-sensitized Th1 were detected in both p35-/- and p40-/- cardiac allograft recipients. However, in vivo Th1 development was enhanced in p35-/- recipients compared with p40-/- animals, suggesting that endogenous p40 produced in p35-/- mice may stimulate alloreactive Th1. Indeed, neutralizing endogenous p40 with anti-IL-12 p40 mAb reduced Th1 development in p35-/- allograft recipients to that seen in p40-/- mice. To determine whether Th1 development that occurred in the absence of IL-12p70 and p40 required IFN-gamma, p40-/- allograft recipients were treated with anti-IFN-gamma mAb. Neutralizing IFN-gamma did not inhibit in vivo Th1 development in p40-/- recipients and resulted in a unique pathology of rejection characterized by vascular thromboses. Collectively, these data suggest that 1) endogenous p40 may substitute for IL-12p70 in alloantigen-specific Th1 sensitization in vivo and 2) in vivo alloreactive Th1 development may occur independent of IL-12 and IFN-gamma, suggesting an alternate Th1-sensitizing pathway.

TI  - Report of validation study of assessment of direct immunotoxicity in the rat. The ICICIS Group Investigators. International Collaborative Immunotoxicity Study.  
AB  - The International Collaborative Immunotoxicity Study (ICICIS) was established in 1986 as a joint activity of the International Programme on Chemical Safety (a cooperative programme of the United Nations Environment Programme, the International Labour Office and the World Health Organization), the Commission of the European Union and the United Kingdom Department of Health. The objectives were to examine whether various experimental techniques could be used in the rat to indicate toxic effects on the immune system, and so to suggest their possible value as general indicators of immunotoxicity. For this purpose scientists in a number of laboratories in different countries agreed to do joint studies, first of azathioprine (AZA) and then of cyclosporin A (CYA), as potent immunosuppressive compounds. The general experimental procedures and the detailed techniques employed were selected to explore whether the limited pathological investigations in the conventional 28-day subacute toxicity test in the rat (OECD, 1995), or 'Enhanced Pathology' tests (weight determination and examination of additional lymphoid organs and application of structured assessment and semiquantitative grading of changes in the principal compartments of lymphoid tissues) would suffice to indicate ('flag') the occurrence of immunotoxicity due to a chemical, or whether specific tests of immune function would be required. When the second chemical, CYA, was studied, standardisation of the protocol for the test, and of all the investigations, and prior training of the toxicological pathologists in the structured assessment scheme, were shown to greatly reduce interlaboratory variation in the results. The initial investigation of AZA had shown that the indicative power of the experiments had been diminished by the use of diverse experimental procedures. The studies were done as toxicity tests, in which three dose levels, including the maximum tolerated dose, and a vehicle control group were employed. The prime objective was to detect any immunotoxic effect of the test compound. It was shown that the limited, basic 'Pathology' investigations specified in Guideline 407 (OECD, 1981) were not able to reveal the effects on the immune system of AZA and CYA, but that several of the additional 'Enhanced Pathology' investigations did so. Of the immune function assays, the most reliable and useful was the 'Antibody Forming Cell' technique. Other immunological evaluations, such as examination of proliferation induced by selected mitogens and NK cell assay, showed promise. The methods employed have the potential to reveal an 'immunotoxic' effect, without necessarily indicating its mechanism, although the changes in different lymphoid compartments can afford a valuable guide to the detailed nature of the toxic action on the immune system. Function tests, being inherently quantitative in nature may well suggest the nature or mechanism of any effect seen, in addition to indicating the occurrence of the effect. However, they may be less convenient to do as part of a routine toxicity test. Overall, the work in ICICIS has shown that the immunotoxic actions of two chemicals were detectable within a 28-day subacute oral toxicity test in the rat, provided that the conventional laboratory procedures were extended to include extra investigations. Both additional selected pathology investigations and immune function tests 'flagged' the immunotoxicity.

TI  - Craniofacial access in children.  
AB  - We have used craniofacial access in 20 children (age range 3/12-14 years) for complex skull base/intracranial pathology over the past 5 years. The majority of the patients had a tumour-7 of the skull base, 5 extensive suprasellar lesions and 3 acoustic neuromas; 4 had an aneurysm or AVM and in 1 there was a congenital problem. This extended application of established adult techniques in a paediatric practice emphasises the fundamental point that the quintessence of good surgical practice is the construction of an operation for the individual patient's pathology. We therefore used transzygomatic, orbital, transoral, transmandibular, petrous, transcondylar, translabyrinthine and transbasal access techniques. Good function and cosmesis with minimal complications were achieved. We have not observed complications with craniofacial growth and the majority of patients were able to return to normal school. The range of approaches used emphasise the importance of a multidisciplinary team with both paediatric and neurosurgical expertise, especially with complex vascular and skull base pathology, in dealing with these difficult problems. The case for specialist referral merits some discussion within the representative bodies of paediatric neurosurgeons.

TI  - Tamoxifen associated uterine pathology in breast cancer patients with abnormal bleeding.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the underlying pathology in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen who present with abnormal bleeding. A total of 56 cases were studied and the histopathologic features of 50 curettage and 18 laparotomy specimens were reviewed. All patients were under tamoxifen treatment (10-40 mg daily) for a period ranging from 5 months to 15 years. Cervical and endometrial polyps were the most common finding in the D and C material (44%). Hyperplasia was the most frequent feature identified at hysterectomy, often combined with leiomyomas, adenomyosis and ovarian tumors. Five primary adenocarcinomas of the endometrium, most of them Stage I beta, Grade I minimally invading, were found as well. These data support the hypothesis that tamoxifen exerts a proliferative estrogen-like effect on the uterus. Abnormal bleeding in women under TAM treatment warrants prompt investigation and careful follow up of the patients.

TI  - Comparison of PCR and microscopy for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum in human fecal specimens: clinical trial.  
AB  - PCR technology offers alternatives to conventional diagnosis of Cryptosporidium for both clinical and environmental samples. We compared microscopic examination by a conventional acid-fast staining procedure with a recently developed PCR test that can not only detect Cryptosporidium but is also able to differentiate between what appear to be host-adapted genotypes of the parasite. Examinations were performed on 511 stool specimens referred for screening on the basis of diarrhea. PCR detected a total of 36 positives out of the 511 samples, while routine microscopy detected 29 positives. Additional positives detected by PCR were eventually confirmed to be positive by microscopy. A total of five samples that were positive by routine microscopy at Western Diagnostic Pathology but negative by PCR and by microscopy in our laboratory were treated as false positives. Microscopy therefore exhibited 83.7% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity compared to PCR. PCR was more sensitive and easier to interpret but required more hands-on time to perform and was more expensive than microscopy. PCR, however, was very adaptable to batch analysis, reducing the costs considerably. Bulk buying of reagents and modifications to the procedure would decrease the cost of the PCR test even more. An important advantage of the PCR test, its ability to directly differentiate between different Cryptosporidium genotypes, will assist in determining the source of cryptosporidial outbreaks. Sensitivity, specificity, ability to genotype, ease of use, and adaptability to batch testing make PCR a useful tool for future diagnosis and studies on the molecular epidemiology of Cryptosporidium infections.

TI  - T cell-mediated pathology in two models of experimental colitis depends predominantly on the interleukin 12/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-4 pathway, but is not conditional on interferon gamma expression by T cells.  
AB  - The requirements for interleukin (IL)-12/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-4 signaling and induction of T cell-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma expression in the development of T helper cell (Th)1-type pathology were examined in two different models of experimental colitis. In each model, abnormal reconstitution of the T cell compartment in immunodeficient mice by adoptive cell transfer leads to a wasting syndrome and inflammation of the colon, induced by IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-producing T cells. We show here that treatment with anti-IL-12 antibodies in one of the models, or reconstitution with T cells from Stat-4-deficient (Stat-4(null)) mice in both models resulted in a milder disease in the majority of recipient animals, compared with those that were left untreated or that had been reconstituted with wt cells. Protected mice in each group also harbored lower frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing T cells than did diseased mice, suggesting that effects on wasting and colitis resulted from the attenuation of IFN-gamma expression by T cells. To test whether the development of pathogenic T cells in the two colitis models was directly dependent on T cell-specific IFN-gamma expression, IFN-gammanull donors were used for T cell reconstitution in each system. Surprisingly, large numbers of IFN-gammanull-reconstituted mice developed wasting and colitis, which in many cases was of comparable severity to that seen in animals reconstituted with wt cells. Furthermore, T cells from these animals expressed TNF-alpha, demonstrating that they had retained the ability to produce another proinflammatory cytokine. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in some forms of chronic experimental colitis the development of pathogenic T cells is influenced predominantly, though not exclusively, by IL-12 via the actions of Stat-4 proteins. Furthermore, our data suggest that in the models of colitis studied here the effects of IL-12/Stat-4 or other Th1 promoting pathways are not limited to the induction of IFN-gamma gene expression in T lymphocytes.

TI  - Recovery of arm function in patients with paresis after traumatic brain injury.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the frequency of recovery of arm paresis in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to rehabilitation. DESIGN: Retrospective review identifying a cohort of patients with moderate or severe arm paresis after TBI followed at least 6 months postinjury. SETTING: Freestanding acute rehabilitation hospital TBI unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with moderate to severe arm paresis were selected from 264 consecutive admissions and characterized by injury pathology subtype, injury severity (duration of unconsciousness [loss of consciousness, LOC] and posttraumatic amnesia [PTA]), age, and level of paresis according to Brunnstrom Stages of Recovery (BS 1 to 6). Patient groups with and without arm paresis were compared according to these variables (t tests and chi(2)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recovery of arm paresis to isolated motor function (BS 5 or 6) and time to achieve recovery. Recovered and nonrecovered patients were compared (Mann-Whitney, t tests, and chi(2)) on injury severity, initial level of paresis, age, time to rehabilitation admission, and pathology subtype. Time to recovery was compared for patients at different levels of initial paresis, ranges of LOC, and pathology subtypes (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests). RESULTS: Forty-four patients (17%) had moderate (BS 3 to 4) or severe (BS 1 to 2) paresis at rehabilitation admission. They were more severely injured than nonparetic patients based on longer LOC (p < .002) and PTA (p < .009). Thirty-six patients (82%) recovered by 6 months; 72% of these recovered by 2 months. If still paretic at 2 months, only 56% recovered. Mean recovery time was 6.9 weeks (SD, 6.1) from injury. Time to recovery was best predicted by initial level of paresis and injury severity (r2 = .48), but not age. Patients with diffuse injury tended towards a more protracted recovery (7.9 weeks, SD 6.5) than patients with focal injury (4.2 weeks, SD 3.9) (p = .08) and only those with diffuse injury showed further recovery after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Arm paresis after TBI is relatively infrequent. Most patients recover by 2 months but later recovery is possible, especially in patients with primarily diffuse brain damage. Recovery is highly related to initial impairment, injury severity, and distribution of brain injury.

TI  - Malignant epithelial tumors of the lacrimal gland: a clinicopathologic study of 21 cases.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze 120 lacrimal gland masses collected during a 23-year period in the Ophthalmic Pathology Laboratory at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Tex. METHODS: Of the 120 lacrimal gland tumors, we focused on a detailed clinicopathologic study of 21 malignant epithelial tumors. Follow-up was available in 19 (90%) of 21 cases. RESULTS: About two thirds of the masses (75 cases) were inflammatory, one third (41 cases) were of epithelial origin, and 3% (4 cases) were malignant lymphomas. Of the epithelial tumors, 17 (41%) were benign mixed tumors, 12 (29%) were adenoid cystic carcinomas arising de novo, 2 (5%) were adenocarcinoma arising de novo, 7 (17%) were malignant mixed tumors, and 3 (7%) were metastatic carcinoma. All of the patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma had local recurrences, and 60% of the patients died of their tumors (mean survival, 5 years); only 2 patients were alive 13 and 16 years after the initial surgery, both of whom had radical surgical procedures for recurrence following orbital exenteration. CONCLUSION: The histopathologic classification and management of these tumors are discussed. This study supports the dismal prognosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma arising de novo.

TI  - Clinical and radiological evaluation of zinc oxide-eugenol and Maisto's paste as obturating materials in infected primary teeth--nine months study.  
AB  - The present study, performed in-vivo, included 30 infected primary teeth in 26 children in the age group of 3-8 years. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two obturating materials, zinc oxide-eugenol and Maisto's paste, in infected primary teeth. 30 teeth were divided into two groups of 15 teeth. Teeth in Group I were obturated using zinc oxide-eugenol and those in Group II were obturated using Maisto's paste. On clinical evaluation, teeth obturated with Maisto's paste showed 100% success. Five teeth that were overfilled with Maisto's paste showed complete resorption of excess material within 3 months while the two teeth overfilled with zinc oxide-eugenol showed incomplete resorption of the excess material even after 9 months. Zinc oxide-eugenol treated cases showed only 26.7% bone regeneration while in case of Maisto's paste, it was 93%. Complete healing of the inter-radicular pathology was seen with Maisto's paste. However, the pathology was present in 40% of the zinc oxide-eugenol treated teeth even after 9 months. Maisto's paste was thus seen to be superior to zinc oxide-eugenol both in clinical as well as radiological evaluation, done over a period of 9 months in relation to bone regeneration, healing of inter-radicular pathology and resorption of excess material.

TI  - Sparing of mdx extraocular muscles from dystrophic pathology is not attributable to normalized concentration or distribution of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.  
AB  - Previous findings have led to speculations that decreased concentration of nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) may underlie some aspects of the pathophysiology of dystrophic muscle. We have tested whether the sparing of extraocular muscles (EOM) in muscular dystrophy is attributable to the presence of normal nNOS concentration and distribution in these muscles. Measurements of total nNOS concentration in control muscle showed that total nNOS comprises approximately 0.05% of total muscle protein, indicating a molar stoichiometry of approximately 60 and 20 to total dystrophin and syntrophin, respectively. Thus, most muscle nNOS is either not associated with the dystrophin complex, or binds to yet unidentified sites in the complex. nNOS concentration was at least two-fold greater in C57 EOM and tibialis anterior (TA) compared with mdx samples. No significant differences in nNOS concentration in EOM versus TA in either mdx or C57 mice were observed, nNOS was concentrated at the sarcolemma of all C57 samples, while mdx nNOS displayed a cytosolic distribution, except in fibers that reverted to express dystrophin. These data show that mdx EOM are spared by a mechanism other than normalized concentration and location of nNOS.

TI  - Neuropathological syndromes in the course of full blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in adults in Poland (1987-1995).  
AB  - Morphological analysis of the brains from 100 cases of full blown AIDS patients observed in the course of 1987-1995 years was performed. The material comprised 96 males, 3 females and 1 infant, 11 months old. Early material consisted almost exclusively of homo- and bisexuals, while in the last years heterosexual drug addicts prevailed. Gross brain examination revealed focal changes in 25% of cases, most of them being connected either with opportunistic infections or primary proliferating malignancies. Brain atrophy with an evident regional differences was observed macroscopically in 35 cases. Microscopic examination allowed detection of pathological changes in the brains of 87 cases, although in the remaining 13 cases there occurred some slight abnormalities taking the form of non-specific neuronal degeneration and loss, considered as resulting from perimortal cardio-pulmonary insufficiency or bleeding. Specific HIV-related changes in the form of HIV-encephalitis, HIV-encephalopathy or coexistence of both and HIV-leptomeningitis as well as HIV-vasculitis were present in 35 cases. They were accompanied by HIV-associated changes (vacuolar myelopathy, vacuolar leukoencephalopathy and selective poliodystrophy). Very seldom they appeared as independent pathological features and were characterized by very low frequency. Opportunistic infections composed the largest group of 59 cases. Proliferative malignancies occurred altogether in eleven cases, 10 of which were primary and secondary brain lymphomas. One case of Kaposi sarcoma completed the neoplastic series. Sixteen cases revealed various types of brain pathology such as hepatogenic encephalopathy, traumatic cortical scars, central pontine myelinolysis etc. The 59 cases of opportunistic infections consisted of a wide spectrum of viral and bacterial as well as fungal and protozoan infections. Among viral infections cytomegalovirus encephalitis was the most common, way ahead the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The second in frequency among opportunistic infections was brain toxoplasmosis and some fungal infections such as cryptococcosis and aspergillosis. Bacterial infections were in fact limited to tuberculosis, taking the form of granulomatous leptomeningitis with severe vascular pathology and/or tuberculoma formation. Many pathological processes appearing in a single case was characteristic feature of our collection. There was coexistence of HIV-specific CNS pathology and opportunistic infections, malignant neoplastic growth and other types of pathology. Various opportunistic infections coexisted without HIV-specific changes as well as malignant proliferation with opportunistic infections. Similarities and differences of our series were compared with data characterizing other, earlier collections of NeuroAIDS.

AB  - Four hundred and seventy villagers of Ndombo, a village with recently established intensive transmission of Schistosoma mansoni in the Senegal River Basin, were enrolled in a study with the intention to assess hepatosplenic morbidity. All patients were examined parasitologically and by ultrasound. Hepatic fibrosis serum markers were determined in 153 adult patients (aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type III, hyaluronan and laminin). By ultrasound, about 60% of the patients showed early stages of hepatic involvement, 3% of the patients unequivocally showed severe hepatosplenic pathology (grade 3 according to the Managil classification), whereas in another study performed in the same village 3 years earlier, no patients with severe hepatosplenic pathology had been found. No correlation between the aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type III, hyaluronan or laminin and the ultrasound findings could be established. These hepatic fibrosis serum markers do not seem to be a sensitive method to detect early hepatic fibrosis in schistosomiasis.

TI  - Combined post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and resection of chest tumor under the same anesthetic is appropriate based on morbidity and tumor pathology [published erratum appears in J Urol 1998 Oct;160(4):1444]  
AB  - PURPOSE: We determine if post-chemotherapy resection of residual retroperitoneal and chest tumor under the same anesthetic is reasonable based on tumor pathology and morbidity, and if the finding of necrosis in the abdomen allows observation of chest tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 143 post-chemotherapy patients who underwent resection of residual retroperitoneal and chest disease under the same anesthetic. RESULTS: Retroperitoneal pathology was generally predictive of chest pathology. Concordance existed in 77.5% of patients with necrosis, 70% with teratoma and 69% with cancer of the abdomen. However, the correlation was much stronger (86%) in predicting necrosis/fibrosis if cases were categorized as uncomplicated by Indiana University criteria. Although the morbidity of the combined approach is higher than that of standard post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, it was acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity of post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and resection of chest disease under the same anesthetic is acceptable.  Retroperitoneal pathology generally predicts chest pathology but this correlation is much stronger if the case is uncomplicated based on our criteria. In an uncomplicated case the discovery of necrosis of the abdomen allows observation of chest tumor.

TI  - Diagnostic concordance of telecytology and conventional cytology for evaluating breast aspirates.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic concordance between static electronic images versus glass slides for breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. STUDY DESIGN: Nine malignant and 12 benign breast FNA cases were imaged using the Roche Image Manager, at a resolution of 1,024 x 768 pixels. A cytotechnologist or pathology resident selected five to nine representative images per case. Case histories and images were assembled into hypertext documents. Two pathologist blindly made diagnoses for each case based on the images and the clinical history and independently made diagnoses for the glass slides, also evaluating each set of images and glass slides for a list of cellular features. RESULTS: The two pathologist had concordance rates of 90.5% and 66.7% between their image and glass diagnoses. For each pathologist's discordant cases, 100.0% and 85.7%, respectively, were due chiefly to suspicious rather than definitive diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the electronic images indicated that almost all the cellular features were comparable to those viewed though a microscope.

TI  - [First experience with the laryngeal intubation mask]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J. Brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask. METHODS: In the ILMA, a number of construction details were newly designed compared to a standard laryngeal mask airway (SLM): 1) the angle between the shaft and the mask plane is changed, and also the radius of the shaft, 2) the internal diameter of the shaft is increased to allow the passage of an 8.0 mm cuffed endotracheal tube, resulting in an outer diameter of 2.0 cm, 3) a stable rubber lip (epiglottic elevating bar) is incorporated instead of the gills to clear the epiglottis out of the lumen during the passage of the endotracheal tube, 4) the shaft is manufactured out of stainless steel covered by silicone with a handle attached for more precise guidance. We prospectively used the ILMA in 80 patients for blind intubation. 51 had normal anatomy (group I), 19 were difficult to intubate (Cormack grade 3-4; group II), 18 had a reduced mouth opening (< or = 2.5 cm awake; group III), 8 of them also were difficult to intubate. RESULTS: Insertion of the ILMA and ventilation was possible in all patients but one with a mouth opening of 1.3 cm during anaesthesia. 4 patients with difficult intubation and one with normal anatomy could not be ventilated with a face mask but could be ventilated with the ILMA. Blind intubation was successful in 69 out of 80 patients (global success rate 87%; group I: 84%; II: 95%; III: 83%), in 38 during the first attempt (initial success rate 48%; group I: 45%; II: 63%; III: 44%), showing no difference for patients with normal anatomy, difficult intubation or reduced mouth opening. For 82 successful intubations, 157 intubation attempts were performed (success rate per attempt 52%; group I: 48%; II: 67%; III: 54%). Success rate per attempt decreased to 42%, if intubation was not successful during the first attempt (106 intubation attempts resulting in 44 successful intubations, including 31 intubation attempts for 11 failures; group I: 35%; II: 56%; III: 38%). Intubation through the ILMA was not possible in 11 patients (14%). Failures to intubate were caused by a reduced mouth opening in 1 patient, an unsuited endotracheal tube in 1 patient, a wrong size of the ILMA may have been the cause in 6 patients, in the remaining 3, lacking personal skill may have been responsible. Endotracheal tubes suited to be used with the ILMA are straight or preformed Woodbridge tubes, whereas standard plastic tubes are too stiff. Manouvres facilitating blind intubation though the ILMA were careful alignment of the ILMA with the handle, an up and down manouvre, rotation of the tube or head movements. CONCLUSION: The ILMA improved ventilation compared to a face mask and almost doubled the success rate of blind intubation compared to a SLM in our hands in a variety of intubation situations. The ILMA has the potential to be useful in difficult to intubate patients--except those with cervical pathology--or in emergency medicine. Handling can be trained during every day routine. Experienced judgement of definite endotracheal tube placement is mandatory.

TI  - In vitro cellular toxicity predicts Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence in lung infections.  
AB  - The role of quorum sensing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in producing cytotoxicity has not been fully investigated. Strains of P. aeruginosa have been characterized as having an invasive or a cytotoxic phenotype (S. M. J. Fleiszig et al., Infect. Immun. 65:579-586, 1997). We noted that the application of a large inoculum of the invasive strain 6294 caused cytotoxicity of cultured epithelial cells. To investigate this dose-related cytotoxicity, we compared the behavior of 6294 to that of another invasive strain, PAO1, and determined whether the cytotoxicity could be related to quorum sensing. Both invasive strains, 6294 and PAO1, appear to have quorum-sensing systems that were operative when large doses of bacteria were applied to cultured lung epithelial cells or instilled into the lungs of animals. Nonetheless, only 6294 was cytotoxic. Cytotoxicity induced by 6294 correlated with increased elastase production. These experiments suggest that there are multiple mechanisms for the induction of cytotoxicity, pathology, and mortality in vivo. However, in vivo cytotoxicity and mortality, but not pathology, could be predicted by quantitative in vitro cellular damage experiments utilizing a range of bacteria-to-cell ratios. It appears that quorum sensing may inversely correlate with virulence in that strains that produced PAI [N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone] also appeared to attract more polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vivo and were possibly eliminated more quickly. In addition, exoproduct production in bacteriological medium in vitro may differ significantly from exoproduct expression from infections in vivo or during cocultivation of bacteria with tissue culture cells.

TI  - Contrast sensitivity after implantation of diffractive bifocal and monofocal intraocular lenses.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare contrast sensitivity (CS) after implantation of a diffractive bifocal intraocular lens (IOL) and a monofocal IOL of similar design. SETTING: Seven European centers. METHODS: In this randomized, prospective study, CS was tested 5 months after cataract and IOL implantation surgery in 115 patients with a diffractive bifocal IOL and 106 patients with a monofocal IOL. It was also tested in a subgroup of 38 patients who had bilateral implantation of a diffractive bifocal IOL. Contrast sensitivity was tested using the Vision Contrast Test System (VCTS). RESULTS: In patients with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 1.0 or better, the CS at all spatial frequencies (1.5 to 18 cycles/degree), both at distance and near, was slightly lower in the bifocal IOL group than in the monofocal group. Mean values were within the normal range. In patients with a BCVA of less than 1.0, the CS was lower and the difference between the bifocal and monofocal groups was less. In patients with bilateral bifocal IOLs, CS was better when tested bilaterally than when testing the better eye alone. Pupil size affected the results to a small degree. Contrast sensitivity appeared to improve over time after implantation of a diffractive bifocal IOL. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cataract and no other eye pathology, the diffractive bifocal IOL with slightly reduce the CS at all spatial frequencies. In those with reduced visual acuity after cataract surgery, CS will be reduced accordingly. In this situation, the reduction from the diffractive bifocal optic would be minor.

TI  - Possible antecedents of DSM-III-R personality disorders.  
AB  - In order to extend our knowledge of the effects of environmental influences upon personality disorder (PD) pathology, childhood traumatic events and parental bonding were studied in 90 PD in-patients of both sexes. Childhood traumatic experiences (primarily physical and/or sexual abuse) and parental bonding dimensions were correlated with PD pathology depending on PD type and cluster. Important differences were found between the sexes. The quality of the paternal relationship (high control, low care) was significantly associated with PD pathology in men, whereas childhood traumatic experiences and the quality of maternal parenting were associated with PD pathology in women. The study of traumatic events such as childhood abuse has recently been the focus of considerable attention. More emphasis in empirical research needs to be given to parental relationships, especially in the case of men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the structure, specificity, and in vivo pathogenetic potential of 2 human anticardiolipin (aCL) monoclonal antibodies (MAb). METHODS: Human aCL IgG MAb were generated from hybridized Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell lines from a healthy subject (MAb 519) and from a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (MAb 516). Studies of antigen-binding specificity and analysis of Ig V-gene mutations were carried out. The MAb were independently injected into mated female BALB/c mice, and their effect on pregnancy outcome was compared with that of MAb 57, a highly mutated and antigen-selected human IgG1lambda rabies virus antibody. RESULTS: Both MAb 519 and MAb 516 utilized minimally mutated V(H)DJ(H) and VkappaJkappa gene segments and bound cardiolipin and other anionic phospholipids in the absence of beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI). The mice injected with aCL MAb displayed a significantly higher rate of fetal resorption and a significant reduction in fetal and placental weight as compared with those injected with MAb 57. These findings were accompanied by a finding of placental human IgG deposition and necrosis in the aCL MAb-treated animals. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that human aCL IgG that are beta2-GPI independent can induce pathology.

TI  - New developments in mitral valve repair.  
AB  - The etiology of mitral valve disease is changing. The predominance of rheumatic pathology has given way to degenerative pathology in an increasingly elderly population. Mitral valve conservation by repair rather than replacement has several advantages. Repair is associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolism, hemolysis, and infectious endocarditis. For patients in sinus rhythm, thromboembolism is rare and anticoagulation can be discontinued. Repair also is associated with improved long-term survival. This article reviews the current literature on different types of surgical techniques for repair of the mitral valve and discusses future trends.

TI  - Qualifying the cytologic diagnosis of "atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance" affects the predictive value of a squamous intraepithelial lesion on subsequent biopsy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether different qualifications of a cytologic diagnosis of "atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance" predict a greater or lesser likelihood of cervical pathology. DESIGN: Comparison of different cytologic qualifications of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance with the frequency of significant cervical disease as documented by tissue biopsy. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Four hundred, fifty-two consecutive Papanicolaou smears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (diagnosed by nine cytopathologists) in women who had undergone cervical biopsy within the previous 90 days at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass (January-June 1995). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The histopathologic diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix. RESULTS: The 452 smears were qualified as "favor reactive" (22%), "not otherwise specified" (42%), "favor squamous intraepithelial lesion" (29%), and "favor high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" (6%). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and total squamous intraepithelial lesions were pathologically confirmed by cervical biopsy in 3.6% and 6% of the favor reactive smears, in 11% and 21% of the not otherwise specified smears, in 12% and 30% of the favor squamous intraepithelial lesion smears, and in 53% and 59% of the favor high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion smears. Significant associations were seen between a favor reactive smear and a benign finding on cervical biopsy (94%, P = .04) and between a favor high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion smear and a biopsy that showed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (53%, P = .00001). CONCLUSIONS: Qualifying atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance stratifies women into different risk groups for squamous intraepithelial lesion. It is reasonable for physicians to make patient management decisions based, at least in part, on such qualifications.

TI  - The relationship between hepatitis C virus and schistosomiasis: histopathologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens.  
AB  - The reported high incidence of anti-HCV seropositivity in the Egyptian population seems surprising. Some suggest that schistosomiasis is the responsible factor, either by producing false positivity for HCV antibodies or by predisposing to actual HCV infection in some way. In an attempt to investigate this unclear relationship on a histological level, we performed a thorough semiquantitative morphological study of liver biopsy specimens from 44 anti-HCV-positive Egyptian patients with chronic liver disease. More than half of these patients (23) had serological evidence of schistosomiasis. The results have shown that all 44 liver biopsy specimens demonstrated the histopathological features known to be characteristic of chronic HCV hepatitis. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the schistosomal and nonschistosomal groups regarding the semiquantitative histological scores of these features. This study confirms the presence of definite HCV-induced hepatic pathology in all anti-HCV seropositive cases. More importantly, it shows the lack of enhancement of this pathology in the schistosomal patients.

Kinetic parameters (Bmax and KD) were determined by means of quantitative autoradiography using [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1 ,3-dipropylxanthine as a radioligand. A significant 50% reduction of CA1 adenosine A1 receptors was observed in patients with dementia independent of the specific pathology. These results suggest that loss of hippocampal adenosine A1 receptors in dementia is not specific for Alzheimer type pathology.

TI  - Bedside emergency department ultrasonography plus radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder vs intravenous pyelography in the evaluation of suspected ureteral colic [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of bedside renal ultrasonography (US) and plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) as the initial investigative modality for those patients presenting to the ED with unilateral flank pain and hematuria. The hypothesis was that the renal US + KUB may obviate the need for emergent i.v. pyelography (i.v.P) in a majority of patients. METHODS: Prospective study over an 8-month period of all consecutive adult patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years presenting with unilateral flank pain and hematuria to the ED at LAC + USC Medical Center. Patients received KUB followed by a 500-mL bolus of normal saline. Bedside US was then performed by emergency physicians (EPs). Hydronephrosis of the kidney was graded as mild, moderate, or severe. All patients then underwent i.v.P. The results of the bedside US + KUB were then compared with those of i.v.P (the criterion standard). RESULTS: Of a total of 139 eligible patients, 108 were enrolled. The combination of US and KUB correctly identified pathology consistent with nephroureterolithiasis with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI = 93.1-100%) when compared with i.v.P. The KUB + US results were falsely positive in 16 patients, resulting in a specificity of 58.9% (95% CI = 43.5-74.3%). The positive predictive value of the combined modality was 80.7%, the negative predictive value was 92.0%, and the overall accuracy was 83.3%. CONCLUSION: The bedside US + KUB has a high sensitivity and can be performed rapidly at the bedside by the EP when compared with i.v.P. This combined modality is an effective screening tool in the initial evaluation of ureteral colic.

Depending on the levels of disease foci as well as nature thereof and pattern of the pathology in question, the author has identified syndromological complexes of oculomotor disorders, including the original ones having pathognostic significance in respect of CNS functional abnormalities as well as of demyelinating and infectious processes. He gives his view on pathogenesis of development of those oculomotor disorders posing a problem in differential diagnosis, regarding it as consequence of dominating of injury to particular efferent structures of brain truncal formations.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta production is inversely correlated with severity of murine malaria infection.  
AB  - We have examined the role of the immunomodulatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in the resolution and pathology of malaria in BALB/c mice. Circulating levels of TGF-beta, and production of bioactive TGF-beta by splenocytes, were found to be low in lethal infections with Plasmodium berghei. In contrast, resolving infections with P. chabaudi chabaudi or P. yoelii were accompanied by significant TGF-beta production. A causal association between the failure to produce TGF-beta and the severity of malaria infection was demonstrated by treatment of infected mice with neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta, which exacerbated the virulence of P. berghei and transformed a resolving P. chabaudi chabaudi infection into a lethal infection, but had little effect on the course of P. yoelii infection. Parasitemia increased more rapidly in anti-TGF-beta-treated mice but this did not seem to be the explanation for the increased pathology of infection as peak parasitemias were unchanged. Treatment of P. berghei-infected mice with recombinant TGF-beta (rTGF-beta) slowed the rate of parasite proliferation and prolonged their survival from 15 to up to 35 d. rTGF-beta treatment was accompanied by a significant decrease in serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and an increase in interleukin 10. Finally, we present evidence that differences in TGF-beta responses in different malaria infections are due to intrinsic differences between species of malaria parasites in their ability to induce production of TGF-beta. Thus, TGF-beta seems to induce protective immune responses, leading to slower parasite growth, early in infection, and, subsequently, appears to downregulate pathogenic responses late in infection. This duality of effect makes TGF-beta a prime candidate for a major immunomodulatory cytokine associated with successful control of malaria infection.

TI  -  Gastrointestinal pathology in rhesus monkeys with experimental SIV infection.  
AB  - The updated results of current pathomorphological investigations in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are summarized. After experimental infection with several SIVmac251 subtypes and various vaccination trails, 147 rhesus monkeys were morphologically examined until now. The pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in SIV-infected animals resembled those of human cases with HIV and AIDS. Alterations were considered to be primary SIV-induced (SIV enteropathy, giant cell disease) or secondary caused by opportunistic agents. Typical secondary gastrointestinal opportunistic infectious agents were parasites (Cryptosporidium sp., Trichuris sp., Trichomonas sp., Spironucleus sp.), viruses (cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and bacteria (Mycobacterium simiae). Five animals developed malignant lymphomas involving the intestinal tract. The present observations revealed that SIV infection of rhesus monkeys provide an excellent model for studies on the pathogenesis of HIV in man.

TI  - Management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in colonic diverticular disease.  
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the clinical course, diagnostic approach, therapeutic measures and results, in a series of 13 patients with colonic bleeding diverticula. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1973 to 1995, 72 patients were admitted with the diagnosis of lower gastroin testinal bleeding. Thirteen presented a colonic diverticula bleeding. Mean age was 65.2 years. Medical history, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment (conservative or surgical) and pathology were recorded. RESULTS: Main bleeding time was 3 days. Eight patients needed blood transfusion. All patients underwent colonoscopic examination and it was diagnostic in every patient. Four patients underwent surgery: one case, because of massive hemorrhage and the other three cases due to bleeding recurrence. Pancolectomy was performed in one patient, ileal resection in another and the other two were treated with a sigmoidectomy and a left hemicolectomy.  Pathology analysis corroborated colonic diverticula diagnosis. There was no postoperative mortality. Bleeding recurrence did not occur either in postoperative period or in the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Colonic diverticular bleeding usually stops spontaneously, obtaining high rates of preoperative diagnosis with colonoscopy. Less than a third of the cases requires surgical resection.

TI  - Modeling of eating pathology and social reinforcement of the thin-ideal predict onset of bulimic symptoms.  
AB  - Although social influences are thought to promote bulimic pathology, little research has examined the effects of multiple socialization agents, or considered both modeling and social reinforcement processes. Accordingly, these two studies tested whether social reinforcement of the thin-ideal, and modeling of abnormal eating behavior by family, peers, and the media, (i) correlated with bulimic symptoms in a sample of young adult female (N = 114) and (ii) predicted the onset of bulimic behavior in a sample of adolescent females (N = 218). Social reinforcement of the thin-ideal by family, peers, and media was correlated with bulimic symptoms; family and peer social reinforcement prospectively predicted the onset of binge eating and purging. Family and peer, but not media, modeling of abnormal eating behavior was associated with concurrent bulimic symptoms, and predicted the onset of binge eating and purging. Results suggest that both social reinforcement and modeling processes may promote bulimic pathology, but imply that the effects are limited to family and peer influences.

TI  - Chemokine regulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis: temporal and spatial expression patterns govern disease pathogenesis.  
AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a CD4+ Th1-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). There are several considerations that suggest a role for chemokines in the disease process. First, chemokines are highly expressed in the central nervous system with a tight temporal relationship to disease activity. Second, in vivo neutralization studies showed a distinct role for specific chemokines in the evolution of the process. Third, the selective and differential expression of chemokines in differing models of EAE bears a close relationship to the patterns of inflammatory pathology. Fourth, the spatial distribution of chemokine expression could plausibly contribute to lesion architecture. Finally, preliminary observations in MS material suggest that chemokine expression observed in EAE may provide useful information regarding the pathogenesis of inflammation in MS. We propose that temporal and spatial expression of chemokines are crucial factors, complementing adhesion molecule up-regulation, that regulate EAE disease activity.

TI  - Plasma concentration, kinetic constants, and gene polymorphism of angiotensin I-converting enzyme in centenarians.  
AB  - We have determined serum activity and kinetic constants of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), parallel to an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in its gene, in French centenarians and controls 20-70 years of age because this enzyme could have an impact on cardiovascular risk, and thus on longevity. Both the ACE D allele and ACE D/D genotype were more frequent in centenarians in comparison with controls, without sex-related differences nor significant correlation with a cardiovascular pathology. In centenarians, I/D polymorphism was correlated with circulating ACE activity (D/D genotype, 89.0 +/- 36.8 U/L; I/D genotype, 63.5 +/- 26.0 U/L; and I/I genotype, 55.1 +/- 39.4 U/L). The Michaelis constants for two substrates were identical whatever the genotype and were not different between centenarians and controls, i.e., 0.30 +/- 0.03 mmol/L for furylacryloyl-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine and 1.35 +/- 0.05 mmol/L for hippuryl-histidyl-leucine; for the latter, the optimal pH and activating concentration of chloride did not depend on I/D polymorphism. The maximal velocities with both substrates reflected the distribution of serum ACE activity as a function of the genotypes, in centenarians and in controls. In conclusion, plasma ACE activity is subject to a similar genotypic influence in centenarians as in adults 20-70 years of age; however, ACE itself appears to be functionally similar for each genotype. Furthermore, the D allele as well as the higher serum ACE activities associated with the D/D genotype cannot discriminate individuals at high risk for cardiovascular diseases, major causes of mortality before the age of 100 years.

TI  - C-reactive protein as an outcome predictor for maintenance hemodialysis patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The possible association between inflammatory processes and other outcome measures in ESRD patients led us to measure the blood C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in a large sample of hemodialysis patients, and to evaluate its statistical relationship with other common laboratory measures and patient survival. This was performed in a prospective, observational analysis with mortality as the principal outcome measure. METHODS: One thousand fifty-four routine blood samples, collected from as many patients during June and July 1995 (one sample per patient), were randomly selected for measurement of CRP, prealbumin, and other routine laboratory measures. Six months after the initial blood tests, patient survival was determined: Logistic regression analysis was the primary statistical tool used to evaluate laboratory associations with odds of death. Bivariate regression and correlation analyses were performed using all available data. RESULTS: The distribution of CRP values was skewed; approximately 35% of the values exceeded the upper limit of the laboratory's reference range. Serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations both correlated with the serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.378 and r = 0.347, respectively; P's < 0.001), and were inversely associated with the CRP (r = -0.254 and r = -0.354, respectively; P's < 0.001). CRP was also inversely associated with blood hemoglobin concentrations (r = -0.235; P < 0.001). Using multiple regression analysis to further explore these relationships, the serum creatinine concentration was inversely associated with CRP (r = -0.140; P < 0.001). However, after adjustment for the linkage of the serum creatinine with the serum albumin concentration (r = -0.378; P < 0.001), no relationship with creatinine was observed. Before and after adjustment for serum albumin and prealbumin concentration, the ferritin concentration correlated directly with CRP (r = 0.148; P < 0.001). Ferritin was inversely and highly correlated with total iron binding capacity (r = -0.516; P < 0.001). Independent associations of hemoglobin with albumin (t = 7.16; P < 0.001), prealbumin (t = 2.39; P = 0.017), and CRP (t = -4.27; P < 0.001) were observed. Also, the dose of erythropoietin was directly associated with the CRP concentration, before (r = 0.081, P = 0.009) and after (t = 2.03, P = 0.042) adjustment for the serum albumin and iron concentrations. CRP correlated directly with neutrophil (r = 0.318; P < 0.001) and platelet counts (r = 0.180; P < 0.001), but was weakly and inversely correlated with the lymphocyte count (r = -0.071; P = 0.04). A logistic regression analysis performed using the laboratory variables revealed a strong, independent, and inverse relationships between the serum albumin and creatinine concentrations, total lymphocyte count, and the odds risk of death. In this model, no significant relationship was observed between the odds risk of death and CRP. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein suggest that: (1) strong predictable associations exist among laboratory proxies for malnutrition, anemia, and the acute phase reaction, and (2) the pathobiology implied by these laboratory abnormalities influence patients' mortal risk primarily through depletion of vital body proteins, not inflammation.

TI  - A new view on immune-adrenal interactions: role for Fas and Fas ligand?  
AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune system interact in a bidirectional manner providing the basis for the regulation of the immune response due to a pathogenic stimulus. This interplay is commonly believed to be based on the action of hormones or cytokines, respectively. Since it has been detected that adrenocortical cells offer immunological properties such as expression of MHC class II antigens and/or CD95 (Fas antigen) and its ligand, the question has to be raised whether direct intercellular communication between immune cells and 'immunocompetent' endocrine cells contributes to the complexity of immunoregulation. Here we discuss the possible reciprocal relevance of physiological and pathological adrenal changes, as well as T-cell-mediated immune response for immune and/or adrenal pathology during disease.

TI  - [The syndrome of depressive depersonalization]  
AB  - Nineteen patients (9 men, 10 women aged 22--38 years) with depressions were examined. The phenomena of anesthesia of ideatoric functions dominated in clinical picture of such depression. This depression is defined as the depression of estrangement. Psychopathologic differentiation of mental estrangement in the structure of depression and in similar disorders of self-consciousness which were formed in depressions under conditions of "transitional syndrome" (according to G.Gross) is outlined. This syndrome is characterised by irreversible negative disorders of "defective depersonalization". The following signs permit to distinguish depression of estrangement from "transitional syndrome": partiality of the estrangement's phenomenon; connection between psychopathologic formations and pathology of imagination (figurative expressiveness, demonstrativity, lability to psychogenic and medical actions); conformity of the syndrome's structure and characteristics of premanifested personality's structure (combination of hyperthymic features with histrionic and/or narcissic ones). "Apperceptive anesthesia" is suggested for designation of the variant of the depression described.

TI  - A logical coronal pattern classification of 2,000 consecutive idiopathic scoliosis cases based on the scoliosis research society-defined apical vertebra.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two thousand consecutive idiopathic scoliosis records and radiographs were reviewed for coronal pattern typing and categorization, based on Scoliosis Research Society definitions of the apical vertebra. Apical frequency was determined for each of the patterns identified, and represents a database from a large series of cases for the already accepted Scoliosis Research Society definitions. OBJECTIVES: To identify and numerically pattern-type a large series of idiopathic coronal curves, for the basic purpose of written and oral communication. Some pattern types were not described previously. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although spinal deformity must be considered three dimensional for treatment in 1998, no comprehensive, databased, and user friendly coronal or sagittal classification of idiopathic scoliosis has been reported. METHODS: Two thousand idiopathic curve patterns from charts and radiographs were reviewed and the coronal patterns categorized by the apical vertebra. The resulting classification was tested for inter- and intraobserver reliability by 12 spine surgeons and 6 orthopedic residents. Apical frequencies were determined for each pattern type. RESULTS: Twenty-one pattern categories were identified, and all were right or left mirror image patterns (except for a quadruple pattern) that permitted separation into 11 types. Incorporating the widely recognized five numbered King types mad pattern recognition simple. Interobserver reliability testing was 98.2%. The left single thoracic curve pattern was included in this classification because only 9 (20.4%) of 44 patients with left thoracic curves had intraspinal pathology. CONCLUSION: Two thousand consecutive idiopathic coronal curve patterns separated into eleven readily identifiable types, and incorporating the widely referenced five King types, makes recognition simple for purposes of identification and communication. Sagittal and 3D factors excluded from this classification are equally important in the process of treatment decisions. Apical frequency data determined in this study lends credence to Scoliosis Research Society definitions for idiopathic curve patterns.

TI  - Improved diagnostic accuracy of inferior petrosal sinus sampling over imaging for localizing pituitary pathology in patients with Cushing's disease.  
AB  - The majority of patients with Cushing's disease can be cured by transsphenoidal microsurgery; however, precise localization of the pituitary source of ACTH is not always possible by standard imaging techniques. Bilateral venous sampling from the inferior petrosal sinuses (IPSS) is also useful for diagnosing Cushing's disease, but the interpretation of discordant findings between IPSS and imaging remains problematic. We tested the ability of imaging and IPSS to localize an ACTH-secreting pituitary lesion in comparison to definitive histopathological examination of the pituitary in patients with Cushing's disease (n = 37). Bilateral IPS catheterization was technically feasible in 32 patients and provided evidence of lateralization in 31 patients. Histological examination confirmed a corticotropic adenoma in 28 patients and corticotropic hyperplasia in 2 patients; Crooke's hyaline change was found in 7 patients, among whom 1 subsequently was found to have an ectopic sphenoid corticotropic adenoma, and the remainder had suspected microadenomas that were not identified microscopically. Accurate localization of the pituitary lesion was more frequent when based on IPSS results than on imaging studies (70% vs. 49%, P < 0.06). The 2 tests provided directly discrepant results for 8 patients; among these, IPSS was more likely than imaging to agree with final pathology (63% vs. 13%, P < 0.10). Imaging was entirely normal for another 9 patients, in whom IPSS accurately localized the lesion for the majority (89%; 95% confidence interval: 50-99%). We suggest that IPSS is an effective tool for localizing pituitary pathology and planning surgery for patients with Cushing's disease.

TI  - Impact of mammographic screening on the size and the relative frequency of invasion in breast cancers seen in a community hospital from 1975-1988.  
AB  - At CPMC routine mammographic screening was introduced in late 1975. The total volume of breast cancers, other than outside consultations, seen in the department increased from 71 in 1975 to 164 by 1988, an increase of 230%. This expansion in volume was due largely to surgical removal of mammographically detected occult, in situ duct and relatively small invasive duct carcinomas. In 1974, prior to routine mammographic screening, in situ carcinomas represented only 4% of all breast cancers seen in the Department of Pathology at CPMC. However, after the introduction of mammographic screening, the proportion of in situ cancers increased steadily. By 1988, 45% of all breast cancers seen in our hospital were found by mammography. While data on the size distribution of invasive breast cancers are not available at our hospital prior to 1976, an appreciable effect of mammography is still evident when the numbers of relatively small invasive cancers detected in 1976 are compared with those detected in 1988. Invasive breast cancers 10 mm in diameter or less represented only 6% of all cancers in our series in 1976, but 33% in 1988. These findings confirm observations made by Gibbs on the pathology of breast cancers found in mammographically screened and unscreened populations. The detection of increasing numbers of relatively small invasive duct carcinomas produced an overall reduction in the average diameters of invasive cancers seen at CPMC. The average dropped from 30 mm in 1975 to a low of 14.8 mm in 1987. Mammography did not appear to be effective in the early detection of invasive lobular cancers and had no impact on reducing their size. The implications of early discovery of in situ duct and relatively small invasive duct carcinomas are for improved patient survival through: (1) preventing progression of in situ duct to invasive duct cancers, and (2) the removal of invasive duct cancers before reaching a size where there is a high risk of metastasis.

TI  - Problems with long-term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease.  
AB  - The introduction of levodopa 25 years ago revolutionized the management of Parkinson's disease. However, it soon became apparent that the drug offered only symptomatic relief and did not affect the underlying pathology. Moreover, chronic use of the drug was associated with a range of adverse effects. Current therapeutic strategies seek to delay long-term complications of treatment for as long as possible. However, once they appear, most adverse effects are amenable to some form of management. A number of therapeutic strategies are available for treatment of Parkinson's disease. The final choice of therapy depends on the individual circumstances and requirements of the patient and should balance tolerance for adverse effects with the amount of symptomatic relief required. Patients receiving long-term levodopa therapy must contend with some adverse effects. After 5 years the majority of these patients suffer fluctuations, dyskinesias, toxicity, or loss of efficacy. Fluctuations can be reduced by changing the drug regimen to a combination therapy of Sinemet and Sinemet controlled-release (CR), or by the addition of deprenyl or a dopamine agonist. Variations in gastric emptying and absorption of levodopa and dietary factors become important. Dyskinesias in long-term levodopa therapy are poorly understood and difficult to manage, although dopamine agonists can be of some use. As the disease progresses, new disabilities appear that are less responsive to levodopa, and its efficacy can appear to diminish, with increased doses often leading to toxicity.
