TI  - Role of angiotensin II in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway induced by acute pressure overload in the rat heart.  
AB  - This study was designed to determine whether the JAK/STAT (indicating just another kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is activated in cardiac hypertrophy induced in vivo by pressure overload in rats and to demonstrate whether angiotensin II is involved in the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Acute pressure overload was produced by constricting the abdominal aorta of Wistar rats. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis revealed that pressure overload activated JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 as early as 5 minutes and that STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 were tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly after exposure to the pressure overload. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 peaked in the early stage at 5 to 15 minutes, whereas that of STAT3 peaked in the late stage at 60 minutes. Gel mobility shift of the interferon gamma activation site/interferon alpha-stimulating response element was observed immediately after the aortic banding, whereas the band of sis-inducing element was shifted in the late stage at 60 minutes. Both cilazapril (angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor) and E4177 (angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor antagonist) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of Tyk2 and partially inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2, but neither affected JAK1. Coimmunoprecipitation of the AT1 receptor with JAK2 or Tyk2 was clearly observed at 5 minutes and peaked at 15 minutes (20-fold the control value). These results indicate that the JAK/STAT pathway is activated by acute pressure overload in rats and that angiotensin II is involved in activating Tyk2, and partially activating JAK2, via the AT1 receptor. Both angiotensin II-dependent and -independent pathways take part in activating the JAK/STAT pathway in the pressure-overloaded rat heart.

TI  - A physiologic in vitro model of the inferior vena cava with a computer-controlled flow system for testing of inferior vena cava filters.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors develop a physiologic in vitro model of the inferior vena cava (IVC) for testing of filters. METHODS: The model is driven by a centrifugal pump. A computer-controlled electromagnetic valve is used for generation of different flow patterns. Limitation of the pressure increase in case of IVC occlusion is achieved by a bypass circuit. A glycerin solution is used for perfusion. Artificial clots are made from polyacrylamide gel. Data acquisition includes continuous monitoring of flow and difference pressure over the filter and video recording of the testing events. RESULTS: The model can generate constant and pulsatile flows.  The pressure increase can be limited to 70 mm Hg in case of occlusion. Calculation of the flow velocities in the IVC is possible. A classification of thrombus capturing is presented. The testing of most of the results are reproducible. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro model simulates the physiologic conditions in the IVC. It can be used for comparative testing of different filters and the evaluation of new filter designs.

TI  - Cardiopulmonary physiology of primary blast injury.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bomb blast survivors are occasionally found in profound shock and hypoxic without external signs of injury. We investigated the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses of rats subjected to a blast pressure wave. DESIGN: Prospectively randomized, controlled animal study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were instrumented and subjected to a blast pressure wave of different intensities from a blast wave generator. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded for 3 hours or until death. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cardiovascular response to a blast pressure wave was immediate bradycardia, hypotension, and low cardiac index. Three hours later, the rats developed hypotension, low cardiac index, and low stroke volume. Interestingly, systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged. The pulmonary response was a decreased PaO2 and stable PacO2, suggesting a ventilation-perfusion mismatch from massive pulmonary hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Blast-induced circulatory shock resulted from immediate myocardial depression without a compensatory vasoconstriction. Hypoxia presumably resulted from a ventilation-perfusion mismatch caused by pulmonary hemorrhage.

TI  - [The efficacy of HFJV (high frequency jet ventilation) for ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome) following total arch replacement]  
AB  - A 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with shock due to acute aortic dissection (type A of Stanford classification). The emergent total arch replacement was performed with the retrograde cerebral perfusion uneventfully. At the 3rd day after the operation, bilateral infiltrates were recognized on the frontal chest radiograph. The oxygenation was gradually decreased to less than 200 mmHg of PaO2/FiO2 in proportion with the growth of infiltrates and increase of LDH in blood. Steroid therapy was not effective. So then HFJV was introduced to improvement of hypoxygenation at the 16th day after the operation. HFJV made PaO2/FiO2 improve immediately to more than 300 mmHg and the inspiratrory pressure decrease to less than 30 mmHg. Bilateral infiltrates were diminished by HFJV. LDH in blood decreased apparently. HFJV had been used together during 15 days. The respirator was weaned at the 46th day after the operation. In this clinical course, the change of PaO2/FiO2 had the negative correlation with that of LDH in blood.

TI  - Robotic solid-phase extraction of amphetamines from urine for analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  
AB  - We have evaluated the use of the Hamilton Microlab 2200 robotic pipetting system modified to conduct solid-phase extractions of amphetamines from urine. The Hamilton system is a programmable XYZ robotic sample handling instrument compatible with commercial solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns in the most commonly available sizes. During the extraction and elution steps, the system delivers programmable positive pressure with pressure controlled feedback so as to ensure consistent recovery. The system increases sample throughput while reducing technician hands-on time and improving sample-to-sample and batch-to-batch consistency. In comparison with the manual SPE method, the automated scheme provides similar analyte recovery, accuracy, and precision and a reduced potential for laboratory errors. The method's upper limits of linearity, detection, and lquantitation were, respectively, 10,000, 100, and 100 ng/mL for amphetamine and 25,000, 50, and 50 ng/mL for methamphetamine. Extraction recoveries for the compounds ranged from 88 to 101%. Carryover amounted to less than 0.02% even at 50,000 ng/mL concentrations of analyte. A typical automated run required 20 min of technician time versus 90 min for a corresponding manual SPE procedure. The automated procedure proved to be a reliable and labor-efficient addition to the laboratory.

TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of keratinocyte growth factor gene amplification and dispersion in evolution of great apes and humans.  
AB  - Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family. Portions of the gene encoding KGF were amplified during primate evolution and are present in multiple nonprocessed copies in the human genome. Nucleotide analysis of a representative sampling of these KGF-like sequences indicated that they were at least 95% identical to corresponding regions of the KGF gene. To localize these sequences to specific chromosomal sites in human and higher primates, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization. In human, using a cosmid probe encoding KGF exon 1, we assigned the location of the KGF gene to chromosome 15q15-21.1. In addition, copies of KGF-like sequences hybridizing only with a cosmid probe encoding exons 2 and 3 were localized to dispersed sites on chromosome 2q21, 9p11, 9q12-13, 18p11, 18q11, 21q11, and 21q21.1. The distribution of KGF-like sequences suggests a role for alphoid DNA in their amplification and dispersion. In chimpanzee, KGF-like sequences were observed at five chromosomal sites, which were each homologous to sites in human, while in gorilla, a subset of four of these homologous sites was identified; in orangutan two sites were identified, while gibbon exhibited only a single site. The chromosomal localization of KGF sequences in human and great ape genomes indicates that amplification and dispersion occurred in multiple discrete steps, with initial KGF gene duplication and dispersion taking place in gibbon and involving loci corresponding to human chromosomes 15 and 21. These findings support the concept of a closer evolutionary relationship of human and chimpanzee and a possible selective pressure for such dispersion during the evolution of higher primates.

TI  - A comparison of ultrasonographically detected cervical changes in response to transfundal pressure, coughing, and standing in predicting cervical incompetence.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare various noninvasive stress techniques for their ability to elicit ultrasonographic cervical changes and to determine their efficacy in detecting ultrasonographic cervical incompetence. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-nine patients at risk for pregnancy loss and preterm birth underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of the cervix at least twice between 15 and 24 weeks of gestation. With use of a transvaginal probe, the funnel width, funnel length, and endocervical canal length were measured in millimeters with the patient in the supine position. These measurements were repeated after three stress tests: transfundal pressure, coughing, and standing. The difference between the baseline measurements and those obtained after the stress tests were determined. A positive response to stress was defined as any decrease in endocervical canal length accompanied by an increase in funnel width and length. Improvement was defined by any increase in endocervical canal length accompanied by a decrease in funnel width and length. Cervical incompetence was defined as the presence of progressive cervical changes on ultrasonographic examinations with final endocervical canal length measurements below 26 mm. Results are reported as median (range). RESULTS: The number of positive cervical responses to transfundal pressure (19%, 17/89) was significantly greater than to coughing (3.3%, 3/89) and standing (9.0%, 8/89). The status of the cervix improved with standing in three cases, whereas this was not seen with transfundal pressure or coughing. There was no case where there was a positive response to standing or coughing and not to transfundal pressure. When the changes in funnel width and length and endocervical canal length as a result of transfundal pressure and standing in the 17 cases that responded to transfundal pressure, transfundal pressure resulted in a significantly greater increase in funnel width and length and a decrease in endocervical canal length. The efficacy of transfundal pressure in detecting the cervix that had subsequent progressive changes on ultrasonography was as follows: sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 97.2%, and positive and negative predictive values 88.2% and 95.8%, respectively. The efficacy of coughing was sensitivity 16.7%, specificity 100%, and positive and negative predictive values 100% and 85.5%, respectively. The efficacy of standing was sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 97.2%, and positive and negative predictive values 75% and 85.2%, respectively. Similar results were obtained when the analysis was confined to 37 patients who had a prior history of a midtrimester miscarriage. CONCLUSION: Transfundal pressure was the most effective technique in eliciting cervical changes during the active assessment of the cervix during pregnancy and the most sensitive in detecting the cervix that had progressive second-trimester cervical shortening during pregnancy, compared with coughing or standing position.

AB  - Many patients can be sitting in a chair for between 3 and 14 hours each day, consequently the type of cushion they are sitting on is of the utmost importance. These patients are often at high risk of developing pressure sores--possibly more so than bed-bound patients. Vicair, whose UK distributor is Gerald Simonds Healthcare, has developed two types of pressure-reducing cushions: the Vicair Academy and Liberty Fluid-Air.  These cushions offer pressure reduction in a system that is user-friendly and particularly lightweight. This product focus highlights the problems associated with seating and explains how the Vicair range of cushions attempts to address them.

TI  - [Evaluation of respiratory muscle strength in patients with interstitial lung changes based on simultaneous measurement of esophageal and mouth pressure]  
AB  - A well know good relation between nasal and oesophageal inspiratory pressures exists in healthy and in COPD patients "sniff manoeuvres. Similar results are obtained using "gasp" maneuvers. The aim of the study was to appreciate the usefulness of "gasp" for evaluation of inspiratory muscles strength in ILD patients. 18 ILD patients were examined: group A consisted of 9 pts (8M+IF) aged 35 +/- 8.6 yrs, with static compliance > 70% pred. (mean 98.6 +/- 16.3), group B consisted of 9 pts (6M + 3F) (aged 52 +/- 13.0) with static compliance < 70% pred. (mean 37.2 +/- 12.0), Pmo and Poe (Milic-Emili method) were measured simultaneously during breathing with Pflex device (1.7 mm diameter). Results were stored in a computer for further analysis. In all patients spirometry, plethysmography and maximal inspiratory (MIP) and maximal expiratory (MEP) pressure measurements were performed. Poe and Pmo in group A were nearly the same (8.16 +/- 1.82 vs. 8.35 +/- 2.74 kPa), but in the group B Pmo was lower than Poe (4.81 +/- 1.59 vs. 6.19 +/- 2.03 kPa; p < 0.0005). We conclude that "gasp" - Pmo is a useful method for inspiratory muscle strength measurement only in ILD patients with normal static compliance but in ILD patients with decreased compliance "gasp" - Poe measurement in necessary.

TI  - Adrenergic control of the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exercise-induced enhancement of the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relations has been studied in conscious animals but not in intact diseased human hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated left ventricular (LV) isovolumic contraction (dP/dt(max)) and relaxation (tau) during atrial pacing and dynamic exercise in 13 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 7 control subjects to investigate the influence of exercise on the force-frequency and relaxation-frequency relations. Group A consisted of 6 patients in whom the heart rate (HR)-dP/dt(max) relation was markedly enhanced during exercise (88+/-30%) compared with during pacing (34+/-15%). Group B consisted of 7 patients in whom the HR-dP/dt(max) relation showed similar enhancement during exercise (28+/-7%) and atrial pacing (28+/-11%). There was no difference in the HR-tau (derivative method [TD] and pressure half-time method [T(1/2)]) relation between pacing and exercise in groups A and B. Both the mean maximal wall thickness and the hypertrophy score in group B were greater than in group A (27+/-5 versus 19+/-2 mm and 7+/-1 versus 5+/-1 points, respectively; both P<.01). There was no difference in the LV peak systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure, or the plasma level of catecholamines at baseline, at 50 W of exercise, and at peak pacing between groups A and B. The HR-dP/dt(max) relation in the control group was markedly enhanced during exercise (80+/-27%) compared with during pacing (32+/-14%). The HR-tau relation in the control group was enhanced during exercise (TD, 35+/-9%; T(1/2), 34+/-8%) compared with during pacing (TD, 12+/-7%; T(1/2), 14+/-7%). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced enhancement of the relaxation-frequency relation was inhibited in all HCM patients, regardless of the degree of LV hypertrophy. The patients without exercise-induced enhancement of the force-frequency relation had more severe LV hypertrophy than the patients with the enhancement, indicating that the adrenergic control of the force-frequency relation may, at least in part, depend on the severity of LV hypertrophy or the stage of HCM.

TI  - Effects of drugs on uteroplacental blood flow and the health of the foetus.  
AB  - 1. The placental vascular bed is normally fully dilated. Therefore, changes in vascular resistance elsewhere in the body can affect uteroplacental blood flow (UBF). For example, antihypertensive drugs, such as diazoxide, hydralazine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, cause falls in arterial pressure and, hence, in UBF. 2. Angiotensin II (AngII), prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) all influence uteroplacental vascular tone. Angiotensin II in a pharmacological dose (62.5 micrograms/h) had a biphasic effect on UBF in the sheep. Initially, there was a rise in UBF as pressure rose; however, by 16-24 h, UBF had fallen. The AngII-induced fall in UBF caused severe foetal hypoxia and hypercapnia. 3. Prostacyclin may protect the uteroplacental circulation from vasoconstrictors such as AngII, as the vasoconstrictor effect of AngII in the uteroplacental circulation is enhanced following indomethacin. 4. Oestrogen-induced uterine artery vasodilation is nitrergic dependent. As well, nitrergic nerves alter the responsiveness of pregnant uterine arteries to noradrenaline. 5. Thus, both systemic and local factors are important in the control of UBF and in promoting foetal health and growth.

TI  - Microtubule stabilization in pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy.  
AB  - Increased microtubule density, for which microtubule stabilization is one potential mechanism, causes contractile dysfunction in cardiac hypertrophy. After microtubule assembly, alpha-tubulin undergoes two, likely sequential, time-dependent posttranslational changes: reversible carboxy-terminal detyrosination (Tyr-tubulin left and right arrow Glu-tubulin) and then irreversible deglutamination (Glu-tubulin --> Delta2-tubulin), such that Glu- and Delta2-tubulin are markers for long-lived, stable microtubules. Therefore, we generated antibodies for Tyr-, Glu-, and Delta2-tubulin and used them for staining of right and left ventricular cardiocytes from control cats and cats with right ventricular hypertrophy. Tyr- tubulin microtubule staining was equal in right and left ventricular cardiocytes of control cats, but Glu-tubulin and Delta2-tubulin staining were insignificant, i.e., the microtubules were labile. However, Glu- and Delta2-tubulin were conspicuous in microtubules of right ventricular cardiocytes from pressure overloaded cats, i.e., the microtubules were stable. This finding was confirmed in terms of increased microtubule drug and cold stability in the hypertrophied cells. In further studies, we found an increase in a microtubule binding protein, microtubule-associated protein 4, on both mRNA and protein levels in pressure-hypertrophied myocardium. Thus, microtubule stabilization, likely facilitated by binding of a microtubule-associated protein, may be a mechanism for the increased microtubule density characteristic of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy.

TI  - Modeling obstetric cardiovascular physiology on a full-scale patient simulator.  
AB  - To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at adapting an existing cardiovascular model to simulate the hemodynamics of a particular patient population. Despite attempts to define the physiologic alterations in advance, we discovered there were critical parameters not completely defined in the literature. These were discovered through the iterative process of testing, comparing resulting vital signs with targets, and literature review. A list of the parameters that should be sought for future modeling efforts is provided (Table 3), but this list is by no means exhaustive. As further work is performed in this area, additional independent and essential parameters will be identified (pressure characteristics of valvular anomalies, for example). To define a physiology that is less well described in the literature, empirical alterations and best-guess estimates of parameter changes will be required with significantly more iterations. Finally, we have described only modeling of cardiovascular physiology, modeling the respiratory system will require a similar process.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the best regulation of air volume to be inflated into cuffs of different endotracheal canula diameters of high residual volume and low pressure. Maintaining the pressure exercised by a balloon in the trachea mucous membrane between preconized limits of 20 to 30 mmHg (less than the trachea capillary pressure). Therefore, 10 ml of air have been inflated into the canular cuff of intubed patients with different internal diameters (7.0-7.5- 8.0-8.5-9.0) one by one, measuring each millilitre of inflated air, the corresponding to pressure of the cuff in the trachea mucous membrane. The monitoring of the pressure has been made by a previously calibrated manometer. The procedure has been performed in 25 adult patients of both sexes, grouped in numbers of 5 for each internal tube diameter. The results have been analysed through linear regression analysis which has shown a close relationship between ml of inflated air and pressure in the cuff by tube diameter. After analysing the results, the author indicated, by means of graphic representation, the quantity of air to be inflated in the cuff and respective exercised pressure on the trachea mucous membrane, by tube meter, in a way to offer a contribution to the staff who provides assistance to intubed patients, in the sense of minimising the possible injuries and complications and assure a better respiratory ventilation.

AB  - The authors investigated 163 CarboMedics bileaflet prosthetic valves--81 mitral prostheses (MP), and 82 aortic prostheses (AP)--to determine acceptable pressure gradients across normally functioning prostheses and effective mitral valve orifice (MVO) area by Doppler echocardiography. In MP, the mean gradient was 3.6+/-1.7 mm Hg, peak transmitral gradient was 8.7+/-3.7 mm Hg, and mean effective valve area was 2.3+/-0.7 cm2. There was a significant overlap in mean and peak transaortic gradients even with valves of the same size. In AP, the mean gradient was 14.7+/-5.1 mm Hg and peak pressure gradient was 26.1+/-8.2 mm Hg. They observed a weak inverse correlation between valve size and gradients in AP. Mean and peak pressure gradients tended to be higher with smaller valve sizes, but differences were statistically significant (P < 0.5) only when they compared the smallest vs the largest valves. Trivial to mild regurgitation was detected in 28.4% of MP and 54.8% of AP. From the data they conclude that CarboMedics valves offer relatively little resistance to forward flow, both in the mitral and aortic positions, and their hemodynamic profile is comparable to that of the St. Jude bileaflet valves described in published literature.

TI  - Medical practitioners' views on the management of hypertension in Trinidad and Tobago.  
AB  - We surveyed 161 medical practitioners in Trinidad and Tobago (124 reporting private sector practice and 37 describing government health centre practice) for their views on blood pressure (BP) management. 96% of the respondents agreed that BP should be measured on all adults seen and 90% agreed that diastolic pressure should be recorded as the disappearance of sounds. There was disagreement over the level of diastolic BP at which drug treatment should be initiated: 63% would treat diastolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, but 35% would only treat diastolic BP of 110 mm Hg or higher. In private practice 31% preferred angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as treatment for an African Caribbean man with diastolic BP 110 mm Hg, but in public clinics 41% preferred thiazide diuretics. ACE inhibitors were most often preferred as treatment for an Indo-Caribbean man with diabetes and diastolic BP 110 mm Hg in both public and private practice. Doctors considered that noncompliance (66%), lack of education (34%) and unhealthy lifestyles (25%) were important obstacles to BP control. In private practice doctors considered patients' financial constraints to be an obstacle (58%), whereas in the public sector limited availability of drugs (57%) was felt to be more important. Less costly and, possibly, more appropriate drugs were used in public clinics.

We developed and used a 2-dimensional mathematical model for LDM to investigate how the size of pneumatic balloons (30, 38, and 45 ml) and the three different locations (proximal, center, and distal) affect the pressure applied to the balloon by LDM. The computer simulation was performed by coding a visco-elastic and nonlinear 2-dimensional program that employed the finite element method (FEM). The muscle specific parameters of LDM were obtained from animal experiment results. The model is based on Hill's characteristic equation and composed of a contractile component and a passive element. The simulation results indicated that the intermediate and largest sized balloon lead to the highest and the lowest power (volume reduction per unit time interval), respectively. On the other hand, when the balloon is inserted in the distal LDM, the power is lower than in the other two positions, regardless of the balloon size. The above results suggest that the optimal size of the balloon should be selected depending on the muscle specific parameters of the actuator, and that the balloon should be inserted either in the proximal portion or center of the actuator.

TI  - Estimating phonation threshold pressure.  
AB  - Phonation threshold pressure (PTP) is the minimum subglottal pressure required to initiate vocal fold oscillation. Although potentially useful clinically, PTP is difficult to estimate noninvasively because of limitations to vocal motor control near the threshold of soft phonation. Previous investigators observed, for example, that trained subjects were unable to produce flat, consistent oral pressure peaks during/pae/syllable strings when they attempted to phonate as softly as possible (Verdolini-Marston, Titze, & Druker, 1990). The present study aimed to determine if nasal airflow or vowel context affected phonation threshold pressure as estimated from oral pressure (Smitheran & Hixon, 1981) in 5 untrained female speakers with normal velopharyngeal and voice function. Nasal airflow during /p/occlusion was observed for 3 of 5 participants when they attempted to phonate near threshold pressure. When the nose was occluded, nasal airflow was reduced or eliminated during /p/;however, individuals then evidenced compensatory changes in glottal adduction and/or respiratory effort that may be expected to alter PTP estimates. Results demonstrate the importance of monitoring nasal flow (or the flow zero point in undivided masks) when obtaining PTP measurements noninvasively. Results also highlight the need to pursue improved methods for noninvasive estimation of PTP.

TI  - The Charcot-Marie-Tooth binary repeat contains a gene transcribed from the opposite strand of a partially duplicated region of the COX10 gene.  
AB  - Misalignment between the two elements of the CMT1A-REP binary repeat on chromosome 17p11.2-p12 causes two inherited peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. This binary repeat contains repetitive DNA elements that include LINES, SINES, medium reiteration frequency repeats, and a transposon-like element. The COX10 gene has been mapped 10 kb centromeric to the distal CMT1A-REP element, and a portion of this gene is present in both the proximal and the distal CMT1A-REP elements. We report the isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA (C170RF1), which maps centromeric to and partially within the proximal CMT1A-REP element. Part of C170RF1 is transcribed from the opposite strand of the COX10 partial gene duplication present in the proximal CMT1A-REP element. This finding shows that C170RF1 and COX10 are being transcribed from opposite strands of identical DNA sequences that are separated by 1.5 Mb in the genome. RT-PCR analysis showed the proximal transcript was expressed in skeletal muscle. Sequence analysis identified an open reading frame encoding a 199-amino-acid protein. Zoo blot analysis showed that the transcript is conserved in nonhuman primates. The presence of a binary repeat contributes to the instability of this region of chromosome 17, yet two CMT1A-REP elements are present in the chimpanzee and all human populations. The presence of expressed sequences in both elements of the CMT1A-REP binary repeat could explain the maintenance of this repeat in humans.

TI  - The vascular pole of the renal glomerulus of rat.  
AB  - In the present study we provide a detailed structural analysis of the vascular pole of superficial and midcortical glomeruli of the rat kidney. A description of the juxtaglomerular portions of the afferent and efferent arterioles, the extraglomerular mesangium and the glomerular stalk is included. The specific structural elaboration of the epithelial transition from the podocytes to the parietal epithelium is emphasized, with particular attention to the arrangement of the cytoskeleton and its connections to extracellular matrix elements. The branching patterns of the afferent and efferent arterioles are quite different. Immediately at the glomerular entrance, the afferent arteriole divides into its primary branches. In contrast, the efferent arteriole has a specific outflow segment (consisting of an intraglomerular portion and a portion associated with the extraglomerular mesangium) established by the confluence of capillary tributaries deep inside the glomerular tuft. Just at the transition from inside to outside, this segment includes a prominent narrow portion with conspicuous endothelial cells bulging into the vessel lumen. The extraglomerular mesangium has been found to represent a solid block of cells and matrix filling the space between the macula densa and both arterioles and extending into the entrance funnel. Peripherally located extraglomerular mesangial cells attach to the outer aspect of the parietal basement membrane. As a whole, the extraglomerular mesangium occludes the glomerular tuft. The results appear relevant with respect to four major aspects: (1) a support function counteracting the expansile forces resulting from the high intraglomerular pressures, (2) a direct functional influence of the afferent on the efferent arteriole, resulting from their narrow assemblage at the glomerular entrance, (3) a specific shear stress receptor function of the intraglomerular segment of the efferent arteriole, and (4) fluid leakage from the glomerular tuft through the stalk and the extraglomerular mesangium into the cortical interstitium. 1. The glomerulus is a high-pressure compartment; expansile forces continuously tend to expand glomerular capillaries, the glomerular stalk, and the glomerular entrance. Counteracting centripetal forces at the vascular pole appear to be developed as circular forces by the cytoskeleton of podocytes and parietal cells surrounding the glomerular entrance and as interconnecting forces between both arterioles and between opposing walls of the glomerular entrance, as well as of the glomerular stalk. These interconnecting forces are developed by the extraglomerular mesangium which--as a whole--forms a spiderlike closure device holding the glomerular entrance together. In addition, the extraglomerular mesangium develops occluding forces, allowing a gradual pressure drop between the glomerular stalk and the macula densa. 2. At the glomerular entrance, the outflow segment of the efferent arteriole is narrowly associated with the bifurcation of the afferent arteriole. Both are enclosed together in a common compartment surrounded by the glomerular basement membrane; there is no pressure barrier individually encompassing each vessel. Therefore, it may readily be suggested that the hydrostatic pressure of the afferent arteriole acts on the efferent arteriole. As a consequence, the luminal width of the efferent arteriole at this site, i.e., its resistance, may be directly modified by the pressure in the afferent arteriole. 3. The efferent arteriole at the transition of the intraglomerular segment to the segment that passes through the extraglomerular mesangium has a conspicuously narrow portion with endothelial cells protruding into th

TI  - The effect of sarcoplasmic reticulum blockade on the force/frequency relationship and systolic contraction patterns in the newborn pig heart.  
AB  - We investigated the relationship between heart rate and contractility in seven anaesthetized young piglets by measuring contractility at different atrial pacing rates. To study the origin of this relationship we repeated the measurements after blocking the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel with ryanodine. We assessed contractility using indices derived from instantaneous left ventricular pressure and volume measured by micromanometric and conductance catheters during rapid inferior vena cava occlusion, thus generating the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, which was characterized by its slope Ees, and the maximum rate of change of ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax)/end-diastolic volume relationship, also characterized by its slope. All animals showed an increase in contractility with increasing heart rate (intact force/frequency relationship) which was abolished after ryanodine. The most striking effect of ryanodine on baseline haemodynamics was the dramatic decrease of dP/dtmax to about 50% of its original value, while peak developed pressure and Ees did not change. We conclude that the young piglet, despite its immaturity, has a functional sarcoplasmic reticulum, illustrated by an intact force/frequency relationship. In addition, blockade of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in vivo has profoundly different effects during early and late systole, indicating that indices of contractility derived during different parts of the cardiac cycle represent different aspects of systole.

TI  - A comparison of gasless mechanical and conventional carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum methods for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation with increased intraabdominal pressure (IAP) has adverse hemodynamic, pulmonary, and renal effects. To avoid these problems, an abdominal wall lift method with a retractor was used to provide the surgical view without CO2 insufflation. Twenty-six patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to either the gasless, retractor group, or conventional CO2 pneumoperitoneum group (CPP). Hemodynamic data, ventilatory variables, urine output, urine oxygen tension, and blood samples for determining stress hormones were collected throughout the perioperative period. Patients in the retractor group had lower mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure (P < 0.001). They also had higher pulmonary dynamic compliance and needed a lower minute volume of ventilation to achieve normocarbia (P < 0.001). Urine output and oxygen tension in urine were higher (P < 0.05) with the retractor method than with CPP. Increase in plasma renin activity (P < 0.05) and decrease in core temperature (P < 0.001) were smaller with the gasless method than with CPP. The gasless method for laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be beneficial, especially in patients with compromised cardiorespiratory or renal function. Implications: Totally gasless laparoscopic cholecystectomy was compared with conventional pressure pneumoperitoneum with CO2 insufflation. The gasless method resulted in more stable hemodynamics and pulmonary function, as well as higher urine, output than conventional pressure pneumoperitoneum. No changes in renal oxygenation was seen with the gasless method, compared with conventional pressure pneumoperitoneum.

TI  - Studies on the vasoconstrictor action of melatonin and putative melatonin receptor ligands in the tail artery of juvenile Wistar rats.  
AB  - 1. In this study we compared the vasoconstrictor activity of melatonin in rat isolated tail artery using two different recording systems, the Halpern pressure myograph and the Halpern-Mulvany wire myograph, with the view to determining a reliable method for obtaining pharmacological data on vascular melatonin receptors. In addition, we characterized the melatonin receptor in this preparation, using analogues of melatonin, and examined the activity of various naphthalenic derivatives with biological activity in non-vascular models of melatonin receptors. 2.  Using the Halpern pressure myograph, cumulative addition of melatonin (0.1 nM to 1 microM) produced direct vasoconstriction (19.3+/-6.4% reduction in lumen diameter, n=5) in five of 11 pressurized segments, with pEC50 of 9.14+/-0.17. Similarly, non-cumulative application of melatonin caused vasoconstriction (19.7+/-4.6% reduction in lumen diameter, n=7) in seven of 20 preparations examined with pEC50 of 8.74+/-0.26. The selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, UK-14304 (5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline bitartrate), produced vasoconstriction in all 'melatonin-insensitive' preparations. 3. Melatonin (0.1 nM to 1 microM) failed to elicit isometric contractions of tail artery segments in the Halpern wire myograph, but produced concentration-dependent potentiation of electrically-evoked, isometric contractions (maximum effect of 150-200% enhancement) when applied either noncumulatively (seven of seven preparations) or cumulatively (four of seven preparations). The pEC50 value of melatonin (non-cumulative) was 8.50+/-0.10 (n=7) which was not different from that obtained in the pressure myograph. All further experiments were conducted using a non-cumulative protocol against electrically-evoked, isometric contractions. 4. Based on the pEC50 values for the melatonin analogues examined, the pharmacological profile for the enhancement of electrically-evoked contractions was 2-iodomelatonin > 6-chloromelatonin > or = (-)-AMMTC > or = S21634 > or = melatonin > or = S20098 > S20242 > or = S20304 > 6-hydroxymelatonin > S20932 > (+)-AMMTC > N-acetyl-5-HT. Our data suggests the vascular receptor belongs to the MEL1-like subtype. All the indole-based analogues of melatonin, 2-iodomelatonin, (-)-AMMTC, (+)-AMMTC, S20932, 6-chloromelatonin, 6-hydroxymelatonin and N-acetyl-5-HT, behaved as full agonists. All the naphthalenic derivatives examined, S21634, S20098, S20242 and S20304 behaved as partial agonists relative to melatonin. 5. The naphthalenic-based antagonists, S20928 and S20929, did not modify electrically-evoked, isometric contractions of the tail artery, but produced a parallel, rightward displacement of the melatonin concentration-response curve. Based upon the effect of 1 microM S20928 and S20929, the estimated pK(B) values for these antagonists were 7.18+/-0.25 (n=4) and 7.17+/-0.25 (n=5), respectively. 6. We demonstrated that enhancement of electrically-evoked, isometric contractions of the rat isolated tail artery (using the Halpern-Mulvany wire myograph) is a simple and reproducible model for assessing the activity of putative agonists, partial agonists and antagonists at vascular melatonin receptors. Pharmacological characterization of the receptor suggests the presence of a MEL1-like subtype.

TI  - Pulmonary blood volume and its effects on pressure/flow relations and flow resistance in isolated lungs of rabbits.  
AB  - Quantitative information about the effects of pulmonary blood volume (Qp) on pulmonary haemodynamics is lacking since Qp changes inevitably with flow. To separate flow-dependent from volume-dependent changes in intravascular pressures we imposed changes in Qp (measured continuously) by altering outflow pressure in seven isolated, blood-perfused rabbit lungs and studied the effects of Qp on the relations between arteriovenous pressure gradient (DeltaP) and blood flow (Q.) under two conditions: flow-dependent volume changes were either permitted or compensated. In the latter circumstances, DeltaP changed more for a given change in Q.. The DeltaP/Q. relations were shifted to smaller DeltaP when Qp was increased. Hence, the calculated flow resistance (R = DeltaP/Q.) decreased with increasing Qp at a given Q.. Assuming constant viscosity, changes in R can be predicted from changes in vessel geometry and thus Qp. We found that R increased less than expected (by a factor of 3-7.5 instead of 9) when Qp was reduced to one-third. This discrepancy may be explained by a change in blood distribution within the lung despite constant Qp and by a change in apparent blood viscosity with Q.. Regardless of these speculations we have shown that Qp determines DeltaP at each flow and thus flow resistance.

AB  - The cardiovascular effects of dipotassium (Z)-2-[[5-ethyl-3-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl] methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazoline-2-ylidene]aminocarbonyl]-1-cyc lopentencarboxylate CAS 169328-25-0, KRH-594), a new angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, on pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy in rats and on acute left ventricular failure in dogs were investigated. In rats with a 2-week abdominal aorta constriction, left ventricular weight (LVW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were significantly greater than in sham-operated rats. Oral administration of KRH-594 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced the increases in both LVW and SBP. Another AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan cilexetil (1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks), also prevented this type of cardiac hypertrophy. In anesthetized dogs with a 60-min coronary ligation, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were raised, whereas the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure and cardiac output were both decreased. Intravenous administration of KRH-594 (3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increases in both LVEDP and TPR after coronary ligation. These results suggest that KRH-594, by reducing the cardiac afterload, may ameliorate pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy in rats and produce an improvement in the hemodynamic status of dogs with acute left ventricular failure.

We found that 1) for a given inspiratory time the integrated diaphragm EMG (Di) was similar or reduced in REM sleep relative to NREM sleep; 2) for a given Di in response to airway occlusion and the hyperpnea following occlusion, the mechanical output (flow or pressure) was similar or reduced during REM sleep relative to NREM sleep; 3) for comparable durations of airway occlusion the Di and integrated inspiratory tracheal pressure tended to be smaller and more variable in REM than in NREM sleep, and 4) significant fractionations (caused visible changes in tracheal pressure) of the diaphragm EMG during airway occlusion in REM sleep occurred in approximately 40% of breathing efforts.

TI  - Neural-mechanical coupling of breathing in REM sleep.  
AB  - During rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep the ventilatory response to airway occlusion is reduced. Possible mechanisms are reduced chemosensitivity, mechanical impairment of the chest wall secondary to the atonia of REM sleep, or phasic REM events that interrupt or fractionate ongoing diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) activity. To differentiate between these possibilities, we studied three chronically instrumented dogs before, during, and after 15-20 s of airway occlusion during non-REM (NREM) and phasic REM sleep. We found that 1) for a given inspiratory time the integrated diaphragm EMG (Di) was similar or reduced in REM sleep relative to NREM sleep; 2) for a given Di in response to airway occlusion and the hyperpnea following occlusion, the mechanical output (flow or pressure) was similar or reduced during REM sleep relative to NREM sleep; 3) for comparable durations of airway occlusion the Di and integrated inspiratory tracheal pressure tended to be smaller and more variable in REM than in NREM sleep, and 4) significant fractionations (caused visible changes in tracheal pressure) of the diaphragm EMG during airway occlusion in REM sleep occurred in approximately 40% of breathing efforts. Thus reduced and/or erratic mechanical output during and after airway occlusion in REM sleep in terms of flow rate, tidal volume, and/or pressure generation is attributable largely to reduced neural activity of the diaphragm, which in turn is likely attributable to REM effects, causing reduced chemosensitivity at the level of the peripheral chemoreceptors or, more likely, at the central integrator. Chest wall distortion secondary to the atonia of REM sleep may contribute to the reduced mechanical output following airway occlusion when ventilatory drive is highest.

TI  - [Taurine as a regulator of fluid-electrolyte balance and arterial pressure]  
AB  - Taurine is a sulfonic beta-amino acid which occurs in the highest concentration in the brain, the retina and in the myocardium. In cardiomyocytes it presents about 50% of free amino acids and plays a role as an osmoregulator, an inotropic factor and has an antiarrhythmic property. Moreover, taurine lowers arterial pressure by extension of diuresis and by vasodilatation. Similar effect on the vascular system and arterial pressure is exerted by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increase of both ANP secretion and myocardial taurine concentration is present in the same diseases as congestive cardiac failure, hypertension and hypernatremia. The aim of the study was the evaluation of general taurine depletion, caused by making the rats drink guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES)--an inhibitor of taurine transport affecting fluid balance and arterial pressure as well as plasma ANP concentration under normal conditions and after increase of sodium load. The 103 male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used. The animals were separated into 5 groups. Control group received tap water to drink. Group II was sodium-loaded by drinking 171 mmol/l NaCl. In group III depletion of taurine was obtained by the intake of 60 mmol/l GES. Rats in group IV were drinking 60 mmol/l GES in 171 mmol/l NaCl. Group V was made to drink 200 mmol/l taurine in 171 mmol/l NaCl. All animals had standard food and were able at any time to drink. Duration of the experiment was 20 days. At the onset and after 10 and 20 days the rats were weighed and their systolic blood pressure was measured by tail plethysmography. After 10 and 20 days of the study, plasma and myocardium taurine concentration, ANP, hematocrit, plasma osmolity, natremia, kalemia, urea and creatinine concentrations were determined. Taking GES for 20 days led to 43% decrease of plasma taurine and its myocardium content about 50% as compared to control group (Tab. 2). High, statistically significant correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) between myocardium taurine and plasma ANP was found. The animals with taurine depletion had significantly lower (about 30%) plasma ANP concentration (Tab. 3), higher natremia (Tab. 4) and their arterial pressure increased due to sodium load.  Systolic pressure was 11 mm Hg higher in that group in comparison to control and other groups (Tab. 1). However, the sodium-loading of the rats that drank taurine solution led to an increase of hematocrit, plasma osmolity, urea concentration and body mass gain as compared to control group, but without any arterial pressure increase. The sodium-loaded rats with normal plasma and myocardium taurine concentration were affected in a similar manner. The rats with higher myocardium taurine concentration had lower heart mass index. Results of this work lead to the following conclusions: 1. Depletion of taurine in hearts of examined rats leads to a decrease of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration in plasma. 2. ANP secretion caused by salt loading is lower in animals with taurine depletion than in normal animals. 3. Sodium-loading of animals with taurine depletion leads to hypernatremia and to an increase of arterial pressure. 4. Addition of taurine to animals loaded with sodium may lead to their dehydration.

TI  - Intramuscular partial oxygen tension monitoring in compartment syndrome--an experimental study.  
AB  - Measuring intracompartmental pressure is a well-accepted method in evaluating a compartment syndrome, which may occur after limb ischaemia followed by reperfusion. As a compartment syndrome is paralleled by a decreased microcirculation it should be possible also to evaluate a compartment syndrome by measuring intramuscular partial oxygen tension (PO2). In this study, anaesthetized rats (spontaneous breathing via tracheotomy) were subjected to infrarenal ligation of the aorta.  A pressure catheter was placed subfascial in the crural muscle group of one hind limb, whereas the contralateral side was prepared with a PO2 catheter. Besides a sham operated group, three experimental groups were subjected to either 2, 4 or 6 h of ischaemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion. One further group was also subjected to 4 h of ischaemia and 4 h of reperfusion but received a fasciotomy at the time of reperfusion. Compartment pressure and intramuscular PO2 were recorded every 15 min. For histological examination muscle specimens were obtained after each experiment. Two hours of ischaemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion did not result in any morphological changes and also in no significant change in compartment pressure during both phases, whereas PO2 significantly dropped during ischaemia (from 19.0 mmHg to 3.0-5.0 mmHg) and returned to normal during reperfusion. In prolonged ischaemia (4 h) morphologically a severe interstitial oedema was evident, compartment pressure increased during reperfusion (from 2.0 mmHg to 8.8 mmHg) and PO2 dropped during ischaemia to 3.0 mmHg and did not return to normal during reperfusion (10.5 mmHg versus 19.0 mmHg normal). In the case of 6 h ischaemia, partial necrosis and no interstitial oedema was found morphologically. There was no significant change in compartment pressure throughout the study, and PO2 remained significantly decreased even during reperfusion (2.0-3.0 mmHg). Normal compartment pressure could mislead to false negative interpretation of microcirculatory disorders preceding or following compartment syndrome, whereas PO2 clearly identifies the microcirculatory state of the muscle. Thus, intramuscular PO2 monitoring presents a valuable method in evaluating compartment syndrome, especially where there are suspected clinical signs and risk of ischaemia but normal compartment pressure.

Normal compartment pressure could mislead to false negative interpretation of microcirculatory disorders preceding or following compartment syndrome, whereas PO2 clearly identifies the microcirculatory state of the muscle. Thus, intramuscular PO2 monitoring presents a valuable method in evaluating compartment syndrome, especially where there are suspected clinical signs and risk of ischaemia but normal compartment pressure.

TI  - Sources of inaccuracy in the use of the Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify possible causes of inaccuracy in the use of the Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer and methods that could reduce this. METHODS: Four Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometers were compared with a standard sphygmomanometer under static conditions. Two methods (standard and rapid) were used to release pressure from the inflated cuff with pressures recorded by independent blinded observers. The rate at which the hand valve released pressure was analysed. The effects of varying filling times and pressures on the size of the final zero correction were investigated. RESULTS: The Hawksley devices all under-recorded pressure compared with that measured by using a standard machine. A rapid means of pressure release approximately halved this error in each case. Pressure release through the hand valve was shown to have a characteristic and prolonged exponential decay. Using low filling times and pressures reduced the observed range of zeros seen, with the production of a correlation between the size of the zero and the inflation pressure used. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that overestimation of the final zero correction is a common and major source of error in the use of the Hawksley sphygmomanometer. A simple change in the design of the final pressure release would improve the machine's reliability in clinical usage. The machine's zero mechanism is susceptible to unintentional misuse. Such misuse could occur when the machine is used in accordance with current sphygmomanometry guidelines.

TI  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome: MR imaging at 0.1 T compared with tissue pressure measurement [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare low-field-strength magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with intracompartmental tissue pressure measurement for the diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients suspected clinically of having chronic exertional compartment syndrome in the anterior tibial compartment were studied. MR imaging at 0.1-T and intracompartmental tissue pressure measurements of the anterior tibial compartment were performed before and immediately after standard treadmill exercise. The MR measurements were also obtained in eight anterior tibial compartments of four control subjects without the syndrome. Intracompartmental signal intensity was normalized with the signal intensity from lower leg tissues not affected by the compartment syndrome (subcutaneous fat, tibial bone marrow, or superficial posterior compartment). RESULTS: In the patient group, the relative change from rest to the postexercise state in the normalized MR signal intensity parameter correlated significantly (P < .001) with the respective change in intracompartmental pressure and with the absolute postexercise pressure. In the patients with elevated postexercise intracompartmental pressure, the increase in normalized MR signal intensity from rest to the postexercise state was significantly greater (P < .01) than that in the control subjects or the patients with normal or borderline postexercise intracompartmental pressure. In the latter two groups, the MR results were comparable. CONCLUSION: MR imaging performed at rest and immediately after muscular exercise is a promising method for diagnosing chronic exertional compartment syndrome and assessing its severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of pressure, temperature-controlled, continuously circulating hot saline (EnAbl system, InnerDyne Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) for endometrial ablation using the in vivo human uterus. DESIGN: Clinical safety study. SETTING: An academic research environment. PATIENTS: Eleven women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy because of abnormal uterine bleeding. INTERVENTION: Before uterine removal, endometrial cavities were exposed to 15 minutes of recirculatory normal saline heated to 70-85 degrees C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The uteri were analyzed for extent of thermal damage using standard histopathological techniques and tissue viability histochemical staining. Intrauterine pressures and serosal and subserosal temperatures were continuously monitored by computer. RESULT(S): In each treated specimen, histochemical staining demonstrated a depth of necrosis that extended through the entire endometrium and approximately 1-2 mm into the myometrium. The control specimen showed no thermal or mechanical damage. There were no observed negative effects or related complications with this system. CONCLUSION(S): The computer-controlled system employing continuously circulating hot saline is an effective method to destroy the endometrium. In four cases with clearly patent tubes, no spill was observed. In all 11 patients, serosal and subserosal temperatures were within safe levels (mean temperature, 37 degrees C).

TI  - Estimating the contributions of NMDA and non-NMDA currents to EPSPs in retinal ganglion cells.  
AB  - Whole-cell recordings were obtained from retinal ganglion cells of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) in a superfused slice preparation to evaluate contributions of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and KA/AMPA (kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalone propionic acid) receptors to excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of retinal ganglion cells. Synaptic activation of retinal ganglion cells was achieved through the use of a brief pressure pulse of hyperosmotic Ringer (Ringer + sucrose) delivered through a microelectrode visually placed in the inner plexiform layer while whole-cell recordings were obtained from adjacent cells in the ganglion cell layer. Separation of NMDA and KA/AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was achieved through the application of the antagonists NBQX and D-AP7, while inhibitory currents were blocked by strychnine and picrotoxin. Simple addition of the two independent EPSCs showed, most often, that the sum of the KA/AMPA and NMDA currents was less than the control response, but in some cases the sum of the two currents exceeded the magnitude of the control response. Neither result was consistent with expectations based on voltage-clamp principles and the assumption that the two currents were independent; for this reason, we considered the possibility of nonlinear interactions between KA/AMPA and NMDA receptors. Computer simulations were carried out to evaluate the summation experiments. We used both an equivalent cylinder model and a more realistic, compartmental model of a ganglion cell constrained by a passive leakage conductance, a linear KA/AMPA synaptic current, and a nonlinear NMDA current based on the well-known, voltage-sensitive Mg2+ block. Computer simulation studies suggest that the hypo- and hyper-summation of NMDA and KA/AMPA currents, observed physiologically, can be accounted for by a failure to adequately space clamp the neuron. Clamp failure leads to enhanced NMDA currents as the ion channels are relieved of the Mg2+ block; their contribution is thus exaggerated depending on the magnitude of the conductance change and the spatial location of the synaptic input.

TI  - Modified ureterosigmoidostomy (Mainz II)--technique and early results [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the surgical method and results at 3 months of ureterosigmoidostomy modified by reconfiguration of the rectum to make a low-pressure reservoir. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over the last 8 years, patients undergoing lower urinary tract reconstruction have been followed using a written protocol; the data from patients undergoing a modified ureterosigmoidostomy were retrieved for a retrospective analysis. Two groups of patients were defined: in group A, 15 patients underwent cystectomy and diversion by modified ureterosigmoidostomy and in group B, four patients already had a conventional ureterosigmoidostomy which was incontinent, and the rectum was reconfigured to improve control. The incidence of complications and causes of incontinence were assessed. RESULTS: The rectum was reconfigured by longitudinal incision and transverse closure in a 'U' fashion (Mainz II) in 17 patients, and augmented with ileum in two. There were no surgical complications. In group A all patients were continent at 3 months and in group B only two of four were continent; one patient in group A subsequently became incontinent. All incontinence was caused by chronic retention and overflow. There were no cases of pyelonephritis during follow-up to 29 months and no ureteric reflux was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Modified ureterosigmoidostomy is a safe method of urinary diversion after cystectomy. A longer follow-up is needed to judge its place compared with other forms of diversion. It has a limited place in the management of incontinence in those with a longstanding conventional ureterosigmoidostomy.

TI  - Evaluation of complete denture occlusal contacts using pressure-sensitive sheets.  
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of a new occlusal analysis system (Dental Prescale System) composed of pressure-sensitive sheets and a computer for analysis for complete denture wearers. In the laboratory portion of the study, the system registered values that were greater than the actual applied loads (mean 6.3 +/- 10.6 N). Clinical measurements of five parameters related to the analysis of occlusion were made using two groups: 50 wearers of nonadjusted complete dentures and 50 wearers of adjusted prostheses. An error discrimination rate of 16% resulted between the two groups. This system is capable of measuring occlusal pressure at every contact point and can be considered a useful method for occlusal analysis and patient screening.

PMID- 9465053
TI  - The pressure dependence of hydrophobic interactions is consistent with the observed pressure denaturation of proteins.  
AB  - Proteins can be denatured by pressures of a few hundred MPa. This finding apparently contradicts the most widely used model of protein stability, where the formation of a hydrophobic core drives protein folding. The pressure denaturation puzzle is resolved by focusing on the pressure-dependent transfer of water into the protein interior, in contrast to the transfer of nonpolar residues into water, the approach commonly taken in models of protein unfolding. Pressure denaturation of proteins can then be explained by the pressure destabilization of hydrophobic aggregates by using an information theory model of hydrophobic interactions. Pressure-denatured proteins, unlike heat-denatured proteins, retain a compact structure with water molecules penetrating their core. Activation volumes for hydrophobic contributions to protein folding and unfolding kinetics are positive. Clathrate hydrates are predicted to form by virtually the same mechanism that drives pressure denaturation of proteins.

TI  - Antinociceptive and antidepressant-like profiles of BL-2401, a novel enkephalinase inhibitor, in mice and rats.  
AB  - To clarify the properties of BL-2401 ((+/-)-3-[2-benzyl-3-(propionylthio) propionyl]amino-5-methylbenzoic acid), a novel enkephalinase inhibitor, we examined its antinociceptive and antidepressant-like activities after oral administration, along with their association with endogenous opioid systems. BL-2401 produced an antinociceptive effect after oral administration in the mouse phenylbenzoquinone writhing test (ED50: 12.4 mg/kg) and the rat acetic acid writhing test (ED50: 55.8 mg/kg), the antinociceptive effect being antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride. BL-2401 also relieved arthritis-induced hyperalgesia in rats. In the mouse hot-plate and tail pressure tests, BL-2401 showed significant but modest antinociception at higher doses (200 and 400 mg/kg). In addition, BL-2401 (100 mg/kg) produced a naloxone-reversible antidepressant-like effect in the mouse forced swimming test. As for the mechanism of the action, the active metabolite of BL-2401, BL-2240 ((+/-)-3-(2-benzyl-3-mercaptopropionyl) amino-5-methylbenzoic acid), selectively inhibited enkephalinase in vitro (IC50: 5.2 nM). Oral administration of BL-2401 to mice significantly inhibited the enkephalinase activity in the striatum and also potentiated the antinociceptive effect of (D-Ala2,Met5)-enkephalin given intracisternally. These findings indicate that BL-2401 is an orally active enkephalinase inhibitor and may produce antinociceptive and antidepressant-like effects in association with endogenous opioid systems.

TI  - Single-beat estimation of the ventricular pumping mechanics in terms of the systolic elastance and resistance.  
AB  - An elastance-resistance model has long been used to assess the systolic mechanical behavior of the ventricular pump under an in situ, open-chest experiment. However, there is difficulty in the clinical application of such a model because of the required isovolumetric signal that is obtained by occluding the ascending aorta in diastole. In this study, we determine the characteristics of an elastance-resistance model in the absence of isovolumeric measurement to quantify the physical properties of the left ventricle. A high-fidelity multisensor catheter was used to record the left ventricular pressure and ascending aortic flow in nine anesthetized, closed-chest dogs.  The isovolumetric pressure was estimated from the instantaneous pressure of an ejecting contraction by a curve-fitting technique. Thus, the parameters in the characterization of systolic pumping mechanics could be inferred by the use of fitting this elastance-resistance model. The results showed that the maximal systolic elastance was 7.3 +/- 2.8 mmHg and theoretical maximum flow was 494 +/- 194 ml s-1. These data were compatible with other reports in the literature. Moreover, in every dog studied the maximal systolic elastance was smaller than the end-systolic elastance which was determined by using the end-systolic pressure-volume relation. We suggested that an elastance-resistance model with the estimated isovolumetric pressure has the potential to measure the intrinsic systolic mechanics of the left ventricle in a closed-chest cardiovascular system.

We conclude that: 1) the mechanisms responsible for the acceleration in lung growth induced by tracheal obstruction are most active on d 2, remain active at a reduced level on d 4 and 7, and have returned to control levels by d 10; and 2) the increase in lung DNA content during tracheal obstruction (d 2-7) is closely related to the increase in lung liquid volume, but not to the increase in intraluminal pressure.

TI  - Stimulation of lung growth by tracheal obstruction in fetal sheep: relation to luminal pressure and lung liquid volume.  
AB  - Obstruction of the fetal trachea causes liquid to accumulate within the future airways, which is a potent stimulus for lung growth. Our aim was to determine the relationship between the increase in fetal lung growth after tracheal obstruction and the increases in lung liquid volume and tracheal pressure to better understand the mechanisms involved in the growth response. The effects of 4 and 10 d of tracheal obstruction on lung DNA and protein contents and DNA synthesis rates were determined; these data were combined with data collected previously after 2 and 7 d of tracheal obstruction. Fetal lung liquid volumes and secretion rates were measured before (d 0) and on d 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 after tracheal obstruction; fetal tracheal pressures were monitored throughout this period. Tracheal pressures increased from 2.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (control) to 4.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg within 1 d of tracheal obstruction and remained at this elevated level for the duration of the obstruction period. Lung liquid volume increased progressively from 24.7 +/- 1.1 mL/kg on d 0 to 97.3 +/- 15.2 mL/kg at d 7 of tracheal obstruction, but had not increased further by d 10. Tracheal obstruction significantly increased lung DNA and protein contents above control values; over the 10-d period the increase in lung DNA content was closely related (r = 0.99) to the increase in lung liquid volume, but not to the increase in tracheal pressure. DNA synthesis rates were increased at 4 d of tracheal obstruction (by 66%) but had returned to control levels by d 10. We conclude that: 1) the mechanisms responsible for the acceleration in lung growth induced by tracheal obstruction are most active on d 2, remain active at a reduced level on d 4 and 7, and have returned to control levels by d 10; and 2) the increase in lung DNA content during tracheal obstruction (d 2-7) is closely related to the increase in lung liquid volume, but not to the increase in intraluminal pressure. Thus, we suggest that an increase in lung expansion is one of the primary factors responsible for the acceleration in fetal lung growth induced by tracheal obstruction.

TI  - Coronary vascular responsiveness to adenosine is impaired additively by blockade of nitric oxide synthesis and a sulfonylurea.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to define effects of glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea known to block ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channels, and Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an L-arginine analog known to block nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, on coronary vascular responsiveness to adenosine. BACKGROUND: The role of adenosine in coronary flow regulation becomes increasingly important when KATP channel function or NO synthesis is impaired. Both variables are potentially altered in patients with coronary artery disease taking a sulfonylurea. METHODS: Dose-response curves relating coronary conductance to plasma adenosine concentration were obtained by using intracoronary infusions of adenosine (10 to 1,000 microg/min) in chronically instrumented dogs. RESULTS: ED50, the plasma concentration of adenosine needed to produce 50% of the maximal increase in conductance under baseline conditions, increased threefold after either 1 or 10 mg/kg of L-NAME. ED50 also increased in response to glibenclamide in a dose-related fashion (5.7-fold increase per 1 mg/kg body weight of glibenclamide). Effects of combined blockade of KATP channels and NO synthesis were additive, with increases in ED50 as high as 15-fold. Both L-NAME and glibenclamide increased systemic pressure and reduced coronary conductance, confirming the roles of NO and KATP channels in regulating coronary and systemic vascular tone under rest conditions as well as during stress. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary vascular responsiveness to adenosine is blunted in vivo by both L-NAME and glibenclamide. Effects of the sulfonylurea and blockade of NO synthesis are additive and can limit coronary vasodilation as well as other responses involving KATP channels and NO.

TI  - Haemodynamic effects of ketanserin either alone or with oxygen in COPD patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension.  
AB  - To indirectly test the hypothesis whether serotonin (5-HT) might have a role in the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, we evaluated the haemodynamic and gas exchange response of intravenous ketanserin (K), a 5-HT receptor inhibitor, in eight severe but stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with secondary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) 30.3 +/- 7.3 mmHg). Measurements were done at baseline, after oxygen breathing (2 L.min-1), K bolus (6-15 mg) and finally during oxygen breathing (2 L.min-1) added to K infusion (3-6 mg.h-1). K bolus induced a significant reduction of mean Ppa (p < 0.05), mean systemic arterial pressure (p < 0.01) and total systemic resistance (p < 0.01). Cardiac index (+7%), oxygen delivery (+7%) and pulmonary vascular resistance (magnitude of the reduction: -12%) did not change significantly. When oxygen was added to K infusion, the cardiac index significantly dropped when compared to K bolus (p < 0.05), but oxygen delivery remained stable because of the resulting increase in arterial oxygen concentration; against baseline, the mean Ppa showed the same magnitude of reduction as with oxygen breathing or K bolus alone (p < 0.05). Ventilation and gas exchange were not significantly influenced by K bolus. When we individually analysed the changes of pulmonary vascular resistances by plotting the driving pressure through the pulmonary circulation against the cardiac output, we observed that an active vasodilating effect on the pulmonary circulation occurred with K in only one patient, while in three other patients there was rather a recruitment effect of the pulmonary vessels due to the systemic effects of the drug. In conclusion, this study of a small number of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with pulmonary hypertension shows that the parenterally given serotonin antagonist ketanserin predominantly affects the systemic circulation. Our results do not support the hypothesis that in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with pulmonary hypertension, serotonin might have a role in the increase of pulmonary vascular tone.

TI  - Evaluation of trismus, bite force, and pressure algometry after third molar surgery: a placebo-controlled study of ibuprofen.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated trismus, bite force, and pressure algometry as measures of analgesic efficacy after third molar removal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (36 females and 21 males) developed at least moderate pain after surgical removal of a mandibular third molar and were given either ibuprofen, 400 mg (n = 26), or placebo (n = 31) in a double-blind study. Pain intensity and pain relief were rated on a five-point verbal rating scale during the 4-hour study period. Recordings of trismus, bilateral pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds, and bite force were performed before surgery, at medication, and hourly for 4 hours. Changes in the functional variables were calculated as percent change from baseline (before surgery). RESULTS: The pain intensity and pain relief ratings showed significant differences between the ibuprofen- and placebo-treated patients in the 4-hour study period. The changes in trismus, bite force, and pressure pain thresholds were in accordance with these pain ratings. Pressure pain detection threshold on the operated side was significantly lower in the placebo-treated patients compared with the ibuprofen-treated patients 2 and 3 hours after medication, whereas pressure tolerance threshold showed a significant difference after 2 hours. Bite force on the operated side was significantly less reduced 3 hours after treatment with ibuprofen when compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The functional measures used support the results obtained by rating of pain intensity and pain relief, and could be of value as measures of the efficacy of an analgesic to reduce functional impairment caused by postoperative pain.

TI  - Species variability in angiotensin receptor expression by cultured cardiac fibroblasts and the infarcted heart.  
AB  - Cardiac fibroblasts, an abundant cell of the left ventricle (LV), proliferate and synthesize collagen in the heart after acute injury and during pressure overload hypertrophy. From many studies, angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors have been implicated in promoting collagen formation by the rat cardiac fibroblast. The present study examined species variability in ANG II receptor expression. Cultured rat fibroblasts expressed 43,000 +/- 15,000 ANG II (AT1-specific) receptors per cell (dissociation constant = 0.92 +/- 0.34 nM), whereas rabbit and neonate human cardiac fibroblast cultures expressed few receptors. Angiotensin increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in rats but not in rabbit or human cardiac fibroblasts and stimulated arachidonic acid release in rat but not rabbit fibroblasts. In situ, 6 days after coronary artery ligation, angiotensin receptor expression was increased 34.8 +/- 13.4-fold in the infarcted area relative to the noninfarcted tissue in the rat LV, whereas rabbit hearts demonstrated only a 3.2 +/- 1.6-fold increase in ANG II binding within the infarcted tissue. These species differences in receptor expression raise questions as to the role of angiotensin as a mediator of collagen formation across species and as a direct target of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to regulate cardiac fibroblast function.

TI  - [Increased occurrence of esophageal hypermotility disorders in patients with arterial hypertension]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been noted in previous manometric examinations of the oesophagus in patients with chest pain that abnormal motility was often associated with arterial hypertension. A systematic study of this relationship was therefore undertaken. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 40 patients with chest pain (18 women and 22 men, mean age 54.7 [24-70] years) and in 20 healthy volunteers (12 men, 8 women, mean age 50.8 [22-63] years) standardized oesophageal manometry and arterial blood pressure monitoring were performed over 24 hours. Coronary heart disease and gastrointestinal lesions had been excluded by angiography and endoscopy, respectively. RESULTS: 20 patients (group H) had hypertension (median 24-hour blood pressure > 135/85 mmHg), while 20 patients (group N) and the normal controls (group K) were normotensive. Oesophageal manometry data differed significantly between the three groups regarding distal pressure amplitude (in hPa [hectopascals]; group H: 62 hPa*,**, group N 44 hPa* and group K 36 hPa**; [*P < 0.0005]) and the proportion of simultaneous contractions (group H 23%, group N 22%**, group K 10%***; ***P < 0.001). The hypertensive patients had significantly more frequent motility abnormalities than normal controls (13/20 vs 4/20, P < 0.001); while normotensive patients had more frequent episodes of abnormal propulsion in the oesophagus (proportion of propulsive contractions in group H: 53%, in N: 44%, in K: 59%; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Oesophageal motility differed significantly in patients with chest pain from that in healthy controls. Patients with chest pain and hypertension more frequently had oesophageal hypermotility. This suggests a generalized abnormality of smooth muscle.

TI  - Effects of positive pressure on both femoral venous and arterial blood velocities and the cutaneous microcirculation of the forefoot.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The balance between the apparent beneficial effect and the risk of arterial ischaemia resulting from an external uniform compression is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a positive uniform compression on the lower limb circulation until a critical threshold was reached. METHODS: We used Doppler ultrasound to measure femoral venous and arterial blood velocities. The effects of positive pressure on cutaneous microcirculation were evaluated by laser Doppler flux (LDF), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (tcpCO2) on the forefoot of 17 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The results are expressed as median [lowest observed value-highest observed value]. Whereas the arterial femoral velocity (A.F.V.) decreased from 0.21 [0.08-0.36] to 0.17 [0.08-0.28] m s-1 for an external pressure as low as 10 mmHg (p < 0.001), the venous femoral velocity (V.F.V.) decreased from 0.13 [0.06-0.40] to 0.09 [0.05-0.34] m s-1 at 20 mmHg (p < 0.001). An increase of tcpCO2 from 39.8 [29.9-53.7] to 40.2 [30.0-55.5] mmHg (p < 0.05) and a decrease of LDF from 8.7 [3.1-25.9] to 5.5 [2.3-21.1] A.U. (p < 0.001) occurred at 10 mmHg. However, tcpO2 decreased only from 76.7 [40.2-91.2] to 64.6 [18.9-85.2] mmHg when the splint pressure reached 60 mmHg (p < 0.05). The observed parameters (LDF, tcpO2, V.F.V. and A.F.V.) decreased further (except for tcpCO2 which increased) up to the end of the study as the applied pressure was increased. CONCLUSION: Positive pressure on the full leg provided no significant beneficial effect on femoral venous blood velocity. Whereas we showed that for an external uniform pressure as low as 10 mmHg, significant impairments in both arterial inflow of the lower limb and microcirculation of the forefoot appeared in recumbent healthy young subjects.

TI  - Assessment of distributed arterial network models.  
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of elastic non-linearities, viscoelasticity and resistance vessel modelling on arterial pressure and flow wave contours computed with distributed arterial network models. The computational results of a non-linear (time-domain) and a linear (frequency-domain) mode were compared using the same geometrical configuration and identical upstream and downstream boundary conditions and mechanical properties. pressures were computed at the ascending aorta, brachial and femoral artery. In spite of the identical problem definition, computational differences were found in input impedance modulus (max. 15-20%), systolic pressure (max. 5%) and pulse pressure (max. 10%). For the brachial artery, the ratio of pulse pressure to aortic pulse pressure was practically identical for both models (3%), whereas for the femoral artery higher values are found for the linear model (+10%). The aortic/brachial pressure transfer function indicates that pressure harmonic amplification is somewhat higher in the linear model for frequencies lower than 6 Hz while the opposite is true for higher frequencies. These computational disparities were attributed to conceptual model differences, such as the treatment of geometric tapering, rather than to elastic or convective non-linearities. Compared to the effect of viscoelasticity, the discrepancy between the linear and non-linear model is of the same importance. At peripheral locations, the correct representation of terminal impedance outweight the computational differences between the linear and non-linear models.

TI  - Effect of amino acids on lower esophageal sphincter characteristics and gastroesophageal reflux in humans.  
AB  - The effect of a commercially available mixed amino acids solution, when given either intravenously or intragastrically, on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, frequency of transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) was investigated in six healthy volunteers. LES pressure and esophageal pH were simultaneously recorded on three separate occasions 1 hr before (basal) and 3 hr during intravenous or intragastric infusion of amino acids (250 mg protein/kg/hr) or saline (control). No significant changes in LES pressure were seen in the control experiment. Intravenous amino acids caused a rapid and sustained (P < 0.01) decrease in LES pressure whereas intragastric amino acids decreased LES pressure only gradually and temporarily (P < 0.01). In the three experiments no significant differences were observed in TLESR frequency, the number of GER episodes, the mechanism of reflux, or duration of acid exposure. In healthy subjects both intragastric and, especially, intravenous infusion of amino acids significantly decrease LES pressure but do not affect the frequency of TLESRs or GER episodes during a continuous liquid gastric load.

TI  -  Pressure induces striatal serotonin and dopamine increases: a simultaneous analysis in free-moving microdialysed rats.  
AB  - High pressure is known as a basic etiological factor underlying central nervous system changes known as the high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS). In the rat, HPNS includes behavioural disturbances including locomotor and motor hyperactivities (LMA) linked to a striatal dopamine (DA) increase. Recent findings have shown that intracerebroventricular administration of 5-HT3 or 5-HT1b antagonists decrease both LMA and striatal DA increase suggesting that pressure could enhance the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. In this study, for the first time, the striatal levels of DA and 5-HT were simultaneously monitored using microdialysis in free-moving rats exposed to high pressure. Our results show that the striatal 5-HT level increases during pressure exposure. These data suggest that pressure-induced striatal 5-HT increase could participate in the increasing DA release. Nevertheless, the lack of correlation between striatal DA and 5-HT changes suggests that other processes are involved in the pressure-induced striatal DA increase.

TI  - Targeting the receptor-Gq interface to inhibit in vivo pressure overload myocardial hypertrophy.  
AB  - Hormones and neurotransmitters may mediate common responses through receptors that couple to the same class of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein. For example, several receptors that couple to Gq class proteins can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Class-specific inhibition of Gq-mediated signaling was produced in the hearts of transgenic mice by targeted expression of a carboxyl-terminal peptide of the alpha subunit Galphaq.  When pressure overload was surgically induced, the transgenic mice developed significantly less ventricular hypertrophy than control animals. The data demonstrate the role of myocardial Gq in the initiation of myocardial hypertrophy and indicate a possible strategy for preventing pathophysiological signaling by simultaneously blocking multiple receptors coupled to Gq.

The amount of water-soluble starch increased with the increase of steam pressure, but the amounts of methanol-soluble material and Klason lignin remained insignificant, regardless of steam pressure. The potatoes exploded at high pressure were hydrolyzed into a low molecular liquid starch, and then easily converted into ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using mixed microorganisms: an amylolytic microorganism, Aspergillus awamori, and a fermentation microorganism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The maximal ethanol concentration was 4.2 g/L in a batch culture at 15 g/L starch concentration, and 3.6 g/L in a continuous culture fed the same starch concentration. In the fed-batch culture, the maximal ethanol concentration increased more than twofold, compared to the batch culture.

TI  - End-systolic pressure-dimension relationship of in situ mouse left ventricle.  
AB  - The increasing popularity of genetically engineered mice in cardiovascular research has made it important to evaluate cardiac function in small animals. We have developed a system to enable simultaneous pressure-dimension analysis of the mouse left ventricle. The chest was opened under anesthesia, and a 1.4 F micromanometer catheter was inserted into the left ventricle through the apex. A pair of sonomicrometry crystals were attached to the anterior and posterior walls using tissue adhesive. Pressure and dimension were recorded simultaneously at baseline and after isoproterenol injection (1 micro g, intraperitoneally). The ascending aorta was occluded transiently to estimate the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship (ESPDR), which was parameterized subsequently by the quadratic equation: Pes=C2 X (Des-D0)2+E0 X (Des-D0), where Pes is end-systolic pressure, Des is end-systolic dimension, D0 is the dimension axis intercept, E0 is the local slope at D0, and C2 is the curvilinearity coefficient. The maximum and minimum external dimensions at baseline were 5.82+/-0.50 (s.d.) mm and 5.49+/-0.46 mm with fractional shortening of 0.057+/-0.014 (n=12). The ESPDR was significantly curvilinear and increased convexity after isoproterenol injection (C2, -444+/-281 to -1113+/-780 mmHg/mm2, P<0. 05; E0, 536+/-175 to 889+/-276 mmHg/mm, P<0.001), while the dimension axis intercept remained relatively constant (D0, 5.39+/-0. 46 to 5.37+/-0.52 mm). In conclusion, the combination of miniature piezo-electric crystals and a micromanometer enables continuous measurement of pressure and dimension of in situ mouse left ventricle. This technology may be useful in evaluating the cardiac phenotype of genetically engineered mice.Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Influence of oscillatory and unidirectional flow environments on the expression of endothelin and nitric oxide synthase in cultured endothelial cells.  
AB  - In vivo, endothelial cells (ECs) are subjected to a complex mechanical environment composed of shear stress, pressure, and circumferential stretch. The aim of this study was to subject bovine aortic ECs to a pulsatile pressure oscillating from 70 to 130 mm Hg (mean of 100 mm Hg) in combination with pulsatile shear stresses from 0.1 to 6 dyne/cm2 (1 dyne/cm2=0.1 N/m2) with or without a cyclic circumferential stretch of 4% for 1, 4, and 24 hours. The effect of highly reversing oscillatory shear stress (range -3 to +3 dyne/cm2, mean of 0.3 dyne/cm2) typical of regions prone to the development of atherosclerotic plaques was also studied at 4 and 24 hours. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) mRNA expression was time and mechanical force dependent. ET-1 mRNA was maximal at 4 hours and decreased to less than static culture expression at 24 hours, whereas ecNOS mRNA increased over time. Pressure combined with low shear stress upregulated ET-1 and ecNOS mRNA compared with static control. Additional increase in expression for both genes was observed under a combination of higher shear stress and pressure. A cyclic circumferential stretch of 4% did not induce a further increase in ET-1 and ecNOS mRNA at either low or high shear stress. Oscillatory shear stress with pressure induced a higher expression of ET-1 mRNA but lower expression of ecNOS mRNA compared with unidirectional shear stress and pressure. We have shown that the combination of pressure and oscillatory shear stress can downregulate ecNOS levels, as well as upregulate transient expression of ET-1, compared with unidirectional shear stress. These results provide a new insight into the exact role of mechanical forces in endothelial dysfunction in regions prone to the development of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Growth potential and left ventricular diastolic function in cardiomyoplasty.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is an experimental operation for advanced heart failure. Current clinical results bring the possibility of its application to children. This study was designed to obtain information about the relationship between cardiomyoplasty and growth of the heart. METHODS: Six beagles, 9 to 10 weeks old, underwent cardiomyoplasty without electric stimulation (cardiomyoplasty group), and another 5 beagles underwent median sternotomy and pericardiotomy (control group). Six months later, weights of hearts, wrapped latissimus dorsi muscles, and unwrapped right latissimus dorsi muscles and pressure-volume relationships were obtained. RESULTS: Wrapped latissimus dorsi muscles weighed 33 +/- 3 g (mean +/- standard deviation), and unwrapped muscles weighed 68 +/- 5 g. The heart weight was 82 +/- 3 g in the cardiomyoplasty group and 89 +/- 7 g in the control group. Left ventricular maximum elastance was 3.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/mL in the cardiomyoplasty group and 3.9 +/- 0.9 mm Hg/mL in the control group. End-diastolic pressure versus end-diastolic volume ratios were 0.52 +/- 0.03 and 0.54 +/- 0.05, respectively. Pathologic examination showed fat infiltration and muscle fiber atrophy in the cardiomyoplasty group. CONCLUSIONS: The wrapped latissimus dorsi muscle flaps were growing and the diastolic function was not impaired. This indicates a potentially safe clinical application of dynamic cardiomyoplasty for children.

TI  - [Methods for coronary functional assessment]  
AB  - Functional evaluation of coronary vasomotion encompasses the assessment of dynamic changes in coronary lumen, vessel wall, blood flow, intracoronary pressure and myocardial perfusion in response to specific pharmacologic stimuli. These parameters are obtained to characterize mechanisms of physiologic regulation and to evaluate pathophysiologic processes and potential therapeutic strategies, especially with regard to the development of coronary atherosclerosis. To this end, a variety of direct (invasive) and indirect (non-invasive) diagnostic tools are employed. Among the invasive methods are registration of intracoronary Doppler flow, coronary pressure measurements, quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound. The non-invasive modalities consist of coronary Doppler echocardiography, positron emission tomography, myocardial scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. Because of the different technical and physiological principles involved, these methods are complementary by providing independent access to different aspects. The combined invasive functional testing as employed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory allows for a simultaneous synopsis of high-resolution coronary imaging and direct measurement of physiologic parameters during local application of defined pharmacologically active substances. However, the demands in terms of equipment, time and operator skills are high and limit this combined invasive approach to specialized centers. Besides these research purposes, a number of functional methods has entered the clinical arena. They are employed to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions and to assess functional outcome of therapeutic interventions in the catheterization laboratory. The underlying principles and applications of the different methods are described and an overview of selected results is presented.

TI  - Assessment of the acute arterial effects of converting enzyme inhibition in essential hypertension: a double-blind, comparative and crossover study.  
AB  - In subjects with essential hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition increases arterial diameter, compliance and distensibility of peripheral muscular arteries in association with blood pressure reduction. Whether pulse pressure amplification is modified by ACE inhibition and whether changes in compliance and distensibility are due to a drug effect on the arterial wall, to the blood pressure reduction or to a combination of both factors, is largely ignored. In a randomised, double-blind crossover trial, we used the ACE inhibitor quinapril as a marker to evaluate the changes in: pulse pressure amplification (applanation tonometry), carotid compliance and distensibility (echo-tracking technique), and aortic distensibility (measured from pulse wave velocity). Quinapril decreased in the same extent carotid and brachial pulse pressure, thus causing a resetting of pulse pressure amplification toward normal values. Carotid compliance and distensibility as well as aortic distensibility increased significantly. Based on three-way analysis of variance, it was shown that, whereas the changes in carotid stiffness were exclusively due to blood pressure reduction and not to a drug-induced relaxation of the arterial wall, the changes in aortic distensibility were due to the combination of both factors. Thus, using an atraumatic non-invasive procedure, it was possible to show that: (i) ACE inhibition is able to maintain pulse pressure amplification, an important factor contributing to reduce the afterload of the heart; and (ii) ACE inhibition alters the hypertensive arterial wall in a very heterogeneous manner, with a maximal drug effect on muscular large arteries like the abdominal aorta, and not on elastic arteries like the carotid artery and the thoracic aorta.

TI  - Effect of patient position and hypotensive anesthesia on inferior vena caval pressure.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective study to measure the inferior vena caval pressure of 20 patients in different positions and different states of blood pressure. OBJECTIVES: Because the inferior vena caval pressure could affect the vertebral venous pressure, which in turn may influence blood loss during lumbar spinal surgery, this study was designed to provide the quantitative data necessary to stress the importance of patient positioning and to assess the effect of controlled hypotension on inferior vena caval pressure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Positioning patients with a pendulous abdomen and controlled hypotension has been practiced widely during lumbar spinal surgery. It is generally believed that the former will help reduce vertebral venous engorgement and the latter will produce a bloodless surgical wound. However, there have been no complete studies in which quantitative changes of inferior vena caval pressure resulting from different positions was examined. In addition, it would be interesting to know what happens to inferior vena caval pressure during induced hypotension. Could there be an adverse effect on the inferior vena caval pressure during the hypotensive state? METHODS: An intravenous catheter was introduced into the inferior vena cava in each of 20 patients undergoing spinal surgery. In each patient, the inferior vena caval pressure was measured when the patient was supine, prone on a conventional pad, and prone on a Relton-Hall frame. It was followed by isoflurane-induced hypotension with reduction of mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg. RESULTS: In this series, the inferior vena caval pressure ranged from 8.2 to 23.4 mm Hg (with a mean of 15.3 mm Hg) when patients were positioned prone on a conventional pad. However, when they were subsequently positioned prone on a Relton-Hall frame, the inferior vena caval pressure decreased dramatically to a range of 4.6 to 13.6 mm Hg (with a mean of 8.2 mm Hg). In each patient the measured inferior vena caval pressure when positioned prone on a conventional pad was 1.5 times greater than that measured with the patient positioned on a Relton-Hall frame. There was a statistically significant difference between these two positions (F = 75.996; P < 0.05). The patients' mean arterial pressure ranged from 92 to 105 mm Hg before induced hypotension. During this time, the inferior vena caval pressure ranged from 4.1 to 13.1 mm Hg (mean, 8.2 mm Hg). During the hypotensive state, the patients' inferior vena caval pressure was found to range from 4.2 to 13.6 mm Hg (mean, 8.1 mm Hg). In each patient the hypotensive interior vena caval pressure may be slightly higher or lower than the baseline pressure. However, the variation never exceeded 1.7 mm Hg. Statistically, there was no significant difference between these two periods (t = 0.956; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A device allowing the patient's abdominaL viscera to hang freely while the patient is in a prone position significantly reduces their inferior vena caval pressure. The patients also has a constant inferior vena caval pressure during isoflurane-induced hypotension.

TI  - Outcome of vaportrode transurethral vaporization of the prostate using pressure-flow urodynamic criteria.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use pressure-flow urodynamic parameters to evaluate the outcome of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were treated with transurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP) using the Vaportrode. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients (mean age 71.7 years) undergoing TUVP for treatment of symptomatic obstructive BPH or urinary retention were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Score, uroflowmetry, and pressure-flow multichannel urodynamic studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were voiding preoperatively. Eleven patients presented with urinary retention and were analyzed separately. At 3-month mean follow-up, the AUA Symptom Score decreased from 20.7 to 7.2 (n = 26). Peak uroflow rate (Qmax) increased from 8.2 to 15.5 mL/s (n = 27), whereas detrusor pressure at maximal flow (Pdet) decreased from 95.0 to 44.7 cm H2O (n = 24), indicating relief of obstruction. Postvoid residual urine volume decreased from 181.8 to 37.3 mL (n = 27). At 1-year mean follow-up, the AUA Symptom Score was 5.6 (n = 15) and Qmax was 14.3 mL/s (n = 19). The overall complication rate was 17.5% and included meatal stenosis (n = 1), bulbar urethral stricture (n = 1), refractory detrusor hyperreflexia (n = 1), dystrophic bladder neck calcification (n = 1), prostatic synechial formation requiring revision (n = 2), and residual prostatic tissue requiring revision (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides objective evidence that TUVP is effective in providing prompt relief of bladder outlet obstruction with durable improvement in symptoms and flow rate with no acute morbidity. Accordingly, TUVP should continue to be considered as a minimally invasive surgical alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the operative results after extended myectomy and surgical reconstruction of the subvalvular mitral apparatus in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy using dynamic three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the value of dynamic three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for the postoperative evaluation after extended myectomy and surgical reconstruction of the subvalvular mitral valve apparatus in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). BACKGROUND: Two-dimensional imaging techniques such as echocardiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have not been able to precisely quantify the effects of surgical therapy on the morphology of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). METHODS: Multiplane TEE with 3D reconstruction was performed in 11 patients before and after the operation and in 16 normal control subjects for comparison. The preoperative maximal systolic pressure gradient in the LVOT was 69 +/- 59 mm Hg. The following variables were measured within the dynamic 3D data set: depth, width, length and cross-sectional area (CSA) gain caused by the myectomy trough, minimal CSA of the LVOT at each time point and its cyclic changes and maximal mitral leaflet deviation during systole. RESULTS: Functional class improved from 3.0 +/- 0.2 before the operation to 1.5 +/- 0.6 after it.  The maximal systolic pressure gradient in the outflow tract decreased to 26 +/- 21 mm Hg postoperatively (p < 0.001). Minimal CSA of the outflow tract increased from 1.1 +/- 1.2 to 3.8 +/- 1.9 cm2 postoperatively (p < 0.001), similar to the value of the control group (4.2 +/- 1.5 cm2, p = NS). The area gain due to the myectomy trough was 1.3 +/- 1.0 cm2, corresponding to 48 +/- 12% of the total operative area difference. Maximal systolic depth of the myectomy was 7 +/- 2 mm, maximal width was 20 +/- 8 mm and length was 28 +/- 7 mm. Maximal deviation of the mitral leaflets fell from 15 +/- 7 to 6 +/- 7 mm postoperatively (p < 0.01). In five patients mass measurements of the intracavitary portion of the papillary muscle (PM) revealed an increase from 7.3 +/- 1.0 to 12.1 +/- 2.5 g due to surgical mobilization of PMs (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 3D TEE quantifies the differences in outflow tract morphology before and after surgery for HOCM. This technique may have an impact on the planning of operative interventions and allow for the evaluation of its results.

TI  - Pelvic floor function in patients with clinically complete spinal cord injury and its relation to constipation.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Constipation is a common problem in patients with spinal cord injury. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of pelvic floor dysfunction in the development of constipation. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with clinically complete supraconal spinal cord injury were studied by means of colonic transit time, anal manometry, electrophysiologic testing, and sensory-evoked potentials. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had prolonged total and segmental colonic transit times (Group C), and nine patients had normal colonic transit times (Group NC).  Basal pressure and anal pressure during coughing, Valsalva's maneuver, and rectal distention were diminished in all patients, but no differences were observed between Group C and Group NC. Rectal sensation was preserved in eight patients, but this was not related to the absence of constipation. In seven of these eight patients, somatosensory-evoked potentials could be recorded, which indicated an incomplete cord lesion. Synergic relaxation of the pelvic floor during straining was never observed; dyssynergia was seen in ten (7 in Group C and 3 in Group NC; P = not significant) patients. Associated peripheral nerve damage was present in 40 percent of patients but did not predispose these patients to constipation. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of rectal sensation, dyssynergic pelvic floor contraction during straining, associated peripheral nerve damage, and insufficient rise of intraabdominal pressure could not be held responsible for constipation as a result of spinal cord injury. A prolongation of the colonic transit time is the most important mechanism, and therapy should be directed toward it.

AB  - Artificial ventilation of the lungs with positive pressure at the end of respiration and inverse ratio of the respiratory phases was used in patients with wounds and grave mechanical injuries involving acute injuries to the lungs. Negative effect of positive pressure at the end of respiration on gas exchange, hemodynamics, and biomechanics of the lungs was confirmed and therefore this method is not recommended for such patients. Artificial ventilation of the lungs with inverse ratio of the respiratory phases improved gas exchange and biomechanical properties of the lungs, reduced the negative effect of forced ventilation on hemodynamics, and decreased the incidence of complications.

TI  - Nitric oxide inhibition induces early activation of type I collagen gene in renal resistance vessels and glomeruli in transgenic mice. Role of endothelin.  
AB  - Hypertension is often associated with the development of nephroangio- and glomerulo-sclerosis. This pathophysiological process is due to increased extracellular matrix protein, particularly type I collagen, accumulation. This study investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is involved in the mechanism(s) regulating activation of the collagen I gene in afferent arterioles and glomeruli. Experiments were performed on transgenic mice harboring the luciferase gene under the control of the collagen I-alpha2 chain promoter [procolalpha2(I)]. Measurements of luciferase activity provide highly sensitive estimates of collagen I gene activation. NO synthesis was inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg per day) for a period of up to 14 wk. Systolic blood pressure was increased after 6 wk of treatment (117+/-2 versus 129+/-2 mmHg, P < 0.01) and reached a plateau after 10 wk (around 160 mmHg). Luciferase activity was increased in freshly isolated afferent arterioles and glomeruli as early as week 4 of L-NAME treatment (150 and 200% of baseline, P < 0.01, respectively). The activation of procolalpha2(I) became more pronounced with time, and at 14 wk increased four- and tenfold compared with controls in afferent arterioles and glomeruli, respectively (P < 0.001). In contrast, luciferase activity remained unchanged in aorta and heart up to 8 wk and was increased thereafter. Increased histochemical staining for extracellular matrix deposition, and particularly of collagen I, was detected in afferent arterioles and glomeruli after 10 wk of L-NAME treatment. This fibrogenic process was accompanied by an increased urinary excretion rate of endothelin. In separate experiments, the stimulatory effect of L-NAME on collagen I gene activation was abolished when animals were treated with bosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist. Similarly, bosentan reduced the increased extracellular matrix deposition in afferent arterioles and glomeruli during NO inhibition. Interestingly, bosentan had no effect on the L-NAME- induced increase of systolic pressure. These data indicate that NO inhibition induces an early activation of the collagen I gene in afferent arterioles and glomeruli. This activation in the kidney precedes the increase in blood pressure and the procolalpha2(I) activation in heart and aorta, suggesting a specific renal effect of NO blockade on collagen I gene expression that is independent of increased blood pressure and, at least partly, mediated through stimulation of the endothelin receptor. Use of procolalpha2(I) transgenic mice provides a novel and efficient model to study the pathophysiological mechanism(s) regulating renal fibrosis.

TI  - Characterization of the stretch-activated chloride channel in isolated human atrial myocytes.  
AB  - Macroscopic and unitary currents through stretch-activated Cl- channels were examined in isolated human atrial myocytes using whole-cell, excised outside-out and inside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique. When K+ and Ca2+ conductances were blocked and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was reduced, application of positive pressure via the pipette activated membrane currents under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions. The reversal potential of the current shifted by 60 mV per 10-fold change in the external Cl- concentration, indicating that the current was Cl- selective. The current was inhibited by bath application of 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-AC). beta-Adrenergic stimulation failed to activate a Cl- current. In single channel recordings from outside-out patches, positive pressure in the pipette activated the unitary current with half-maximal activation of 14.7 mm Hg at +40 mV. The current-voltage relationship of single channel activity obtained in inside-out patches was linear in symmetrical Cl- solution with the averaged slope conductance of 8.6 +/- 0.7 pS (mean +/- SD, n = 10). The reversal potential shift of the channel by changing Cl- concentration was consistent with a Cl- selective channel. The open time distribution was best described by a single exponential function with mean open lifetime of 80.4 +/- 9.6 msec (n = 9), while at least two exponentials were required to fit the closed time distributions with a time constant for the fast component of 11.5 +/- 2.2 msec (n = 9) and that for the slow component of 170.2 +/- 21.8 msec (n = 9). Major changes in the single channel activity in response to pressure were caused by changes in the interburst interval. Single channel activity was inhibited by DIDS and 9-AC in a manner similar to whole-cell configuration. These results suggest that membrane stretch induced by applying pressure via the pipette activated a Cl- current in human atrial myocytes. The current was sensitive to Cl- channel blockers and exhibited membrane voltage-independent bursting opening without sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation.

TI  - Local delivery infusion pressure is a key determinant of vascular damage and intimal thickening.  
AB  - Local drug delivery following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may prevent restenosis by achieving higher local tissue concentrations of drugs than systemic administration. However, it remains unknown whether vascular damage and the ensuing intimal thickening is associated with the degree of infusion pressure achieved by local delivery. Therefore, local delivery of normal saline was performed using a channeled balloon catheter (Transport) to the rabbit iliac artery with different infusion pressures of 0, 3, 5, 7, and 12 atm (n=4 for each). The extent of vascular damage and the development of intimal thickening were determined histopathologically 14 days after the procedure. In 10 additional rabbits, to assess the degree of vessel penetration, local delivery of indocyanine green dye solution was performed in a similar fashion. After 1 h, the green dye penetrated deeply at the higher infusion pressures of 7 and 12 atm. The incidence of internal clastic lamina laceration and occurrence of total occlusion as a result of thrombus formation demonstrated an increase proportional to the degree of local infusion pressure. When the vascular injury score in each arterial section was plotted against the infusion pressure, a significant relation was observed (r=0.717, p<0.0001). At 0, 3, 5, 7, and 12 atm, neointimal areas of 0.160+/-0.005, 0.163+/-0.008, 0.189+/-0.017, 0.260+/-0.027, and 0.329+/-0.033 mm2, respectively, were observed. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferative activity also increased in proportion to the local infusion pressure. We have demonstrated for the first time that local delivery infusion pressure itself is related to the severity of vascular damage, resulting in the development of intimal thickening and an associated increase in SMC proliferative activity. Therefore, we suggest that infusion pressure is a key determinant of vascular injury during local drug delivery, with lower pressure causing the least neointimal response.

TI  - A transient dilatation of pressurised rat cerebral arteries during rapid pressure increases is mediated by nitric oxide.  
AB  - In pressurised resistance arteries in vitro, rapid pressure increases cause a transient "peak" dilatation, followed by a myogenic constriction. The mechanism of transient dilatation was investigated in isolated rat cerebral arteries in vitro using pressure myography. The peak increased with the amplitude of the pressure step. A near-maximal dilatation to 118+/-1.6% (SEM, n=20) of the diameter at 30 mmHg was produced by pressure steps from 30 to 75 mmHg. Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 20 microM) depressed the peak at the onset of a 30 to 75 mmHg pressure step to 49.8+/-14% of the control (n=6; P=0.04). D-NAME (20 microM) had no significant effect (82.1+/-13%; n=4; P=0.13). L-Arginine (400 microM) enhanced the peak (164+/-17% of control; n=8; P=0.01). Oxadiazolol (4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 2 microM) depressed the peak to 33.2+/-12% of control (n=5; P=0.012). 6-Anilino-5, 8-quinolinedone (LY 83583, 10 microM) depressed the peak to 18.8+/-2. 9% of control (n=3; P=0.01). Removing the endothelium decreased the peak to 15.3+/-11% of control (n=3; P=0.04). In conclusion, in rat cerebral arteries, the initial dilatation at the onset of a rapid step increase in pressure is an active dilatation involving endothelial NO release.

TI  - [The effect of gidazepam on the cardiovascular system function in patients with neurotic reactions and in healthy subjects under aggravated conditions]  
AB  - Administration of 0.05 g gidazepam once or twice daily for 7 days increased the stroke volume (SV) and circulation volume (CV) and reduced total peripheral resistance in neurotic patients. In healthy individuals 0.05 g gidazepam administered 60 min before an important examination stabilized CV. In subjects kept for 60 min in a microclimate with increasing temperature (55 +/- 2 degrees C, relative humidity 75-80%, rate of movement 1.5 m/min, rectal temperature at the end of exposure 39 degrees C) 0.05 g gidazepam administered 60 min before overheating optimally reorganized the reaction of the cardiovascular system, stabilized the SV at the initial level, which together with the growing heart rate increased the CV and provided sufficient perfusion of the vital organs. In healthy subjects working as operators for 4 h under conditions of hypercapnia (1.5% CO2), a single administration of 0.05 g gidazepam one hour before the beginning of work reduced the pulse pressure and increased the SV. The results obtained are evidence of the safety of using gidazepam as a corrector of emotion-induced disorders in operator performance under extreme conditions.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of tracheal pressure estimation from the endotracheal tube cuff pressure.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Air flow through an endotracheal tube causes a pressure drop across the tube. This pressure drop creates a difference between air pressure measured in the trachea and the pressure measured in the breathing circuit, which can lead to errors when calculating pulmonary mechanics and when setting ventilators. We have developed a method of estimating tracheal pressure from the pressure in the endotracheal tube cuff and tested this system in clinical trials. METHODS: Pressure measurement ports were placed between the Y piece of the ventilator circuit and the ETT connector, in the trachea at the carinal end of the ETT, and in the ETT cuff inflation line. Tracheal pressures and cuff pressures were found at end-inspiration and end-expiration (no flow states) and used to define a linear relationship between cuff pressure and tracheal pressure. Using the estimated tracheal pressure (Ptrach) and the measured pressure at the Y piece of the breathing circuit (PY), the pressure drop across the ETT was found as a function of flow through the tube.  Tracheal pressure was then calculated from the flow-dependent pressure drop and PY. Tests of this system were performed in six patients in the operating room and six patients in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The flow-based tracheal pressure estimates were within 0.7 +/- 0.4 cm H2O of actual tracheal pressure (mean +/- SD). At peak inspiratory pressure the difference averaged 0.5 +/- 0.3 cm H2O. The difference between our estimate of tracheal pressure and actual tracheal pressure was always less than 1 cm H2O. CONCLUSION: The flow-based tracheal pressure estimates were accurate during intermittent spontaneous breathing, but not during spontaneous breathing or with a poorly inflated cuff. The estimates were more immune to noise than the cuff-based estimates of tracheal pressure. The estimates of tracheal pressure measured from the ETT cuff should be accurate enough for clinical use in the operating room.

TI  - Mechanisms of residual lumen stenosis after high-pressure stent implantation: a quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies have demonstrated that stents are frequently suboptimally expanded despite the use of high pressures for deployment. The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms responsible for such residual lumen stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-seven lesions from 50 patients treated with high-pressure (median+/-interquartile range, 14+/-2 atm) elective (44 de novo, 13 restenotic lesions) stenting were prospectively studied (29 Wiktor, Medtronic; 28 Palmaz-Schatz, Cordis Corp). Balloon subexpansion was calculated as the difference between maximal and minimal balloon cross-sectional areas at peak pressure measured by automatic edge detection; elastic recoil was calculated as the difference between minimal measured balloon size and IVUS-derived minimal lumen area within the stent. Angiographic residual diameter stenosis was 10+/-13% (reference diameter, 3.1+/-0.7 mm; balloon to artery ratio, 1.12+/-0.23) and IVUS-derived stent expansion was 80+/-28%. However, although balloon nominal size was 9.6+/-1.3 mm2 and maximal balloon size measured inside the coronary lumen was 12.5+/-3.2 mm2, final stent minimal lumen area was only 7.1+/-2.2 mm2. Balloon subexpansion of 4.0+/-1.8 mm2 (33%) and elastic recoil of 1.6+/-2.3 mm2 (20%) (both P<0.0001) were the two mechanisms responsible for residual luminal stenosis. Wiktor stent and peak inflation pressure correlated with balloon subexpansion, whereas Wiktor stent, de novo lesion, and minimal lumen area at baseline correlated with elastic recoil. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high-pressure deployment, lumen dimensions after stenting are only 57% of maximal achievable. Inadequate balloon expansion and elastic recoil are responsible for residual lumen stenosis, suggesting that plaque characteristics and stent resistance deserve further investigation.

TI  - Flow regulation of 72-kD collagenase IV (MMP-2) after experimental arterial injury.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: MMP-2 plays a key role in basement membrane degradation and in the migration of proliferating smooth muscle cells after vascular injury. Because low flow and shear stress have been related to the localization and progression of intimal hyperplasia, we hypothesized that flow conditions modulate in vivo MMP-2 transcription and activity in a model of injury-induced intimal thickening. METHODS AND RESULTS: The right common carotid artery (CCA) was balloon-injured in 21 New Zealand White male rabbits. Flow was thereafter preserved (normal flow, n=7), reduced by partial outflow occlusion (low flow, n=7), or increased by ligation of the left CCA (high flow, n=7). In 15 other animals (controls without injury), flow was reduced (n=5), increased (n=5), or preserved (n=5). Mean blood flow and pressure in the right CCA were measured before and after flow modulation (day 0) and before the rabbits were killed (day 7). Northern analysis, gelatin-gel zymography, and fluorometric assays were performed on day 7 to determine MMP-2 mRNA levels and activity in relation to flow and intimal thickening. Mean flow was reduced from 21+/-1 to 7+/-1 mL/min (P<0.05) by outflow occlusion and increased to 31+/-2 mL/min (P<0.05) by ligation of the contralateral CCA. Blood pressure was not different between the flow groups. Hemodynamic parameters were similar for days 0 and 7 after flow modulation. In the injured right CCA, there was a 186% increase in MMP-2 mRNA with normal flow (P<0.05), a 366% increase with low flow (P<0.005), and only a 38% increase with high flow (P>0.05) compared with the uninjured CCA with normal flow. In the uninjured CCA, MMP-2 mRNA levels were increased by only 39% and 26% in the low- and high-flow groups, respectively, compared with normal-flow controls. The zymographic signal and quantitative fluorescent activity of gelatinase were markedly increased in both injured and uninjured CCAs subjected to low flow. Intimal thickening was observed after 1 week only in CCA segments with low flow and injury. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic forces such as low flow upregulate injury-induced MMP-2 mRNA and appear to be more important in regulating MMP-2 activity than injury alone. This may facilitate migration of the smooth muscle cells and subsequent development of intimal thickening.

TI  - Home bladder pressure monitoring in children with myelomeningocele [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluate a pressure gauge used at home for patients with myelomeningocele on clean intermittent catheterization to provide a system for inexpensive frequent monitoring of bladder pressures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with myelomeningocele using clean intermittent catheterization underwent cystometry in the laboratory. At home they obtained weekly volumes and bladder pressures before and after emptying. Home estimate of detrusor pressure was defined as full bladder pressure minus empty bladder pressure. Medication changes, subject position and urinary tract symptoms were noted. RESULTS: A total of 11 subjects 10.5+/-7.3 years old have been enrolled and have made 16.7+/-12.6 weekly home bladder pressure and volume recordings in 4.7+/-3.1 months. Bladder capacities measured at home were 132+/-47% of cystometric capacities. At volumes of data overlap home full pressures (31+/-10 cm. water) were not statistically different from cystometric vesical pressures (25+/-9 cm. water). Home empty pressures (7+/-4 cm. water) were similar to cystometric abdominal pressures (14+/-8 cm. water). Home estimates of detrusor pressures (23+/-7 cm. water) magnified differences in full and empty pressures, and were significantly greater than cystometric detrusor pressures (11+/-11 cm. water). In 2 subjects significant increases in home full pressures occurred, which were associated with cessation of anticholinergic medication and infection. CONCLUSIONS: Home monitoring of bladder pressure is a simple, inexpensive and accurate method of obtaining frequent bladder pressures in patients with myelomeningocele. These pressures are consistent over a large range of volumes and times, and could potentially be used to identify quickly changes in patient condition.

TI  - High-pressure freezing causes structural alterations in phospholipid model membranes.  
AB  - The influence of high-pressure freezing (HPF) on the lipid arrangement in phospholipid model membranes has been investigated. Liposomes consisting of pure dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and of DPPC mixed with a branched-chain phosphocholine (1,2-di(4-dodecyl-palmitoyl)- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) have been analysed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The liposomes were frozen either by plunging into liquid propane or by HPF. The characteristic macroripple-phase of the two-component liposome system is drastically changed in its morphology when frozen under high-pressure conditions. The influence of ethanol which acts as pressure transfer medium was ruled out by control experiments. In contrast, no high-pressure alterations of the pure DPPC bilayer membrane have been observed. We assume that the modification of the binary system is due to a pressure-induced relaxation of a stressed and unstable lipid molecule packing configuration. HPF was performed with a newly designed sample holder, for using sandwiched copper platelets with the high-pressure freezing machine Balzers HPM010. The sandwich construction turned out to be superior to the original holder system with regard to freeze-fracturing of fluid samples. By inserting a spacer between the supports samples with a thickness of 20-100 microns can be high-pressure frozen. The sandwich holder is provided with a thermocouple to monitor cooling rates and allows exact sample temperature control. Despite a two-fold mass reduction compared to the original holder no HPF cooling rate improvement has been achieved (4000 degrees Cs-1). We conclude that the cooling process in high-pressure freezing is determined mainly by cryogen velocity.

TI  - Influence of polyols on the structural properties of Kluyveromyces lactis beta-galactosidase under high hydrostatic pressure.  
AB  - The conformational changes in dimeric Kluyveromyces lactis beta-galactosidase induced by hydrostatic pressure were investigated by means of its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence.  At high pressure, the fluorescence emission spectrum was shifted to the red, indicating the exposure of buried Trp residues to the aqueous solvent. This spectral change was paralleled by a loss of enzyme activity. The shift of the emission spectrum was quantified by evaluating the centre of spectral mass ((nu(g))), which is an intensity-weighted mean wavenumber. The experimental data could be fitted to a two-state transition (native<-->denatured), corrected for a linear pressure dependence of (nu(g)), and allowed the determination of thermodynamic parameters deltaG0(app), V(app) and P(1/2). The results were consistent with a partial unfolding of the protein and not simply with dissociation of this dimeric enzyme. In the presence of polyols, the native conformation of beta-galactosidase was considerably more resistant to pressure. This protective effect of polyols is probably due to a reduced accessibility of water inside the protein structure, through the direct or indirect action of these additives on the enzyme.

TI  - Transdermal oestrogen reduces daytime blood pressure in hypertensive women [see comment]  
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of transdermally administered 17-beta-oestradiol on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive, postmenopausal women. Thirteen postmenopausal women with ongoing treatment for hypertension were included in this placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study. Ambulatory recordings of BP and heart rate were performed during 24 h on two occasions, separated by at least 1 week, after application of a patch containing either 100 microg per 24 h 17-beta-oestradiol or placebo. Serum oestradiol was increased (P<0.001) during active treatment (139.2 +/- 21.1 pg/ml) compared with the baseline postmenopausal levels recorded during placebo (40.5 +/- 2.2 pg/ml). No rise in BP was found in office BP or during ambulatory recordings.  Daytime BP pressure was acutely reduced by approximately 3 mm Hg during the 24 h of treatment with oestrogen (SBP n.s., DBP P<0.05), without any change in heart rate. Nocturnal dipping in SBP and DBP was present during placebo conditions, and there were no signs of an increase in dipping during treatment with 17-beta-oestradiol. This study supports previous evidence that hormone replacement therapy is safe in hypertensive women. The data in the present study also imply an acute, but small reduction of daytime BP due to transdermal oestrogen in hypertensive, postmenopausal women. Furthermore oestrogen did not blunt or increase the dipping phenomena during the night in these women.

TI  - Control of exposure to airborne viable microorganisms during remediation of moldy buildings; report of three case studies.  
AB  - Three different techniques for reducing exposure to microorganisms were tested during remediation of moldy buildings. Concentrations of spores (fungi and actinomycetes) were determined by filter sampling before, during, and after remediation. The local exhaust method used for asbestos dismantling was the most effective control method. In the construction zone, concentrations of microorganisms were 4-25 times higher during remediation than before it. In the adjacent area no increase in concentrations was seen. When the construction zone was placed under negative pressure with a fan and isolated with a plastic barrier, concentrations of microorganisms were about 100 times higher there during remediation work. Nevertheless, levels remained low in the adjacent area. The use of a portable exhaust fan with a side-draft hood decreased concentrations of fungi to one-tenth compared with demolition without the control technology. Furthermore, this method prevented the migration of fungal spores from the construction zone to the adjacent area, although it was less effective in prevention of actinomycete spore migration. It also decreased the levels of microorganisms in the construction zone below the preconstruction level within 2 hours. This study showed that levels of airborne microorganisms, including from the working area to adjacent area, can be reduced with commonly used dust control methods during demolition work. However, microorganism levels in the construction zone remained elevated. Therefore, personal protection of construction workers is needed even with control techniques.

TI  - Endolaryngeal contact pressures.  
AB  - In this work, we present a new method for in vivo endolaryngeal contact pressure measurement with a miniature pressure transducer. Using this methodology, contact pressures can be measured during videoendoscopy at different locations between the artyenoids and also at various locations along the membranous vocal folds. Twenty adults with organic and functional voice disorders and two vocally healthy adults participated as subjects. Endolaryngeal contact pressure measures were made during a series of phonatory tasks varying pitch, loudness, and phonatory onset and offset. Measures were also made during nonphonatory tasks, including throat clearing, coughing, Valsalva maneuvres, and gagging. The most remarkable findings were: (1) interarytenoid contact pressures were considerably greater than intraglottal contact pressures; (2) interarytenoid contact pressures were greater for lower than higher pitches; (3) both interarytenoid and intraglottal contact pressures were remarkably large during hard glottal attack; and (4) overall, the largest endolaryngeal pressures were recorded between the arytenoids, during a thoracic fixation maneuver and during gag reflex.

TI  - In vivo comparison of esophageal varices at and above the diaphragmatic high pressure zone using high resolution endoluminal sonography.  
AB  - Our objective in this study was to use high resolution endoluminal sonography to compare the size of esophageal varices within 5 cm of and at the esophageal high pressure zone. We carried out the study in 36 patients with endoscopically proven esophageal varices. A 20-MHz 6.2F ultrasound catheter was passed through a 34F endoscope and used to image esophageal varices as it was slowly withdrawn through the high pressure zone (the level at which the diaphragm was imaged) and into the body of the esophagus approximately 5 cm above the high pressure zone. All images were captured on videotape and reviewed by one of the investigators. The mean, total, and percent cross-sectional surface areas occupied by varices were calculated and then compared within 5 cm and at the esophageal high pressure zone. Six of 36 (17%) patients had no varices imaged at the high pressure zone but did have varices imaged in the distal esophagus. The mean cross-sectional surface area per varix at the high pressure zone (0.036+/-0.006 cm2) was significantly less (p < or = 0.0001) than the mean cross-sectional area per varix 5 cm above the high pressure zone (0.142+/-0.018 cm2). The average total cross-sectional surface area occupied by varices at the high pressure zone (0.137+/-0.034 cm2) was significantly less (p < 0.0001) than the average cross-sectional surface area occupied by varices 5 cm above the high pressure zone (0.672+/-0.080 cm2). The mean percent esophageal wall cross-sectional surface area occupied by varices at the high pressure zone (16%) was significantly less (p < or = 0.0001) than 5 cm above the high pressure zone (49%). We conclude that the mean, total, and percent cross-sectional surface areas of esophageal varices at the high pressure zone are significantly less than those 5 cm above the high pressure zone.

TI  - Effect of amlodipine versus felodipine extended release on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in hypertension.  
AB  - Amlodipine and felodipine are calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type. The elimination half-life of amlodipine is longer than that of felodipine. To study whether the different elimination rates of the drugs were reflected in different duration of blood pressure (BP) control, we compared amlodipine and felodipine extended release (ER) by both conventional clinic BP 24 h after drug intake and 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), with special reference to nighttime and morning blood pressure. Two hundred and sixteen patients with primary hypertension (supine diastolic BP, 95 to 115 mm Hg) were randomized to receive amlodipine or felodipine ER in a multicenter study. The starting dose of both drugs was 5 mg. If the target clinic diastolic BP (90 mm Hg) had not been achieved after 4 weeks the dose was increased to 10 mg. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was performed with the subjects taking placebo medication before randomization and after 4 and 8 weeks undergoing active treatment. Significantly more patients responded after 4 weeks of treatment with amlodipine (50%) as compared with felodipine (33%) (P = .013). ABPM during daytime (07:00 to 23:00) was similar during both treatments, but nighttime systolic (P = .026) and diastolic (P = .019) BP was more effectively reduced by amlodipine than by felodipine. After 8 weeks 82% achieved the target pressure with amlodipine and 69% with felodipine (P = .036 for the difference). Amlodipine seems to be more effective than felodipine when the drugs are compared in the same dose, with regard to the effect on clinic BP 24 h after dosing and to ambulatory BP during the night. The longer elimination half-life of amlodipine as compared to felodipine is the probable reason for this finding.

TI  - Protective effect of nisoldipine on dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia: correlation with exercise electrocardiography.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with strong coronary dilatative action, is commonly used in the treatment of myocardial ischaemia; its beneficial effect on effort angina has been demonstrated by several previous reports. Infusion of dipyridamole in doses sufficient to provoke myocardial ischaemia in patients with significant coronary artery disease is used safely in imaging studies for diagnostic purposes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential effect of nisoldipine on dipyridamole-induced ischaemia and to compare the results with the effect of nisoldipine on exercise-induced ischaemia. METHOD: Twelve patients (10 men and two women, mean age 62 +/- 8 years) with significant coronary artery disease (at least 70% lumen reduction in at least one major coronary vessel) were selected for inclusion in the study. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, the patients exhibited an ischaemic diagnostic response to a multistage exercise electrocardiography stress test (> 0.15 mV ST segment depression compared with the resting electrocardiographic tracing) and to a dipyridamole-echocardiography test (transient left ventricular dyssynergy of contraction during infusion of dipyridamole up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10 min), after 3 days' cessation of antianginal treatment. After treatment with oral nisoldipine (10 mg twice daily) was introduced, the patients repeated the two tests, within 18 days of the first evaluation. RESULTS: The dipyridamole-echocardiography test was positive for ischaemia in 12 patients who were not receiving nisoldipine and in eight patients who were receiving the drug (100% and 67% respectively, P < 0.05). In the eight patients who gave positive dipyridamole-echocardiography tests both with and without treatment, dipyridamole time (time to onset of dyssynergy during the test) increased from 7.9 +/- 2.9 min to 10.2 +/- 3.1 min (P < 0.01). In these patients, no significant changes were observed, at ischaemia, in the severity and extent of induced dyssynergy, evaluated as wall motion score index (each of 16 left ventricular segments scored from 1 = normal to 4 = dyskinetic) after treatment (score variations from baseline to ischaemia: 0.20 +/- 0.11 without nisoldipine and 0.16 +/- 0.06 with nisoldipine; NS). Variations in dipyridamole time (arbitrarily considered to be 15 min in the negative dipyridamole-echocardiography test) were significantly correlated with variations in exercise time (duration of exercise to exhaustion or diagnostic positive response on the electrocardiogram): r = 0.75 (P < 0.01). No significant differences were recorded in rate-pressure product (beats/min x mmHg x 100) at peak ischaemia between patients who were or were not receiving nisoldipine, during either the exercise electrocardiography stress test (233 +/- 36 with nisoldipine and 244 +/- 39 without nisoldipine; NS) or the dipyridamole-echocardiography test (147 +/- 21 with nisoldipine and 133 +/- 30 without nisoldipine; NS). CONCLUSION: Nisoldipine treatment can protect from dipyridamole-induced ischaemia, being associated with a longer stress time, and completely preventing the development of ischaemia in some patients. The therapy-induced changes in ischaemic threshold during the dipyridamole-echocardiography test correlate with variations in exercise tolerance.

TI  - Effect of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate on principal neurons of the rat ventral tegmental area.  
AB  - Intracellular recordings were made in a midbrain slice preparation of the rat brain containing the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Dopaminergic principal cells were identified by their electrophysiological properties and their hyperpolarizing responses to dopamine. Superfusion with dopamine (100 microM) caused hyperpolarization and a decrease of the apparent input resistance. By contrast, two structural analogues of ATP, 2-methylthio ATP (2-MeSATP; 10 microM) and alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha, beta-meATP; 30 microM) had no effect, when added to the superfusion medium.  Pressure applied dopamine also hyperpolarized the membrane, while both 2-MeSATP and alpha,beta-meATP were ineffective. Hence, dopaminergic principal neurons of the VTA do not possess somatic P2 purinoceptors present on peripheral and central noradrenergic neurons. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - The combined effect of high hydrostatic pressure and mild heat on inactivation of pathogens in milk and poultry.  
AB  - The combined effects of high hydrostatic pressure and heat on the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC 12079 and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10652 in poultry meat and ultra-high-temperature-treated (UHT) milk were investigated. The to have a significant effect on the survival of the pathogens during treatment. For E. coli O157:H7, a 15-min treatment of 400 MPa at 50 degrees C resulted in approximately a 6.0-log10 reduction in CFU/g in poultry meat and a 5.0-log10 reduction in UHT milk; however, a < 1-log10 reduction was achieved with either treatment alone. In contrast, for S. aureus, a 15-min treatment of 500 MPa at 50 degrees C was required to achieve a 5.0-log10 reduction in poultry meat and a 6.0-log10 reduction in UHT milk. As before, a < 1-log10 reduction in numbers was achieved with either treatment alone.  The pressure-temperature inactivation curves of each organism, in each substrate, were fitted using the Gompertz equation. Polynomial expression derived from the Gompertz variables were used to devise simple models which predicted the inactivation of each pathogen at various pressure-temperature combinations. Thus, a number of different pressure-temperature conditions could be chosen to achieve a desired inactivation level. The use of such models will provide flexibility in selecting optimum pressure conditions without compromising microbiological safety.

TI  - Importance of cutaneous postural reflex vasoconstriction in patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to measure the cutaneous postural vasoconstrictive reflex (PVR) in normal controls and patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities, and to determine its diagnostic and prognostic relevance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The postural vasoconstrictive reflex was recorded in 34 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower limbs and 27 normal controls, using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Patients also had ankle and toe pressure measurements and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2). SETTING: University hospital. RESULTS: The PVR on the pulp of the big toe was 20+/-7 arbitrary perfusion units in normal controls, 9.4+/-12 in patients with claudication, and -19 +/- 5 in patients with rest pain and/or gangrene, who differed from the claudicant and control groups (p=0.001 and 0.0001 respectively). The sensitivity of negative PVR in the big toe was 89% for the diagnosis of rest pain and/or gangrene, and its specificity, 83%. The severity of foot ischaemia and PVR values exhibited a significant inverse correlation (r=-0.56, p<0.0001). All patients with a poor outcome, ie. death and/or major amputation within 100 days of follow-up, had a negative PVR, and all patients with a positive PVR had a good 100-day prognosis without even a minor amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Laser-Doppler provides useful additional information in the assessment of foot ischaemia severity by showing that postural vasoconstriction is impaired in patients with severe atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower limbs, resulting in increased skin microcirculatory flow during leg dependency.

TI  - Patterns of glaucoma medication use in urban and rural Victoria.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to describe patterns of glaucoma medication use among people who self-report a history of glaucoma in a population-based study of age-related eye disease. METHODS: The present study was comprised of a population-based cluster stratified sample of 5000 Victorians aged 40 years and older. Participants completed an interview regarding demographic characteristics, medical history and use of medications. Participants also completed orthoptic and dilated fundus examinations, including measurement of intra-occular pressure (IOP) and visual fields. Glaucoma history and use of glaucoma medication was self reported. Glaucoma disease status was confirmed by a specialist consensus group. RESULTS: The most common glaucoma medications used were beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (63%), followed by sympathomimetics (18%) and cholinergic agents (16%). There were no differences in glaucoma medication use by gender, age, years since diagnosis, rural or urban residence or a history of glaucoma surgery. Among participants using medication, 16.1% exceeded 21 mmHg IOP. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of the use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent medication reflects the shift from the use of pilocarpine over the past 20 years. The prevalence of IOP greater than 21 mmHg highlights the difficulty in managing high IOP.

TI  - Luminal cross-sectional area and tension-strain relation of the porcine bile duct.  
AB  - The bile duct is a distensible tube serving to transport bile from the liver and gallbladder to the duodenum. The purpose of this study was to characterize the luminal cross-sectional area (CSA) and tension-strain properties during distension of the normal isolated porcine common bile duct in vitro. An impedance planimetric system located inside a balloon was used. Eleven porcine bile ducts were examined in two locations, in the hepatic duct and in the common bile duct. The CSAs obtained in the common bile duct were significantly higher than those in the hepatic duct in the pressure range 0-8 kPa (P < 0.001). The circumferential wall tension (T)-strain (epsilon) relations for both locations fitted to the exponential equation T = a.eb. epsilon with determination coefficients of 0.97 +/- 0.01. The a and b constants were not statistically different between the two locations indicating that the elastic properties did not differ. In conclusion, the luminal CSAs were larger in the common bile duct when compared to the hepatic duct and the tension-strain relations did not differ between the two segments of the bile duct.

TI  - Respiratory sinus dysrhythmia persists in transplanted human hearts following autonomic blockade.  
AB  - 1. The present study was performed to test whether beat-to-beat cardiovascular control in cardiac allograft recipients resides in cholinergic and/or adrenergic nerves that are intrinsic to the heart. 2. Heart rate (HR) fluctuations synchronous with respiration during spontaneous, double tidal volume and metronome-synchronized breathing were quantified in 13 human heart transplant recipients. We also examined the effects of sequential cholinergic and beta-adrenoceptor (combined) autonomic blockade on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). We computed RSA amplitude and the correlation between respiration and changes in HR (cardiopulmonary synchronization; CPS). Group means were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Transplant recipients served as their own controls. 3. In the basal state, moderate RSA amplitude and CPS were observed. During cholinergic and combined blockade, we observed no significant change in RSA amplitude, whereas CPS increased significantly during combined blockade (P < 0.05). The amplitude of RSA increased during respiration at double baseline tidal volume, but not at any of the other breathing manoeuvres (P < 0.01). In contrast, CPS increased significantly during both patterned breathing manoeuvres. No significant correlation was seen between mean right atrial pressure and RSA amplitude. In 23% of subjects with low CPS, HR oscillated with arterial pressure. These oscillations were independent of respiration. During all three patterns of respiration, a significant inverse correlation was observed between CPS and pulse pressure (r = -0.53 to -0.73). Thus, as the amplitude of pulse pressure increased, respiration accounted for a smaller percentage of HR variation. 4. In conclusion, RSA persists and the magnitude of CPS increases following combined autonomic blockade. These studies suggest that while RSA after cardiac transplantation is not cholinergically or adrenergically mediated, it may be related to mechanical stretch of the sinus node caused by changes in intrathoracic pressure and perfusion pressure.

TI  - Diphenylhydramine increases ventilatory drive during alfentanil infusion.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diphenhydramine is used as an antipruritic and antiemetic in patients receiving opioids. Whether it might exacerbate opioid-induced ventilatory depression has not been determined. METHODS: The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide during hyperoxia and the ventilatory response to hypoxia during hypercapnia (end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide [PETCO2] is approximately equal to 54 mmHg) were determined in eight healthy volunteers. Ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and hypoxia were calculated at baseline and during an alfentanil infusion (estimated blood levels approximately equal to 10 ng/ml) before and after diphenhydramine 0.7 mg/kg. RESULTS: The slope of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide decreased from 1.08+/-0.38 to 0.79+/-0.36 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1) (x +/- SD, P < 0.05) during alfentanil infusion; after diphenhydramine, the slope increased to 1.17+/-0.28 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1) (P < 0.05). The minute ventilation (VE) at PETCO2 approximately equal to 46 mmHg (VE46) decreased from 12.1+/-3.7 to 9.7+/-3.6 l/min (P < 0.05) and the VE at 54 mmHg (VE54) decreased from 21.3+/-4.8 to 16.6+/-4.7 l/min during alfentanil (P < 0.05). After diphenhydramine, (VE46 did not change significantly, remaining lower than baseline at 9.9+/-2.9 l/min (P < 0.05), whereas VE54 increased significantly to 20.5+/-3.0 l/min. During hypoxia, VE at SpO2 = 90% (VE90) decreased from 30.5+/-9.7 to 23.1+/-6.9 l/min during alfentanil (P < 0.05). After diphenhydramine, the increase in VE90 to 27.2+/-9.2 l/min was not significant (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Diphenhydramine counteracts the alfentanil-induced decrease in the slope of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. However, at PETCO2 = 46 mmHg, it does not significantly alter the alfentanil-induced shift in the carbon dioxide response curve. In addition, diphenhydramine does not exacerbate the opioid-induced depression of the hypoxic ventilatory response during moderate hypercarbia.

TI  - Capillary blood pressure in syngeneic rat islets transplanted under the renal capsule is similar to that of the implantation organ.  
AB  - The aim of the present study was to measure capillary blood pressure and interstitial pressure in transplanted pancreatic islets and to correlate these measurements to capillary and tubular pressures in the adjacent kidney. For this purpose, 250 syngeneic islets were implanted under the renal capsule of WF rats and studied 1, 2, or 6 months after transplantation. Some of the animals studied after 1 and 2 months were streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic. Measurements were performed during basal conditions or after an acute glucose-stimulation of insulin release. The hydrostatic pressures were determined in vivo by direct micropuncture. The islet transplant capillary pressure in normoglycemic animals was 6.9 +/- 0.4 mmHg (n = 9), 10.0 +/- 0.8 mmHg (n = 7), and 12.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg (n = 7) when measured 1, 2, and 6 months after implantation, respectively. Previous data from our laboratory showed that the normal capillary pressure of native rat pancreatic islets is approximately 3 mmHg. The blood pressure in kidney peritubular capillaries was 10-12 mmHg in both transplanted and control animals. Islet transplant interstitial pressures were 4-6 mmHg in the normoglycemic recipients at 1, 2, and 6 months after transplantation. Acute glucose stimulation had no effect on islet transplant interstitial pressure or peritubular or transplant capillary blood pressures. Capillary pressures in the islet grafts were slightly increased 1 month after transplantation in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and this was associated with an increased blood perfusion of the transplants. However, 2 months after transplantation there were no differences in transplant capillary blood pressure between diabetic and normoglycemic animals.  The graft interstitial pressure was, on the contrary, decreased in the diabetic animals 2 months after transplantation. We concluded that the capillary blood pressure in islets implanted under the renal capsule was similar to that of the implantation organ, which was three to four times higher than that normally found in native islets.

METHODS: Among 22 normotensive, healthy volunteers the AST were tested by applying pressure values between 0 and 100 mm Hg and measuring the intracompartmental pressure, the muscular oxygen pressure as well as the MRP by electroneurographic means within a period of 6 hours. RESULTS: The median initial intracompartmental pressure value of the m. tibialis anterior was 12.0 mm Hg (Q25%/Q75%: 8.9/17.3), the muscular oxygen pressure 14.8 mm Hg (Q25%/Q75%: 11.5/22.0). Transmission of the pneumatic AST-leg segment pressure to the muscle: 97.7% (Q25%/Q75%: 89.2/99.8). Already in the low AST pressure field (20-40 mm Hg) a severe hypoxia occurred in one case. A reduction of MRP was noticed at an AST pressure rate of 10 mm Hg. In 5 of 6 cases AST pressure values of 60 mm Hg led to pathological pO2-values within 5-20 minutes. Almost without exception AST-pressure rates < 60 mm Hg resulted in an anoxia of the muscle and loss of the MRP. CONCLUSIONS: We should demand that the AST are only applied with models where the pressure generated within the single segments can be controlled by pressure gauge. The application of the AST seems to be justified for polytraumatised in severe haemorrhagic shock where the risk of a local tissue ischemia with systemical consequences must deliberately be accepted.

TI  - Plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels increase in proportion to the extent of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the influence of right ventricular (RV) hemodynamic variables and function on the secretion of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with isolated RV overload. BACKGROUND: Plasma BNP is known to increase in proportion to the degree of left ventricular (LV) overload. However, whether BNP secretion is also regulated in the presence of RV overload remains unknown. METHODS: Plasma BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels in the pulmonary artery were measured in 44 patients with RV overload: 18 with RV volume overload (RVVO) due to atrial septal defect and 26 with RV pressure overload (RVPO) due to primary or thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization was performed in all patients. RV and LV ejection fraction, myocardial mass and volume of the four chambers were determined by using electron beam computed tomography. RESULTS: Although both plasma BNP and ANP levels were significantly elevated in patients with RV overload compared with values in control subjects, plasma BNP and the BNP/ANP ratio were significantly higher in patients with RVPO than with RVVO (BNP 294 +/- 72 vs. 48 +/- 14 pg/ml; BNP/ANP 1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.2, both p < 0.05). Plasma BNP correlated positively with mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.73), total pulmonary resistance (r = 0.79), mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.79), RV end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.76) and RV myocardial mass (r = 0.71); it correlated negatively with cardiac output (r = -0.33) and RV ejection fraction (r = -0.71). Plasma BNP significantly decreased from 315 +/- 120 to 144 +/- 54 pg/ml with long-term vasodilator therapy (total pulmonary resistance decreased from 23 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 3 Wood U). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BNP increases in proportion to the extent of RV dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension.

TI  - 13th Meeting of the Scientific Group on Methodologies for the Safety Evaluation of Chemicals (SGOMSEC): alternative testing methodologies for ecotoxicity.  
AB  - There is growing public pressure to minimize the use of vertebrates in ecotoxicity testing; therefore, effective alternatives to toxicity tests causing suffering are being sought. This report discusses alternatives and differs in some respects from the reports of the other three groups because the primary concern is with harmful effects of chemicals at the level of population and above rather than with harmful effects upon individuals. It is concluded that progress toward the objective of minimizing testing that causes suffering would be served by the following initiatives--a clearer definition of goals and strategies when undertaking testing procedures; development of alternative assays, including in vitro test systems, that are based on new technology; development of nondestructive assays for vertebrates (e.g., biomarkers) that do not cause suffering; selection of most appropriate species, strains, and developmental stages for testing procedures (but no additional species for basic testing); better integrated and more flexible testing procedures incorporating biomarker responses, ecophysiological concepts, and ecological end points (progress in this direction depends upon expert judgment). In general, testing procedures could be made more realistic, taking into account problems with mixtures, and with volatile or insoluble chemicals.

TI  - The effect of pneumoperitoneum on intraocular pressure in rabbits with alpha-chymotrypsin-induced glaucoma.  
AB  - Increased intraperitoneal pressure is associated with physiological changes including alterations of intraocular pressure (IOP). We have previously shown that IOP is not adversely affected by increased intraperitoneal pressure up to 15 mm Hg in women with no preexisting eye disease. The aim of this study was to measure IOP changes associated with increased intraperitoneal pressure (up to 15 mm Hg) of 2 h duration in 12 rabbits with alpha-chymotrypsin-induced glaucoma. A reliable model of glaucoma was created by injecting alpha-chymotrypsin into the posterior chamber of the right eye in 12 rabbits. Thereafter, 5 of the 12 rabbits with glaucomatous eyes were treated with topical timolol. The left eye was used as a control. During pentobarbital general anesthesia, increased intraperitoneal pressure up to 15 mm Hg was created by intraperitoneal CO2 insufflation. Body temperature and expired CO2 were kept constant throughout the study. IOP measurements were made using an electronic pneumotonometer. IOP, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure were recorded in head-up and head-down positions before, during, and after increased intraperitoneal pressure. The IOP of both eyes, in both treated and untreated rabbits, increased significantly from baseline only when increased intraperitoneal pressure associated with the head-down position resulted in a significant increase in central venous pressure. However, the IOP increase remained within the diurnal range. The major finding of this study is that, in a reliable model of glaucoma, CO2 pneumoperitoneum was associated with an increase in IOP when a head-down position was combined with pneumoperitoneum. Implications: In rabbits with alpha-chymotrypsin-induced glaucoma, increased intraperitoneal pressure (up to 15 mm Hg) resulted in a significant intraocular pressure increase when pneumoperitoneum was associated with the head-down position. However, the intraocular pressure increase remained within the diurnal range.

TI  - Intramedullary pressure in syringomyelia: clinical and pathophysiological correlates of syrinx distension [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiological effects of syrinx distension are incompletely understood. Although it is generally assumed that the accumulation of fluid within syrinx cavities can contribute to neurological dysfunction, there are no reports describing intramedullary pressure in syringomyelia. The purpose of the current study was to measure syrinx pressures in patients with progressive clinical deterioration and to correlate these data with neurological deficits and intraoperative physiological findings. METHODS: Intramedullary fluid pressure was measured manometrically in 32 patients undergoing syrinx shunting procedures. The data were correlated with syrinx morphology, intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials, laser Doppler measurements of local spinal cord blood flow (six patients), and neurological findings before and after syrinx decompression. RESULTS: Syrinx pressures recorded under atmospheric conditions ranged from 0.5 to 22.0 cm H2O (mean = 7.7 cm). There was a significant elevation of the cardiac pulse (mean = 0.7 cm H2O) and the respiratory pulse (mean = 1.1 cm H2O) that was consistent with raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Syrinx pressures decreased to subatmospheric levels after surgical drainage. In 18 of 24 patients with predrainage somatosensory evoked potential abnormalities, syrinx decompression produced a consistent reduction of N20 latencies (mean change = 0.49 ms +/- 0.094 SE right, P = 0.002; 0.61 ms +/- 0.089 SE left, P = 0.001) and a similar but less consistent increase in N20 amplitudes (mean change = 0.17 mV +/- 0.103 SE right, P = 0.115; 0.31 mV +/- 0.097 SE left, P = 0.027). Measurements of local spinal cord blood flow revealed very low baseline values (mean = 12.2 arbitrary units +/- 13.9 standard deviation), which increased to intermediate levels (mean = 144.7 arbitrary units +/- 42.6 standard deviation) after syrinx decompression. Patients with syrinx pressures greater than 7.7 cm H2O tended to have more rapidly progressive symptoms, exhibited greater improvements after shunting, and had a higher incidence of postoperative dysesthetic pain. CONCLUSION: The current study is the first to measure intramedullary pressure in a human disease. Evidence is presented that distended syringes are associated with varying levels of raised intramedullary pressure that can accentuate or induce neurological dysfunction by the compression of long tracts, neurons, and the microcirculation. Symptoms referrable to raised intramedullary pressure are potentially reversible by syrinx decompression.

RESULTS: In all 21 cases of unexpected death associated with excited delirium, the deaths were associated with restraint (for violent agitation and hyperactivity), with the person either in a prone position (18 people [86%]) or subjected to pressure on the neck (3 [14%]).

TI  - Unexpected death related to restraint for excited delirium: a retrospective study of deaths in police custody and in the community [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some people in states of excited delirium die while in police custody. Emerging evidence suggests that physical restraint in certain positions may contribute to such deaths. In this study the authors determined the frequency of physical restraint among people in a state of excited delirium who died unexpectedly. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 21 cases of unexpected death in people with excited delirium, which were investigated by the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario between 1988 and 1995. Eyewitness testimony, findings during postmortem examinations, clinical history, toxicological data and other official documents describing the events surrounding the deaths were analyzed. Specific reference was made to documented eyewitness testimony of restraint method, body position and use of capsicum oleoresin (pepper) spray. Because cocaine was detected in the blood of some of these people during the postmortem examination, the role of cocaine in excited delirium was examined by comparing the cocaine levels in these cases with levels in 2 control groups: 19 people who died from acute cocaine intoxication and 21 people who had used cocaine shortly before they died but who had died from other causes. RESULTS: In all 21 cases of unexpected death associated with excited delirium, the deaths were associated with restraint (for violent agitation and hyperactivity), with the person either in a prone position (18 people [86%]) or subjected to pressure on the neck (3 [14%]). All of those who died had suddenly lapsed into tranquillity shortly after being restrained. The excited delirium was caused by a psychiatric disorder in 12 people (57%) and by cocaine-induced psychosis in 8 (38%). Eighteen people (86%) were in police custody when they died. Four (19%) had been sprayed with capsicum oleoresin, and heart disease was found in another 4 at autopsy. The blood level of cocaine in those whose excited delirium was cocaine induced was similar to levels found in recreational cocaine users and lower than levels found in people who died from cocaine intoxication. INTERPRETATION: Restraint may contribute to the death of people in states of excited delirium, and further studies to test this hypothesis are recommended. Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities and others should bear in mind the potential for the unexpected death of people in states of excited delirium who are restrained in the prone position or with a neck hold.

TI  - The effect of propofol on systemic vascular resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass: a comparative study with thiopentone.  
AB  - 30 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were allocated randomly to receive either propofol--2.5mg/kg--(N = 10, Group I) or thiopentone--4mg/kg--(N = 10, Group II) during cardiopulmonary bypass with constant pump flow and temperature. Two groups and another control group-receiving no medication-(N = 10, Group III) were compared with respect to the changes in hemodynamic parameters, especially systemic vascular resistance (SVR). After propofol, SVR decreased from 2489 +/- 302 to 1594 +/- 286 dyn sec cm-5 and remained significantly less than the control values until 16.6 +/- 4 min. after the administration of propofol. Following thiopentone administration, SVR decreased from 2653 +/- 298 to 2162 +/- 279 dyn sec cm-5 and remained so for the following 9.4 +/- 3 min. There were more significant decreases in especially cardiac index, perfusion pressure and SVR in the propofol group compared with thiopentone or control groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass has been shown to be a useful model for studying the isolated effects of anesthetic drugs on hemodynamic parameters. In our study, we tried to discuss the mechanism of the hypotensive effects of anesthetic agents, especially propofol and give an idea about the possible precautions that should be taken.
