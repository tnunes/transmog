TI  - Mitral balloon valvuloplasty in pregnancy: limiting radiation and procedure time by using transesophageal echocardiography.  
AB  - A 35-year-old female with mitral stenosis was admitted to hospital in her 23rd week of gestation for management of disabling dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was in New York Heart Association functional class III and underwent successful percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty with significant improvement of her symptoms. To limit radiation exposure and procedure time, transesophageal echocardiography was used in combination with pulsed fluoroscopy. The remainder of her pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy baby at 38 weeks' gestation.

TI  - Virally directed cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine gene therapy enhances radiation response in human cancer xenografts.  
AB  - Gene therapy combined with radiation therapy to enhance selectively radiation cytotoxicity in malignant cells represents a new approach for cancer treatment. We investigated the efficacy of adenoviral (Ad5)-directed cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine (CD/5-FC) enzyme/prodrug gene therapy to enhance selectively the tumoricidal action of ionizing radiation in human cancer xenografts derived from a human squamous carcinoma cell line (SQ-20B). Tumor xenografts grown in hindlimbs of nude mice were transfected with an adenoviral vector (Ad.CMV.CD) containing the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Mice were injected i.p. with 800 mg/kg of 5-FC for 12 days, and tumors were treated with fractionated radiation at a dose of 5 Gy/day to a total dose of 50 Gy. In larger tumors with a mean volume of 1069 mm3, marked tumor regression to 11% of the original tumor volume was observed at day 21 (P = 0.01). The volumetric regression of smaller tumors with a mean volume of 199 mm3, which received the same combined treatment protocol, was significant at day 12 (P = 0.014). However, unlike large tumors, regression of the smaller tumors continued until day 36 (P = 0.01), with 43% cured at day 26. No cures or significant volumetric reduction in size was observed in tumors treated with radiation alone; Ad.CMV.CD with or without radiation; or with Ad.CMV.CD and 5-FC. These results suggest that the CD/5-FC gene therapy approach is an effective radiosensitizing strategy and may lead to substantial improvement in local tumor control that would translate into improved cure rates and better survival.

TI  - Radiotherapy during pregnancy: effects on fetuses and neonates.  
AB  - To optimize the efficacy of radiotherapy for cancer patients who are pregnant, the following factors must be considered: the potential effects of the therapy on fetuses and neonates, the stage and prognosis of the mother's disease, and the possible risks to the patient of restricting cancer treatment. Malformations and mental retardation are the most serious consequences of fetal exposure to radiation that are observed after birth. The sensitivity to radiation is high from 2 to 8 weeks after conception for malformations and from 8 to 25 weeks (particularly up to week 15) for mental retardation; the risk of mental retardation declines rapidly after the 25th week of gestation. When a pregnant patient requires radiation therapy, the physician should consider fetal sensitivity to radiation in light of gestational age and the expected dose of radiation and should then calculate the risk to the fetus versus the benefits to the mother. The risk is negligible if fetal exposure does not exceed 0.1 Gy, preferably remaining below 0.05 Gy, during gestation. Furthermore, it is safest to administer radiotherapy during or after the 25th week of gestation.

TI  - Latent transforming growth factor beta1 activation in situ: quantitative and functional evidence after low-dose gamma-irradiation.  
AB  - The biological activity of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta) is controlled by its secretion as a latent complex in which it is noncovalently associated with latency-associated peptide (LAP). Activation is the extracellular process in which TGF-beta is released from LAP, and is considered to be a primary regulatory control. We recently reported rapid and persistent changes in TGF-beta immunoreactivity in conjunction with extracellular matrix remodeling in gamma-irradiated mouse mammary gland. Our hypothesis is that these specific changes in immunoreactivity are indicative of latent TGF-beta activation. In the present study, we determined the radiation dose response and tested whether a functional relationship exists between radiation-induced TGF-beta and collagen type III remodeling. After radiation exposures as low as 0.1 Gy, we detected increased TGF-beta immunoreactivity in the mammary epithelium concomitant with decreased LAP immunostaining, which are events consistent with activation. Quantitative image analysis demonstrated a significant (P=0.0005) response at 0.1 Gy without an apparent threshold and a linear dose response to 5 Gy. However, in the adipose stroma, loss of LAP demonstrated a qualitative threshold at 0.5 Gy. Loss of LAP paralleled induction of collagen III immunoreactivity in this tissue compartment. We tested whether TGF-beta mediates collagen III expression by treating animals with TGF-beta panspecific monoclonal antibody, 1D11.16, administered i.p. shortly before irradiation. Radiation-induced collagen III staining in the adipose stroma was blocked in an antibody dose-dependent manner, which persisted through 7 days postirradiation. RNase protection assay revealed that radiation-induced elevation of total gland collagen III mRNA was also blocked by neutralizing antibody treatment. These data provide functional confirmation of the hypothesis that radiation exposure leads to latent TGF-beta activation, support our interpretation of the reciprocal shift in immunoreactivity as evidence of activation, and implicate TGF-beta as a mediator of tissue response to ionizing radiation. The sensitivity of activation to low radiation doses points to a potential role for TGF-beta in orchestrating tissue response to oxidative stress. As such, radiation may be useful as a probe to delineate the consequences of latent TGF-beta activation in situ.

TI  - [Re-establishment of effective radiation dose to personnel of a radioactive waste utilizing plant]  
AB  - The radiation dose of incorporated cesium-137 was estimated in the workers of a radioactive waste-utilizing plant. For this, methods were developed to retrospectively estimate the dose of internal radiation from the data available in the archives on the body's cesium levels obtained through mass indicator monitoring. The methods were based on the theoretical considerations and variations of inhaled radionuclide intake. The average rhythm of inhalant intake was restored by 891 measurements made in 490 workers to calculate radiation levels in 1977-1995. The individual effective doses of internal radiation of the staff with cesium-137, which were accumulated by 1995 in the persons who began to work at the plant in 1997, were no greater than 1437 muSv and failed to be as high as 1% of the maximum acceptable dose in all cases.

TI  - Prevention of radiation induced taste aversion in rats.  
AB  - Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, and a cardiovascular therapeutic agent offers significant protection to mice against lethal dose of ionizing radiation. Considering the potential efficacy of diltiazem as a radioprotector for human use, it was deemed necessary to investigate its influence on radiation-induced behavioural changes like nausea, vomiting, learning, memory and performance. In the present studies, conditioned taste aversion (CTA) test based on consumption of saccharin solution, was used as a marker of behavioural changes. Significant CTA (97 +/- 2%) was observed in rats irradiated with Co-60 gamma rays (absorbed dose 1 Gy). Administration of diltiazem at doses greater than 10 mg/kg, body wt, evoked CTA in a dose-dependent manner and that was found to be further aggravated on irradiation. At a lower dose of 5 mg/kg, body wt, diltiazem did not evoke CTA and protected against radiation induced aversion significantly (62 +/- 3%). The results suggest that diltiazem at concentrations lower than 10 mg/kg, body wt, in rats may be useful in preventing radiation induced behavioural changes. This observation could be of particular significance in clinical radiotherapy where radiation induced nausea and vomiting are of great concern.

TI  - Resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in Bcl-2-expressing cells is reversed by depleting cellular thiols.  
AB  - The mechanism by which Bcl-2 oncogene expression inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis has been investigated in two mouse lymphoma cell lines: line LY-as is radiation sensitive, displays substantial radiaton-induced apoptosis, and expresses low levels of Bcl-2; line LY-ar is radiation-resistant, displays a low apoptosis propensity, and expresses 30-fold higher amount of Bcl-2 protein than does the sensitive line. We observed that upon incubation in cystine/methionine-free (C/M-) medium, radiation-induced apoptosis in the LY-ar cells was restored to levels comparable to that seen in the LY-as cells. lntracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in LY-ar cells incubated in C/M- medium plummeted to 50% of control values within 2 h. LY-ar cells treated with diethyl maleate (DEM) or diamide, agents that deplete cellular thiols, had increased susceptibility to radiation-induced apoptosis in a manner similar to C/M- medium. These results are consistent with the general idea that Bcl-2 expression blocks apoptosis through an antioxidant pathway that involves cellular thiols. That Bcl-2-expressing tumor cells can be sensitized by exogeneous agents that modify cellular thiols offers strategies for overcoming such resistance.

TI  - Biodosimetry results from space flight Mir-18.  
AB  - Astronauts are classified as radiation workers due to the presence of ionizing radiation in space. For the assessment of health risks, physical dosimetry has been indispensable. However, the change of the location of dosimeters on the crew members, the variation in dose rate with location inside the spacecraft and the unknown biological effects of microgravity can introduce significant uncertainties in estimating exposure. To circumvent such uncertainty, a study on the cytogenetic effects of space radiation in human lymphocytes was proposed and conducted for Mir-18, a 115-day mission. This study used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome painting probes to score chromosomal exchanges and the Giemsa staining method to determine the frequency of dicentrics. The growth kinetics of cells and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were examined to ensure that chromosomal aberrations were scored in the first mitosis and were induced primarily by space radiation. Our results showed that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased significantly in postflight samples compared to samples drawn prior to flight, and that the frequency of SCEs was similar for both pre- and postflight samples. Based on a dose-response curve for preflight samples exposed to gamma rays, the absorbed dose received by crew members during the mission was estimated to be about 14.75 cSv. Because the absorbed dose measured by physical dosimeters is 5.2 cGy for the entire mission, the RBE is about 2.8.

A 20-year-old girl presented with neck pain and new significant neurological deficits 17 years after resection of a posterior fossa medullomyoblastoma and subsequent craniospinal irradiation. She was found to have a cervical intramedullary tumor that was resected using a standard microsurgical technique. The permanent histopathological diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma. Her neurological status was worse immediately following the operation. She improved to her pre-operative status, but then had a relentless neurological decline resulting in death 16 weeks following surgery.

AB  - Effects of Pb2+, Ni2+, Hg2+ and Se4+ on cultured human glioma U-343MG cells were investigated considering uptake, toxicity and, in combination with radiation, clonogenic cells survival. The cells were exposed to 0-100 microM of the metals for a week before the evaluation. The tests showed a tendency to toxicity with 10 microM nickel although not significant (P > 0.05). Selenium, lead and mercury exerted a significant toxicity (P < 0.05) at 2.5 microM, 10 microM and 1 microM, respectively. To challenge the clonogenic cell survival capacity, the cells were irradiated with 60Co photons after being exposed to the highest nontoxic concentration of the different metals. The clonogenic cell survival tests, after irradiation, showed no significant change if the cells were exposed to 5 microM nickel, 0.5 microM selenium or 5 microM lead compared with those not exposed. Mercury, 0.1 microM, gave a relative reduction in survival compared with only irradiated cells of 58 +/- 17%. Thus, only mercury affected the radiation-induced damage and/or repair. When exposed to the highest nontoxic concentrations of the different metals, the cultures did not display a significant uptake ratio (metal concentration ratio of exposed cells to control cells) of nickel (3.1 +/- 3.3), only a small uptake ratio of selenium (4.0 +/- 0.4), while there was a large uptake ratio of both lead (2.6 +/- 1.7) x 10(2) and mercury (1.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(1). The results indicated that nickel was neither especially toxic nor influenced the clonogenic cell survival after irradiation. Mercury was more toxic and also influenced the radiation sensitivity. Lead was taken up strongly but did not influence the radiation sensitivity. Selenium accumulated but gave no detectable effect on the radiation sensitivity.

TI  - [Chemoradiation therapy for esophageal carcinoma]  
AB  - Cancer of the esophagus poses a great challenge to the surgical, medical, and radiation professions. Despite standardization of resection and reconstruction techniques, extended lymph node dissection, and advances in perioperative management, the overall prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer undergoing surgical resection has not improved. Preoperative combination chemoradiation therapy in patients with squamous cell esophageal carcinoma has recently received increasing attention, because preoperative chemoradiation therapy, consisting of the concurrent combination of 5-fluorouracil, cis-platinum and radiation, appears to increase the resection rate, the rate of pathological complete responders, and survival time after esophagectomy in patients with locally advanced tumors. Overall in the trials using preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, major antitumor responses have been reported in 40% to 80% of patients, and, consistently, up to 42.1% pathologic complete responses have been seen at esophagectomy. Therefore, preoperative chemoradiation therapy can be anticipated for better prognosis of the patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

TI  - Cervical cancer.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide physicians and the general public with a responsible assessment of current screening, prevention, and treatment approaches to cervical cancer. PARTICIPANTS: A non-Federal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel representing the fields of obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, radiation oncology, and epidemiology. In addition, 28 experts in obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, radiation oncology, gynecologic surgery, and psychology presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 500. EVIDENCE: The literature was searched through Medline and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and the conference audience. Experts prepared abstracts with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement that was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. CONCLUSIONS: Carcinoma of the cervix is causally related to infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Reducing the rate of HPV infection by changes in sexual behaviors in young people and/or through the development of an effective HPV vaccine would reduce the incidence of this disease. Pap smear screening remains the best available method of reducing the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer. Persons with stage IA1 disease have a high cure rate with either simple hysterectomy or, where fertility preservation is an issue, by cone biopsy with clear margins. For patients with other stage I and stage IIA disease, radical surgery and radiation are equally effective treatments. These patients should be carefully selected to receive one treatment or the other but not both, as their combined use substantially increases the cost and morbidity of treatment. Women with more advanced, nonmetastatic disease should be treated with radiation. Recurrent cervical cancer confined to the pelvis should be treated with the modality not previously received.  Radiation is recommended to palliate symptoms in patients with metastatic disease.

TI  - A case of malignant pleural mesothelioma following exposure to atomic radiation in Nagasaki.  
AB  - We report the case of a 75-year-old Japanese man who developed malignant mesothelioma in the left hemithorax 50 years after the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. This may be the first reported case of malignant mesothelioma following exposure to atomic radiation. Asbestos is the leading cause of malignant mesothelioma, but radiation therapy is the primary non-asbestos-related cause. In the case of radiation therapy, the interval between exposure and the occurrence of malignant mesothelioma tends to be many years. This patient was at a high risk of malignant mesothelioma as he had been exposed to radiation from the atomic bomb and may also have had a history of asbestos exposure at the munitions factory where he was employed as a shipbuilder for 2 years. It has been suggested that combined exposure to atomic radiation and asbestos is associated with an increased incidence of malignant mesothelioma. If thickening of the pleura or pleural effusion is found in atomic bomb survivors, malignant mesothelioma should be considered as one of the options in the differential diagnosis, even although the atomic bomb attacks occurred several decades ago.

TI  - An open clinical trial of a new mouth-PUVA variant in the treatment of oral lichenoid lesions.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of topical psoralen PUVA (sensitization in photosensitizing psoralen drug + UVA radiation) treatment of oral lichenoid lesions (OLL). STUDY DESIGN: A total of 16 patients with OLL were treated using a 0.01% trioxsalen ointment and UVA doses in the 0.09 to 1.80 J/cm2 range. The average number of sessions was 8.7 and a mean cumulative irradiation dose was 4.25 J/cm2. RESULTS: A marked-to-complete healing occurred in 3 to 16 (19%) patients immediately after therapy, in 4 of 14 (29%) after 3 months, and in 5 of 14 (38%) after 14 months, respectively. Of the 16 subjects with OLL, five were diagnosed as oral lichen planus (OLP) and 11 were classified as oral lichenoid reaction (OLR). Post-PUVA amelioration rate in patients with genuine OLP (4 of 5, 80%) was superior to that in patients with OLR (1 of 9, 11%). CONCLUSION: Topical trioxsalen photosensitization can be used in mouth-PUVA treatment, and lichen planus is a main indication for this therapy.

TI  - Electron wedges for radiation therapy.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Brain tumors can be advantageously treated with electron over photon radiation, by exploiting the rapid fall-off in dose with depth. This advantage could be further enhanced by utilizing multiple electron beams. However, in some beam configurations, wedged dose profiles would be necessary for the dose uniformity. Unlike photons, shaped pieces of material placed in electron beam severely degrade the energy, give additional scattering and, therefore, are suboptimal. The purpose of this study was to create wedged electron fields, using intensity modulation. The combination of electron wedges enables a more uniform coverage of brain tumors with a reduced dose to normal tissue. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Intensity modulation was performed for 10 to 50 MeV electrons using a narrow scanning elementary beam of a racetrack Microtron accelerator, delivering radiation pulses with coordinates and intensities prescribed by a custom scan matrix. Dispensing more pulses (or longer pulses) within the field to increase the local dose, one can sharpen the penumbra at depth and generate wedged dose distributions of arbitrary angle as well as many other desired profiles. We modulated the electron beams, measured dose distributions using film in an anthropomorphic phantom, and compared the results with conventional techniques. RESULTS: Intensity modulation of electron beams decreases the 50-90% penumbra at depth by 40% and increases the flatness by 80%. Wedged profiles at depth can be created for any angle up to about 70 degrees, depending on the beam energy. Multiple modulated electron beams give smaller 20-70% but larger 70-100% isodose regions than photon beams. CONCLUSIONS: Electron beams can improve dose distributions in brain compared to the same number of photon beams, reducing the 20-70% isodoses region in normal tissue by 30%. Intensity modulation significantly improves the dose distribution from combined electron beams providing a sharper penumbra, better conformity, and reduced margin.

TI  - Hydrogen peroxide protects yeast cells from inactivation by ionizing radiation: a radiobiological paradox.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate mechanisms of the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with chloride-derived cytotoxins under steady-state irradiation conditions and to determine the effects on cell viability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Yeast cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to 60Co gamma-irradiation under different conditions. The colony-forming ability was determined. RESULTS: Irradiation of PBS produces H2O2 and HOCl simultaneously. Under slightly acidic conditions and low oxygen tension the yield of HOCl exceeds that of H2O2 while at physiological pH and normoxic conditions H2O2 exceeds HOCl. Both substances react with each other rapidly in a pH-dependent way, even during an irradiation that lasts several seconds. As HOCl is about 1000-fold more toxic than H2O2 to the strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in these experiments, it is evident that in an irradiation that produces more HOCl than H2O2 the radiation-induced damage will be large. If, in contrast, the cells are irradiated under conditions in which H2O2 production predominates, the damage will be small. One would therefore predict that addition of hydrogen peroxide to a cell suspension prior to irradiation should result in protection for suspended cells if H2O2 interferes with the generation of HOCl and thereby inactivates this more powerful toxin. Our data show that addition of H2O2 in sublethal concentration decreases radiation-induced cell death to the level that is found in chloride-free solution, i.e. depending on pH, reduces it by a factor of > or = 3.

TI  - Spectral variations of laser-induced tissue emission during in vivo detection of malignancies in the female genital tract.  
AB  - A laser-based fluorescence-guided biopsy system has been developed for the screening and early detection of malignancies in the female inner/outer genital tract. Fluorescence spectra were recorded during in vivo exposure of normal and malignant tissue to He-Cd laser (442 nm) radiation. Spectral distribution of tissue natural fluorescence allowed for the development of simple algorithms, based on spectral intensity variations. A subsequent index of discrimination between normal and various malignant tissues has been calculated. This study focuses on the variability of the experimental data and the possible sources of spectral variations. These results suggest that monitoring of this index during colposcopy could enhance selective detection of the malignant tissue, reducing the risk of leaving pathologic tissue untreated during standard exploratory surgical procedures.

TI  - The radiosensitive cell line 180BR is not defective in the major DNA damage-sensing proteins.  
AB  - The fibroblast culture 180BR, established from a patient showing an adverse response to radiotherapy, has been shown previously to be hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and to be defective in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We demonstrate here that the products of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and its regulatory subunits (Ku 70 and Ku 80) are present at normal levels and possess functional activity. The product of the gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia was also detected in these cells. Apoptosis was detected after high-dose ionizing radiation exposure, and this process was accompanied by specific degradation of DNA-PKcs, ATM, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Activation of CPP32, an interleukin 1beta converting enzyme-like protease implicated in apoptosis, was also observed in 180BR cells in response to radiation damage. The radiosensitivity observed in 180BR cells can be accounted for, at least in part, by radiation-induced apoptosis, and the defect in these cells is not a gross one in DNA-PKcs or ATM.

TI  - Cryosurgical palliation of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors resistant to conventional therapy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatic cryosurgery is a well-recognized modality for hepatic colon metastases. We examined its potential use for refractory neuroendocrine tumors causing progressive symptoms. METHODS: Between July 1992 and February 1997, 19 patients (with islet cell, 7; carcinoid, 8; vasoactive intestinal peptide, 1; gastrinoma, 3) underwent cryosurgery with ultrasonography. The number of lesions frozen ranged from 1 to 16 (median, 8), and their diameters ranged from 2 to 15 cm with an average of 4 cm. Patients underwent resection of the primary tumor either before (37%) or concurrent with (32%) cryosurgery, and half underwent excision of metastases with cryosurgery. Before cryosurgery, patients received chemotherapy (63%), somatostatin (47%), interferon (10%), hepatic artery ligation (5%), radiation (10%), and/or omeprazole (16%). RESULTS: The reduction in tumor markers reached 90% (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), 80% (vasoactive intestinal peptide), 90% (gastrin), 90% (pancreatic polypeptide), and 80% (serotonin). At a median follow-up of 17 months, the metastases had progressed in 11 patients (two underwent a second cryosurgical procedure that eliminated symptoms) and five had died. Subsequently an additional five patients received chemotherapy and three somatostatin. Median symptom-free and overall survival were 10 months and more than 49 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cryosurgery dramatically relieved symptoms with significant reduction in tumor markers. The reduced tumor burden may explain the subsequent response to systemic therapy. Cryosurgery is a useful adjuvant in symptomatic patients with refractory hepatic neuroendocrine metastases.

TI  - Contribution to the pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to large arteries.  
AB  - We report a case of a 35-year-old man who died of a brain infarct 20 months after radiotherapy for carcinoma of the tonsil with metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. Histology revealed mild atherosclerosis, necrotizing vasculitis, and occlusive thrombosis of the internal carotid artery. Significant changes were observed in the vasa vasorum: swelling and detachment of the endothelium, subendothelial oedema, hyaline change, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls with mononuclear cellular infiltration, accompanied by focal haemorrhages and chronic inflammation in the periadventitial soft tissue. We believe that these changes of the vasa vasorum and necrotizing vasculitis are causally related and that vasculitis represents focal ischaemic necroses with inflammatory reaction. Our findings support the hypothesis, based on experimental studies, that injury to the vasa vasorum is an important mechanism in the development of radiation-induced vasculopathy of large arteries. They also suggest an evolution of the injury to the vasa vasorum and periadventitial tissue from the early lesions described in our patient, to late stages resulting in dense periadventitial fibrosis as reported previously. We suggest that injury to the vasa vasorum and the consequent ischaemic lesions of the arterial wall are morphological features distinguishing radiation-induced arterial injury from spontaneous atherosclerosis.

TI  - A comparison of intracavitary versus interstitial irradiation in the treatment of cervical cancer.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Management of locally advanced cervical cancer consists primarily of combination external and internal radiation. In order to investigate the impact of intracavitary brachytherapy versus interstitial brachytherapy on local tumor control, survival, and complications, we retrospectively reviewed the concomitant experience of two institutions, each of which practice exclusively one of these radiotherapeutic techniques. METHODS: Between 1979 and 1989, 61 patients with bulky stage II, III, or IVA cervical cancer were treated using a combination of teletherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy at one institution, while 70 similar patients were treated with teletherapy and interstitial brachytherapy at another institution. Patients in both groups were similar with respect to age, FIGO stage, tumor size, surgical stage, and histologic subtype. Patients treated with intracavitary therapy received a mean cumulative dose of 7706 cGy to point A and 5523 cGy to point B using standard Fletcher-Suit techniques. Those who received interstitial irradiation were treated with a mean external dose of 5050 cGy and 2 interstitial implants using a transperineal Syed-Neblett template with a mean tumor dose of 2239 and 1,942 cGy with each application, respectively. Patients treated with chemoradiation were excluded from this review. RESULTS: Although initial rates of local control were not different, prolonged 5-year disease-free survival (50% vs 21%, P = 0.01) and improved 5-year local control (61% vs 32%, P = 0.01) were observed among patients with stage II disease treated with intracavitary irradiation. No statistical differences in survival could be detected among stage III and IVA patients. Women treated with intracavitary irradiation received a larger dose of brachytherapy than those treated with interstitial therapy (4608 vs 3504 radium milligram hours equivalent, P < 0.0001) because a tandem was only used in 17 (24%) interstitial implants. Major complications occurred in 21% of patients in each group. CONCLUSION: When a tandem is infrequently used during interstitial brachytherapy, the toxicity is similar to that of intracavitary techniques. However, more relapses are observed among patients with stage II lesions treated with interstitial irradiation.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of indium-111-labeled chimeric anti-CEA monoclonal antibody.  
AB  - Chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) is a high-affinity (1.16 x 10[11] M[-1]) IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). This pilot trial evaluated the tumor-targeting properties, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of 111In-labeled cT84.66. METHODS: Patients with CEA-producing metastatic malignancies were administered a single intravenous dose of 5 mCi 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-cT84.66. Serial blood samples, 24-hr urine collections and nuclear images were collected up to 7 days postinfusion. Human antichimeric antibody response was assessed up to 6 mo postinfusion. RESULTS: Imaging of at least one known tumor site was observed in 14 of 15 (93%) patients. Seventy-four lesions were analyzed with an imaging sensitivity rate of 45.1% and a positive predictive value of 94.1%. In one patient, two additional bone metastases developed within 6 mo of antibody administration at sites initially felt to be falsely positive on scan. One patient developed a human antichimeric antibody response predominantly to the murine portion of the antibody. The antibody cleared serum with a median T(1/2alpha) of 6.53 hr and a T(1/2beta) of 90.87 hr. Interpatient variations in serum clearance rates were observed and were secondary to differences in clearance and metabolic rates of antibody-antigen complexes by the liver. One patient demonstrated very rapid clearance of antibody by the liver, which compromised antibody localization to the primary tumor. Antibody uptake in primary and metastatic tumors ranged from 0.5% to 10.5% injected dose/kg, resulting in estimated radiation doses ranging from 0.97 to 21.3 cGy/mCi 90Y. Antibody uptake in regional lymph nodes ranged from 1.3% to 377% injected dose/kg, resulting in estimated radiation doses ranging from 2.0 to 617 cGy/mCi 90Y. CONCLUSION: Chimeric T84.66 demonstrated tumor targeting that was comparable to that of other radiolabeled intact anti-CEA Mabs. Its immunogenicity after single administration was lower than murine Mabs. These properties make cT84.66 or a lower molecular weight derivative attractive for further evaluation as an imaging agent. These same properties also make it appropriate for future evaluation in Phase I therapy trials. Finally, a wide variation in the rate of antibody clearance was observed, with one patient demonstrating very slow clearance, resulting in the highest estimated marrow dose of the group, and one patient demonstrating unusually rapid clearance, resulting in poor antibody localization to tumor. Data from this study suggest that serum CEA levels, antibody-antigen complex clearance and, therefore, antibody clearance are influenced by both the production and clearance rates of CEA. This underscores the need to further identify, characterize and understand those factors that influence the biodistribution and clearance of radiolabeled anti-CEA antibodies to allow for better selection of patients for therapy and rational planning of radioimmunotherapy.

TI  - Androgenesis and homozygous gynogenesis in muskellunge (Esox masquinongy): evaluation using flow cytometry.  
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on denucleation of eggs and investigate the heat-shock conditions for diploidization for induction of androgenesis in muskellunge, Esox masquinongy. Several egg incubation media, including saline, Ringer's solution, and Ringer's solution supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA), were found suitable to maintain the egg fertility as high as in muskellunge ovarian fluid. The optimal doses of UV radiation were 660-1320 J/m2, at which 100% haploid larvae were produced at a hatching rate of 22.5 +/- 2.8%. UV irradiation at low doses (165-330 J/m2) generated abnormal larvae, which were morphologically identical to haploids. Using a flow cytometry method, it was found that cellular DNA content of these larvae was close to that of diploids but significantly lower in value and had a wider distribution (expressed as coefficient of variation) than that of control fish. This suggested that a low dose of UV irradiation might cause gene mutations, alteration of chromosomal conformation and fragmentation, but did not prevent maternal DNA from participating in mitotic division. Interference of maternal DNA residues could be another reason for the poor viability of androgenetic fish. A high dose of UV radiation (1980 J/m2) caused development of severely deformed embryos, indicating that UV radiation also damaged molecules in the eggs other than the denucleation. Our results suggest that classic color and allozyme markers might not be sufficient to prove a complete androgenesis. In order to optimize time and duration of shock for induced diploidization, we investigated the heat-shock conditions for inhibiting the first mitotic cleavage through induction of homozygous gynogenesis. We found that heat-shock treatment at 31 degrees C for 9 min starting at 1.4 tau 0 (a dimensionless factor describing progress in embryo development) after fertilization produced the highest percentage of diploids at hatching.

TI  - Slow release cisplatin combined with radiation for the treatment of canine nasal tumors.  
AB  - Thirteen dogs with malignant tumors of the nasal cavity were treated with a combination of slow release cisplatin and megavoltage radiation. Radiation was delivered on a Monday through Friday schedule using a 6 MV linear accelerator. The median total dose was 49.5 Gy (range 49.5-56 Gy). Cisplatin was given using an open-cell polylactic acid polymer, impregnated with the drug and implanted intramuscularly at a distant site, as a slow release delivery system (OPLA-Pt [THM Biomedical, Inc]). The median dose used was 60 mg/m2 (range 60-100 mg/m2). When combined with radiation, this delivery system caused no systemic drug toxicity, and a local tissue reaction was seen in only two dogs. Acute side effects to normal tissue from radiation were not enhanced, as measured by subjective assessment. When compared to a group of historical controls that received radiation without OPLA-Pt, the dogs that received combined radiation and cisplatin had longer overall survival times, with a median of 580 days. The control group had a median survival of 325 days. Previously reported median survival times for comparable megavoltage radiation treatment range from 6 to 13 months. Some dogs in both groups also received adjubant chemotherapy but this did not influence survival time. By multivariate analysis, only the use of OPLA-Pt was found to significantly influence survival, with a p value of p = 0.023. Mega-voltage radiation and slow release cisplatin appears to be a well tolerated combination that may favorably affect survival of dogs with nasal tumors.

TI  - P53 expression in altered limbal basal cells of pingueculae, pterygia, and limbal tumors.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We previously discovered that the pathogenesis of pterygia was due to a vimentin-expressing, altered limbal epithelial basal cell, the pterygium cell. Since UV radiation epidemiologically correlates as the etiologic agent for pterygia and limbal tumors and is mutagenic for the p53 gene, our goal was to search for p53 gene mutations immunohistochemically in the altered limbal basal cells of these growths and of pingueculae from which they seem to originate. METHODS: Longitudinal serial sections through six pingueculae, 14 primary and five recurrent pterygia, and five limbal tumors were studied immunohistochemically with p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 and, in some specimens, with antivimentin antibody. RESULTS: P53 expression was found in the limbal cells of all pterygia, limbal tumors, and Stage II pingueculae, but not in normal limbal-corneal epithelial cells. However, when the same specimens were examined with a TUNEL assay, few if any apoptotic cells were found. A finding of increased nuclear p53 gene product with little or no apoptosis is consistent with an activating mutation of the p53 gene, resulting in increased steady-state levels of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased nuclear p53 in the limbal epithelium of pterygia, limbal tumors, and most pingueculae indicates the probable existence of p53 mutations in these cells as an early event in their development, which is consistent with their causation by UV radiation causation. In addition, due to a damaged p53-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, mutations in other genes are progressively acquired which allows the multi-step development of pterygia and limbal tumor cells from p53 positive cells overlying a Stage II pinguecula. Similarly, a pterygium dysplasia could arise from a pterygium cell. A classification for limbal basal cell tumors is proposed, and the different stromal changes in pingueculae, pterygia, and limbal tumors are identified. Two cell types were also identified: a p53-positive pinguecula limbal epithelial cell (a pinguecula II cell) and a p53-positive pterygium dysplasia cell (pterygium dysplasia cell).

TI  - Chromosome healing, telomere capture and mechanisms of radiation-induced chromosome breakage.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed that radiation-induced chromosome breaks are the result of a cell's inability to rejoin DNA double-strand breaks (dsb), but the exact mechanisms underlying the failure to rejoin some dsb and the conversion of these lesions into chromosome breaks are poorly understood at present. It has been speculated that the conversion of dsb into chromosome breaks, following exposure of mammalian cells to ionizing radiation, may be mediated by the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that has two distinct functions, to replicate pre-existing chromosome ends (telomeres) and to heal broken chromosomes by de novo addition of telomeric sequences directly on to non-telomeric DNA. Alternatively, dsb may be converted into chromosome breaks by a telomerase-independent mechanism termed telomere capture. PURPOSE: To review telomere biology and to examine the significance of chromosome healing and telomere capture mechanisms tor radiation cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: The currently available literature suggests that telomere capture may be a more frequent mechanism for stabilization of broken chromosomes in mammalian cells than telomerase-mediated chromosome healing. However, a definitive conclusion must await improvements in the resolution of molecular cytogenetic techniques to a degree which allows telomerase products to be clearly distinguishable from subtelomeric cryptic translocations indicative of telomere capture.

TI  - UVB-induced association of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1/TNF receptor-associated factor-2 mediates activation of Rel proteins.  
AB  - Exposure of mammalian skin to UV light results in induced gene transcription, playing a role in inflammation, immunosuppression, and tumor promotion. One important group of transcription factors induced by UV radiation is composed of members of the Rel/NF-kappa B family, which are known to play a major role in the transcriptional activation of many genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and viral proteins. However, the upstream events in the transduction of the UVB signal to Rel protein activity are, as yet, unknown. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that exposure of keratinocytes to UVB causes rapid association of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 with its downstream partner TRAF-2. The functional relevance of this association is demonstrated by experiments showing that expression of a dominant negative TNF receptor 1 or TRAF-2 protein inhibits UVB-induced Rel-dependent transcription. Inclusion of a neutralizing antibody toward TNF alpha has no effect on UVB activation of a Rel-responsive reporter gene. Therefore, UVB-induced activation of Rel proteins via TNF receptor 1, independent of ligand activation, is a key component in the UV response in keratinocytes.

TI  - Combined-modality therapy for head and neck cancer.  
AB  - Chemotherapy, when combined with radiotherapy and/or surgery in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer, appears to be most efficacious if it is given concurrently with radiotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been shown to improve locoregional control and/or disease-free or overall survival in some randomized trials. However, acute mucositis is usually increased with simultaneous drug and radiation administration, especially when more than one drug is given concurrently with radiotherapy. The optimal drug or drug combinations for use in combined-modality therapy and the optimal drug and radiation dose schedules remain to be determined. Alternating radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy may also be beneficial and needs further evaluation. Induction chemotherapy followed by definitive radiotherapy in the chemotherapy responders is an alternative treatment option for patients with locally advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx who desire organ function preservation. Induction and/or adjuvant chemotherapy may also decrease or delay the appearance of distant metastasis. However, induction chemotherapy has not been shown to improve locoregional control or overall survival. Further clinical trials using novel drugs, innovative radiation and drug dose schedules, and other treatment modifiers are needed to improve the therapeutic ratio.

TI  - Murine susceptibility to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is influenced by a genetic factor implicated in susceptibility to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.  
AB  - From evidence of interpatient variability in normal tissue sensitivity to radiotherapy and from radiation studies using inbred mouse strains, it is hypothesized that individual variation in susceptibility to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is genetically controlled. A genetic model has been developed from the fibrosis-prone C57BL/6J and the fibrosis-resistant C3Hf/Kam mouse strains. Inheritance of the fibrotic phenotype was characterized in F1 and F2 (F1 intercross) generations derived from the parental strains. Genetic mapping was used to determine whether the quantitative trait loci (QTL), which influence susceptibility to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in these progenitor strains, could be implicated in susceptibility to radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Mice were treated with 14 or 16 Gy (60Co) to the whole thorax. The doses were selected to investigate the response at the LD50 and LD100 of C3Hf/Kam mice. The animals were sacrificed 33 weeks after treatment or when moribund. The percentage of lung with fibrosis for each mouse was quantified with image analysis of a histological section of the lung. For both the 14- and 16-Gy data sets, heritability was estimated at 38 +/- 11%, and the number of genetic factors influencing susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis was estimated to be one or two. Two hundred fifty-five F2 intercross mice were genotyped with markers at the bleomycin loci on chromosomes 11 and 17 (chromosome 17 marker is at the major histocompatibility complex). Genetic linkage was established for the marker on chromosome 17 (P = 3.0 x 10(-6)), which accounts for 6.6% of the F2 phenotypic variance but not for the markers surrounding the QTL on chromosome 11 (P = 0.37). The inheritance data suggested that susceptibility to radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis is a heritable trait controlled by two genetic loci, and through genomic mapping, a QTL on chromosome 17 was identified as one of the loci.

TI  - The benefit and risk of postmastectomy radiation therapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer.  
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) for prophylaxis against locoregional recurrence in high-risk breast cancer patients, and the rate of complication associated with such treatment, we retrospectively reviewed 79 breast cancers in 78 patients, who were given therapy (PMRT) between April 1990 and March 1995. Radiation doses were 46-50 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. High-risk factors included primary tumor (> or = 5 cm) in 19 (24.1%) patients, positive axillary lymph nodes (> or = 4) in 56 (70.9%) patients, positive or close (< or = 2 mm) surgical margins in 14 (17.7%) patients, and central or inner quadrant tumor with positive axillary nodes and lymphovascular invasion in seven (8.9%) patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy was also given to 69 of 78 (88.5%), patients and hormonal therapy to 41 of 78 (53.7%) patients. The median follow-up time was 25 months (range, 7-66 months) after mastectomy. Our study revealed that locoregional failure as the first site of failure occurred in only one of 78 (1.3%) patients. Relapse-free survival at 3 years was 67.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 52.0-81.3], and overall survival was 76.9% (95% CI, 63.3-90.6). The incidence of radiological evidence of lung fibrosis increased significantly in patients whose internal mammary chain was included in the radiation field. The occurrence of lung fibrosis can be reduced by changing radiation treatment technique and keeping central lung distance (CLD) of tangential field to < or = 2.8 cm in tangential field technique or < or = 1.4 cm in tangential with a separate internal mammary field technique. We concluded that the risk of locoregional recurrence in high-risk breast cancer patients can be much reduced by PMRT. With careful selection of radiation treatment fields, radiotherapy technique, and limitation of CLD to < or = 2.8 cm in tangential technique or < or = 1.4 cm in separate technique, the risk of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis is minimal. PMRT should be recommended for breast cancer patients who are at high risk for locoregional recurrence.

TI  - [Radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas in children: high prevalence of RET rearrangement]  
AB  - Papillary thyroid carcinomas were observed in children living in the Gomel region of Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl reactor accident in April 1986. Radioactive fallout, iodine-131 in particular, led to thyroid doses of > 10 Gy in some cases. Till now, more than 400 thyroid carcinomas developed. They provide a unique possibility to search for characteristic molecular aberrations. Small fresh frozen thyroid tumor samples from 59 children were available. cDNA after reverse transcription of mRNA was amplified by multiplex PCR and analyzed for the presence of RET rearrangement (PTC1, 2 or 3) by identification-PCR with specific primers and by direct sequencing. A significantly higher prevalence of RET rearrangement was found in the thyroid carcinomas of radiation-exposed children than formerly described for adult thyroid carcinomas. While the prevailing type of RET rearrangement in adult thyroid carcinomas is PTC1 involving RET and the H4 gene, the majority of tumors in radiation-exposed children shows PTC3. In this type of rearrangement the 3'-tyrosin kinase domain of RET becomes dependent on the 5'-regulatory part of the ELE gene. Different breakpoints were found in the ELE gene. Besides ELE/RET transcripts, reciprocal RET/ELE transcripts were expressed indicating a complete inversion of the two genes after double stand break and their functional activity in both rearranged forms. Paracentric inversion on chromosome 10 bringing the functional tyrosine kinase domain of c-RET under the regulatory control of the ubiquitously expressed ELE gene appears to be a typical molecular lesion in thyroid carcinomas of children after radiation. This rearrangement is thought to endow juvenile thyrocytes with a clonal growth advantage and may be a critical initiating event of thyroid carcinogenesis in radiation-exposed children.

TI  - Rhodobacter capsulatus genes encoding form I ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (cbbLS) and neighbouring genes were acquired by a horizontal gene transfer.  
AB  - Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the form I ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) genes (cbbL and cbbS) of the non-sulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus indicated that the deduced amino acid sequence of the large subunit was not closely homologous to the large subunit from related organisms. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the large subunit protein (CbbL) more closely resembled the enzyme from alpha/beta/gamma purple bacteria and cyanobacteria and is within a 'green-like' radiation of the RubisCO phylogenetic tree, well separated from CbbL of the related organism Rhodobacter sphaeroides. A cbbQ gene was discovered downstream of cbbS in Rh. capsulatus, a gene arrangement which also appears to be limited to certain organisms containing a 'green-like' RubisCO. Upstream, and divergently transcribed from cbbLSQ, is a gene (cbbRI) that encodes a LysR-type transcriptional activator. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of CbbRI also suggests that this protein is quite distinct from the Rh. sphaeroides CbbR protein, and is even distinct from the previously described CbbRII protein, the gene of which is upstream and divergently transcribed from the cbbII operon of Rh. capsulatus. Interestingly, Rh. capsulatus CbbRI is more closely related to CbbR from bacteria whose RubisCO falls within the 'green-like' radiation of the CbbL tree. These studies suggest that the cbbRI-cbbL-cbbS-cbbQ genes were acquired by Rh. capsulatus via horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial species containing a 'green-like' RubisCO.

TI  - Stereotactic radiosurgery: comparing different technologies [see comments]  
AB  - Radiosurgery can be defined as 3-dimensional stereotactic irradiation of small intracranial targets by various radiation techniques. The goal is to deliver, with great accuracy, a large, single fraction dose to a small intracranial target, while minimizing the absorbed dose in the surrounding tissue. This article describes certain technical aspects of radiosurgery and compares the different methods of performing such treatment. The 2 most frequently used types of devices for radiosurgery are units with multiple cobalt sources (e.g., the Gamma Knife) and those based on a linear accelerator. In the former, highly collimated beams of radiation from the cobalt sources intersect at the target. In the latter, the source of a highly collimated beam of high-energy photons directed at the target turns through an arc or set of arcs. The accuracy of target localization, the steepness of fall-off of the radiation dose outside the target and the ability to irradiate an irregularly shaped target are all comparable for these 2 types of devices, despite claims to the contrary.

TI  - Treatment of metastatic bone pain with tin-117m Stannic diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid: a phase I/II clinical study.  
AB  - The physical characteristics of Sn-117m combined with the biodistribution of the compound tin-117m (Stannic, 4+) diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sn-117m DTPA) suggest that it should be an excellent agent for the palliation of pain from bony metastases. Prior work has established the dosimetry and the safety for the material in human beings. The presence of low-energy conversion electrons should result in the relative sparing of the bone marrow while delivering a high radiation dose to sites of bony metastatic disease. Forty-seven patients with painful bone metastases from various malignancies were treated with Sn-117m DTPA. The patients were assigned to five different dose levels ranging from 2.64 to 10.58 MBq (71-286 microCi) per kg of body weight. Follow-up included review of pain diaries, performance scores, analgesic requirements, blood chemistries, and hematological assessment. Three patients received a second treatment. There was an overall response rate for relief of pain of 75% (range, 60-83%) in the 40 treatments that could be evaluated. No correlation was apparent in this limited series between response rate and the five dose levels used. The relief was complete in 12 patients (30%). The time to onset of pain relief was 19 +/- 15 days with doses < or = 5.29 MBq/kg and 5 +/- 3 days with doses > or = 6.61 MBq/kg. Myelotoxicity was minimal, with only one patient having a marginal grade 3 WBC toxicity. On the basis of our data, Sn-117m DTPA should be an effective and safe radiopharmaceutical for palliation of painful bony metastases. A large-scale trial is warranted to evaluate it in comparison to other similar agents.

TI  - A-bomb data: detection of bias in the Life Span Study cohort.  
AB  - By drawing a distinction between A-bomb survivors with and without bomb-related injuries, it was possible to see that instead of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort being a normal, homogenous population, there were significant differences between survivors with and without multiple injuries, and that these differences occurred largely among survivors who were under 10 or over 50 years of age when exposed. There also was a concentration of A-bomb-related injuries among survivors who eventually developed leukemia. So it is possible that deaths before 1950 had left the LSS cohort permanently biased in favor of persons who had high levels of resistance to all (early and late) effects of radiation. It is also possible that the high proportion of leukemia cases among the deaths of A-bomb survivors from 1950 to 1970 were because the radiation caused an initial leukocytosis followed by loss of immunologic competence.

TI  - Radiation policy: a decision-making model.  
AB  - Priority setting in radiation policy is complex because it depends to a large extent on risk perception. It has been shown repeatedly that the public is much more sensitive to potential harmful sequelae of radiation than to those of other environmental pollutants. Thus, cancer risk, particularly at low doses, has become a sociopolitical issue. The principle that radiation causes cancer, is life shortening, and causes an array of other pathologic disorders, is well accepted yet the quantification of sequelae at the lower end point of the dose-response curve is still controversial. The presence of a significant carcinogenic effect at very low doses has strong financial implications. Sociopolitical and economic values play a major role in the interpretation of available data. Thus, the use of nuclear energy is a function of risk/benefit, pressures, available alternatives, and cost. Three case studies--nuclear plant workers, children irradiated for an essentially benign condition, and food safety--are used to illustrate polar policy decisions.

TI  - Local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy for invasive breast cancer: high incidence in young patients and association with poor survival.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To study risk factors for local recurrence (LR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for invasive breast cancer and, for patients with an LR, the mode of detection, location, treatment, influence of radiation therapy, and impact on survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 1360 patients (median age 52 years; range 24-88) with a total of 1393 pT1-2 N0-1 tumors treated with BCT between 1980-1994 were studied (median follow-up 52 months). The adequacy of radiation treatment of the patients developing LR was studied in a quality control study. The impact of LR on overall survival and distant metastasis was studied in a Cox regression model with LR as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: A total of 88 LR occurred with a 5- and 10-year LR risk of 8 and 12%. Age was the only significant risk factor. Compared to patients > 65 years old, patients < 45 years old and patients 45-65 years old had a relative risk (RR) of 4.09 and 2.41, respectively, of developing LR. Risk on LR was found to increase gradually with younger age. Radiation therapy was considered adequate and did not play a role in influencing the LR rate. Almost 65% of the LR were true or marginal recurrences. Of all LR, 80% appeared during the first 5 years and were detected with equal frequency by the patient herself, the physician, and annual mammography. LR was a major predictor for distant metastasis (RR: 4.90; 3.15-7.62) and death (RR: 4.29; 2.93-6.28). CONCLUSION: Young age is a major risk factor for LR and there is a significant gradual increase in LR with decreasing age. LR is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis and death. Whether LR is the cause of or a marker for distant metastasis remains unresolved.

AB  - In order to reduce radiation dose in the application of CT for lung-cancer screening, we investigated the potential of low-dose screening helical CT (SHCT) by reducing the tube current and using an additional 10 mm aluminum filter. Six healthy volunteers were scanned at various tube currents (50 mA, 30 mA, 20 mA) with and without the filter. In comparison with the images at 50 mA without the filter, we evaluated the visualization of normal anatomical structures and the detection of simulated nodules at low-dose SHCT. Although a bias toward unclearness in the visualization of small anatomical structures was noted at 20 mA with use of the filter, no structure was assessed as having no visualization at any low-dose scan. Detection of simulated nodules was not degraded significantly by reducing the tube current to 20 mA and using the filter. Further reduction of radiation dose at SHCT may be achieved by the application of small tube current and an additional filter.

TI  - Effect of pentoxifylline on radiation-induced G2-phase delay and radiosensitivity of human colon and cervical cancer cells.  
AB  - Cells of three adherent cell lines with mutated p53 (WiDr and C33-A) and disrupted p53 (C4-I) were used to investigate the effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on radiation-induced G2-phase block and its relationship to radiosensitivity. Postirradiation exposure to 0.25-1.0 mM PTX resulted in an increase in radiosensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner as determined by a clonogenic assay. The change in radiation sensitivity was quantified by calculating the enhancement ratio (ER) at a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy; the ER for WiDr cells was 1.23+/-0.03 and 1.39+/-0.15 for 0.5 and 1.0 mM PTX, respectively. For C33-A cells, the ER ranged from 1.04+/-0.04 to 1.99+/-0.17 for 0.25-1.0 mM PTX, whereas for C4-I cells the values were 1.29+/-0.04 and 1.76+/-0.17 for 0.25 and 0.5 mM PTX. In asynchronous WiDr, C33-A and C4-I cells, flow cytometry analysis showed a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase which was detectable at 6 h and peaked at 12 h after irradiation. Such a G2/M-phase block was transient at a dose of 2 Gy and persisted at 48 or 72 h after a dose of 4 or 6 Gy. At 12 h after 2 Gy, PTX significantly reduced the radiation-induced G2/M-phase block in a dose-dependent manner. After the higher doses of 4 and 6 Gy, the dose-dependent G2-phase arrest was significantly alleviated at 24 h by treatment with PTX, and the kinetics of this alleviation depended on the radiation dose. The results demonstrate that human colon and cervical cancer cells characterized by a mutated or disrupted p53 (i.e. not transfected) are radiosensitized by PTX, which alleviates the postirradiation G2/M-phase block.

TI  - Variations in tumor levels of cis-platinum through a course of fractionated radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  
AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Radiation has been shown to affect the uptake of micromolecules by the tissues within the radiation fields. We measured tumor drug uptake throughout a course of radiotherapy for stage III non-operable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were treated with radiotherapy consisting of 15 fractions of 300 cGy given over 3 weeks. They were divided into groups of 2. At 1.5 hr before a given fraction of radiotherapy, one group was given i.v. a bolus of 6 mg/m2 CDDP (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum). Between 1.5 and 2 hr after radiotherapy, the patients underwent bronchoscopy, during which a biopsy was taken from the tumor mass. A similar procedure was carried out on a different group of 2 patients at each of the 15 radiotherapy fractions. The amount of platinum in the biopsy sample was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and expressed as ng platinum/mg tissue. In another 13 patients, a biopsy was taken before beginning the radiotherapy, and they served as controls. RESULTS: The quantity of platinum/g of tissue in the patients was 11 +/- 4.4 ng/mg tissue. During the course of fractionated radiotherapy, the quantity of platinum/g of tumor varied considerably between radiotherapy fractions. Maximum uptake was at fractions 8 and 9 (92 ng platinum/mg tissue) with the minima during the first few fractions and at fractions 10, 11 and 12 (an average 20 ng platinum/mg tissue). CONCLUSIONS: The cyclical variations in the uptake of CDDP by the tumor tissue during the protracted course of fractionated radiotherapy are probably due to the well-known effects of radiation on vascular function and capillary permeability. The results may have implications for future clinical protocols involving chemo- and radiotherapy for the treatment of the disease.

TI  - SPECT in the long-term evaluation of osteointegration in intraoral and extraoral implantology.  
AB  - Scintigraphic methods used in intraoral and extraoral implantology allow the evaluation of bone metabolism in the peri-implant zones, providing anatomic images and functional dynamics information on the osteointegration process. Twenty-five patients who underwent implantation operations for the application of intra- and extraoral prostheses were studied using technetium 99 m single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) procedures to evaluate osteointegration dynamics at 3 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The study demonstrates that radiation emission peaks 3 weeks after surgery with the maximal bone remodeling activity and 6 months after surgery after the functional loading of the implants only in intraoral fixtures. High uptake past the eighth month after surgery has never been detected and must be considered abnormal. SPECT offers the possibility of obtaining a three-dimensional reconstruction of the photon emission of selected structures. The use of these nuclear medicine methods in addition to traditional-type radiological procedures introduces new possibilities, although still in the clinical experimentation phase, for early diagnosis and inserted implant prognosis.

TI  - Prognosis of patients treated with whole-brain radiation therapy for metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease [see comments]  
AB  - We evaluated the effect of multiple treatment- and disease-related variables on the outcome of patients receiving whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Between November 1967 and December 1994, 21 patients were treated at our institution for GTD metastatic to the brain. All received WBRT, of median 2200 cGy (range 200-3600 cGy). Median follow-up, from date of diagnosis of brain metastases, was 77 months (range 11-170 months). The 5-year actuarial local control of initial brain metastases with > or = 2200 cGy was 91%, compared to 24% with < 2200 cGy (P = 0.05). The 2- and 5-year actuarial survivals of the 9 patients whose disease was controlled at extracranial sites were 100 and 83%, respectively, compared to 8 and 0%, respectively, for the 12 whose extracranial disease was not controlled (P = 0.0002). Four (33%) of the patients with persistent or progressive extracranial disease later developed new sites of brain metastases, compared to 0% of the patients whose extracranial disease was controlled (P = 0.05). Eleven patients progressed at their initial site(s) of brain metastasis or developed new intracranial lesions; 6 of them died of brain metastases. Survival of patients with GTD metastatic to the brain is excellent if extracranial disease can be controlled. The total dose of radiation is critical in achieving control of initial brain metastases. Patients with uncontrolled extracranial disease are more likely to develop new brain metastases. Salvage of intracranial failures after WBRT is rare.

TI  - Concurrent cisplatin, prolonged oral etoposide, and vincristine plus chest and brain irradiation for limited small cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG-9229).  
AB  - PURPOSE: The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prolonged oral (PO) etoposide as part of cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus concurrent chest/brain irradiation induction, followed by CAV consolidation, in the treatment of patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC-LD) within a cooperative group setting. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-six eligible patients with SCLC-LD received three 28-day cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v. (days 1, 8; 29, 36; and 57, 64), PO etoposide 50 mg/m2 (days 1-14, 29-42, and 57-70), and vincristine 2 mg i.v. (days 1, 29, and 57). Thoracic irradiation (TRT) was administered at 1.8 Gy in 25 daily fractions to a total dose of 45 Gy via an AP:PA arrangement, to begin concomitantly with induction chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was started on day 15 of induction therapy. Fifteen daily fractions of 2.0 Gy were administered to the entire brain to a total dose of 30 Gy to finish at approximately the same time as TRT. Two 21-day cycles of consolidation cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 i.v., doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 i.v., and vincristine 2 mg i.v. (all on days 1 and 22), were given beginning on day 106 or week 16, from the start of induction therapy. RESULTS: Among 56 eligible patients, 93% had SWOG performance status 0-1. All had adequate organ function and had not received prior therapy. The overall confirmed response rate was 46%, including 16% complete responders and 30% partial responders. After a minimum follow-up duration of 17 months, the Kaplan-Meier median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10 and 15 months, respectively. Two-year survival is 28%. Only 28 of 56 patients (50%) completed chemotherapy per protocol, while 52 of 56 patients (93%) completed radiation per protocol. Eleven patients (20%) discontinued secondary to toxicity and two patients died from treatment. The major toxicity was hematologic. The two deaths were secondary to infection. Of the nonhematologic toxicities, there were 10 cases of pulmonary fibrosis (including one Grade 3) and six cases of pneumonitis (including one Grade 3). CONCLUSION: Concomitant chemoradiation with oral etoposide as part of a platinum-based chemotherapy and TRT induction regimen is toxic. The CR rate is not better than our prior best group-wide experience. The progression-free and overall survival are similar to published trials utilizing short-course i.v. etoposide. As in chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC, there is no apparent advantage to prolonged exposure to etoposide, and toxicity resulted in an inferior therapeutic index compared to programs with shortened exposure.

TI  - Enhancement of radiation response by paclitaxel in mice according to different treatment schedules.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to determine if paclitaxel could be used as a radiosensitizer in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paclitaxel was tested as a single agent and combined with an X-ray treatment. Paclitaxel was administered i.p. in doses from 30 to 120 mg/kg b.w. to (C3D2F1) mice bearing spontaneous mammary carcinoma. Tumor growth delay (TGD) or tumor control dose (TCD50, radiation dose needed to induce local tumor control in 50% of irradiated animals) and moist desquamation dose (MDD50, radiation dose needed to induce serious moist desquamation in 50% of the non-tumor-bearing feet) were the endpoints. DNA flow cytometric analysis was performed. RESULTS: DNA analysis demonstrated a G2/M block of tumor cells and a depletion of cells in S phase, with a maximum at 24 h from paclitaxel administration. Administering paclitaxel, in graded doses, 15 min before a 10-Gy X-ray treatment resulted in a linear regression line, almost parallel to that with paclitaxel alone, with a growth delay of about 6 days. In contrast, varying the X-ray dose with a constant paclitaxel injection (45 mg/kg b.w.) treatment showed some degree of synergism as the linear regression curves diverged. Interval time and sequence between paclitaxel administration and a 10 Gy X-ray treatment did not influence TGD. Protocols with paclitaxel at 30, 45, or 60 mg/kg were combined with radiation treatments at various doses (from 10 to 65 Gy). Values of TCD50 varied from 50.8 Gy for X-ray alone to 31.8 Gy for paclitaxel 60 mg/kg + X-ray. No differences were observed among MDD of different protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, under some conditions, paclitaxel combined with radiation can show superadditive effects and this result combined with the lack of severe normal tissue damage indicate that a favorable therapeutic gain can be obtained.

TI  - Helical versus conventional CT in detecting meniscal injuries.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared volumetric helical and conventional CT in the study of meniscal injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with suspected meniscal tear underwent helical and conventional CT. Common parameters were 512 x 512 matrix, 14-15 cm FOV, 120 kV and 175 mA; helical CT was performed with 2 mm beam thickness, 1.5 mm/s table feed, 1 mm reconstruction index and conventional CT with 2 s scan time, 1 mm slice thickness and 1 mm table feed. All scans were photographed with a Laser printer using the same window (180/100). All patients also underwent sagittal and coronal T2* GE MRI at .5-T; slice thickness was 5 mm and interslice gap 1 mm. Nonparametric scales were used to study the menisci, as follows: for CT we had A = no visible injury; B = diffuse hypodensity (degenerative condition); C = questionable meniscal tear; D = unquestionable meniscal tear. For MRI, we had A = no visible injury; B = grade 1 or 2 injury; C = grade 3 injury; D = grade 4 injury. We used the 1-4 MR grading by Lotysch et al. and by Crues et al. MRI was used as the gold standard. The agreement between helical CT, conventional CT and MRI was calculated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: Helical and conventional CT found 23 and 15 patterns A, 6 and 10 B, 3 and 1 C and 1 and 7 D, respectively. MRI found 15 A, 8 B, 3 C and 7 D. There was no agreement between helical CT and MRI and between helical CT and conventional CT because of the meniscal tears underestimated by the former. Agreement was very high between conventional CT and MRI (p < .001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The main result of our experience is that helical CT appears less sensitive than conventional CT in detecting meniscal tears. The helical CT section profile (more roundish than that of conventional CT) and the lower radiation dose used by helical CT (with increased quantum noise) may have played a key role in its underestimation of meniscal tears.

TI  - Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and dose escalation: where do we stand?  
AB  - Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy is an effective means of delivering high doses of radiation with enhanced precision. Several institutions have gained substantial experience using this modality for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Reports from these centers have demonstrated not only excellent tolerance despite the administration of higher radiation doses, but improved biochemical and local control outcomes as well. Meticulous attention to treatment technique and dose volume histogram analysis are critical for the safe implementation of these higher doses. The emergence of intensity-modulated treatment planning has provided the opportunity at our institution to further escalate the radiation dose to 86.4 Gy while still respecting the surrounding normal tissue tolerance. Phase I studies will need to continue to define more clearly the maximal dose of radiation that can be delivered safely with this modality. Current studies indicate a direct correlation between dose and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival response for patients with intermediate and high-risk prognostic features. These patients likely represent the ideal cohort for future studies designed to investigate the impact of dose on biochemical and disease-free survival outcome. Copyright 1998 W.B. Saunders Company.

TI  - Protective effect of vanillin on radiation-induced micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations in V79 cells.  
AB  - Vanillin (VA), an anticlastogen, has been demonstrated to inhibit gene mutations in both bacterial and mammalian cells. However, the data on its effect against radiation-induced cytogenetic damage are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of VA on radiation-induced chromosomal damage in V79 cells. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to five doses of X-rays (1-12 Gy) and UV radiation (50-800 microJ x 10(2) cm-2 and posttreated with 3 concentrations of VA (5, 50 or 100 micrograms ml-1 for 16 h for micronucleus (MN) and 18 h for structural chromosomal aberration (SCA) analyses. MN and SCA assays were performed concurrently according to standard procedures. Results indicate that there was a dose related increase in the percent of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) (5.6 to 79.6) and percent of aberrant cells (Abs) (12 to 98) with X-ray treatment alone. Inhibition studies showed that the addition of VA at 100 micrograms ml-1 significantly reduced the percent of MNBN (21 to 48) induced by X-ray at 1, 2, and 4 Gy. There was a slight decrease in percent MNBN at 5 and 50 micrograms VA ml-1. All three concentrations of VA decreased percent Abs (15.7 to 57.1) induced by X-rays at all doses. UV radiation alone significantly increased percent MNBN (3.5 to 14.8) and percent Abs (17 to 29). Addition of 50 or 100 micrograms VA ml-1, significantly decreased percent MNBN (31.7 to 86.2) and percent Abs (54.5 to 90.9) at all doses of UV radiation. A decrease in percent MNBN (2.8 to 72.4) and percent Abs (34.8 to 66.7) was also noted at 5 micrograms VA ml-1. These data clearly indicate the protective effect of VA on radiation-induced chromosomal damage, suggesting that VA is an anticlastogenic agent.

TI  - Trends in the use of pelvimetry techniques [see comments]  
AB  - Assessment of maternal pelvic dimensions is usually considered necessary where vaginal delivery is contemplated in a breech presentation or if reduced pelvic dimensions are suspected in a current or previous pregnancy. Pelvimetry techniques include computed tomography (CT), conventional radiography, digital fluorography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The first three techniques result in a radiation dose to mother and fetus which, depending on how the technique is performed, can vary by up to 40-fold. Of the techniques using X-rays, CT pelvimetry with a lateral scanogram generally gives the lowest radiation dose and conventional radiography using an air gap technique with a single lateral view is a relatively low-dose alternative where CT is not available. A questionnaire was sent to 227 hospitals during 1993 and 1996 to assess whether there was a move towards lower dose techniques of pelvimetry. The results show a trend away from conventional pelvimetry (48.4% in 1993 to 28% in 1996) with a small proportion of centres using MRI (4%) in 1996. Of the centres still using conventional pelvimetry, relatively few were using a low-dose air-gap technique (2.1% in 1993 to 10.9% in 1996). An increasing majority of centres were using one-view CT (69.3% in 1993 and 80.4% in 1996) but a significant proportion were still performing more than one view. This study shows that there was a move towards lower dose techniques of pelvimetry but that there were still many hospitals that had not implemented a policy of reducing radiation exposure in these patients.

TI  - Close vaginal margins as a prognostic factor after radical hysterectomy [see comments]  
AB  - From 1965 to 1995, at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center, 1223 patients with stage IA2, IB, or IIA cervical cancer have undergone a radical hysterectomy. The charts of these patients were reviewed retrospectively for pathology reports showing positive or close surgical margins. Fifty-one of these cases had final pathology results interpreted as close vaginal margins (CVM), which we define as tumor less than or equal to 0.5 cm from the vaginal margins of resection. All slides of blocks with close vaginal margins were found and reviewed by a single pathologist. Twenty-eight (54.9%) had parametrial involvement or positive lymph nodes and received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Of the remaining 23 cases, only 6 had other high risk factors, tumor greater than 4 cm, poorly differentiated, greater than 50% invasion, or lymphovascular space involvement. Sixteen of 23 received radiation. The 5-year survival was significantly greater with RT, 81.3%, than without RT, 28.6% (P < 0.05). The recurrence rate was also decreased from 85.7 to 12.5% (P < 0.01). Although present in less than 2% of radical hysterectomy specimens, CVM without other high risk factors may be an important prognostic variable that should be considered when making adjuvant therapy decisions.

TI  - Predictors of delay in starting radiation treatment for patients with early stage breast cancer.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the factors predicting waiting time for radiation treatment in early breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1992 and December 1993, 739 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with conservative treatment at three McGill University Hospitals. Waiting time was defined as the interval between the date of surgery and the date of the first radiation treatment. Delay was defined as a waiting time of more than 7 weeks for women who did not receive chemotherapy (Group NC, n = 478), and as a waiting time of more than 24 weeks for those who received chemotherapy (Group C, n = 261). We analyzed predictive factors related to the patient (age, stage, treatment on protocol, income by postal code) and to the referring hospital (university or community hospital). RESULTS: For the entire population, 54% of patients were delayed, 72% in Group NC and 21.4% in Group C. Univariate analysis showed an impact of referring hospital in both groups, and of stage and treatment on protocol in Group C (all p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that delays were significantly less in Group NC for women referred from a community hospital (p = 0.001) and in Group C for women with Stage I disease (p = 0.06), those treated on protocol, and those referred from a university hospital (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: More than half of patients with early breast cancer waited more than the recommended intervals for radiation therapy. However, lower income breast cancer patients did not wait longer for treatment than higher income patients, possibly a result of the Canadian Medicare system which provides universal access to health care.

TI  - Overall survival of the medical oncologist: a new outcome measurement in cancer medicine.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changing patterns of patient referral, decreasing payments for service provision, confusing network participation and reimbursement, as well as challenges to autonomous clinical decision-making jeopardize the traditional role of the oncologist in delivering cancer care. The cancer patient also may be at risk with unproven cancer delivery systems that displace the oncologist as decision-maker and care provider. The authors have constructed a model that preserves the oncologist's clinical and financial autonomy while meeting marketplace demands for improved access, decreasing costs and preserved quality of care. METHODS: During a 4-year period, a group of private practice medical oncologists initiated a formal business plan to evaluate marketplace needs, then designed and implemented a novel cancer care delivery model. The model required reconfiguring the practice into an integrated Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations-certified cancer service corporation, providing medical, radiation, and gynecologic oncology. Palliative care, pain management, psychologic, and nutritional services were instituted as well as the vertical integration of home health and hospice care. Clinical pathways and treatment protocols were designed to enhance patient care and facilitate cost-of-care projections in designated populations using a cancer incidence forecasting model. Outcomes analysis are performed as part of ongoing continuous quality improvement, which continues to change this health care delivery system. RESULTS: In the 3 years since implementation of the model, the practice has increased from 16 to 24 physicians, and the number of offices has increased from 12 to 17. Patient encounters, both new and established, have doubled. Cost of services, specifically hospitalization, have been reduced by 50%. Clinical research referrals have increased 300%. Physician compensation has improved >20%. CONCLUSIONS: The model created a low cost, high value provider not burdened by allocated overhead. Decentralized care enhanced community access, which improved patient compliance, enhanced patient satisfaction, decreased hospitalization, and thereby decreased cost. The horizontal structure permited the flexibility for varied purchaser products and politically sensitive physician and hospital provider panels. Consensus-based protocol and pathway determination achieved maximum physician participation, which preserved clinical and financial autonomy, decreased variance, and facilitated clinical research.

TI  - Rejoining and misrejoining of radiation-induced chromatin breaks. IV. Charged particles.  
AB  - We have recently reported the kinetics of chromosome rejoining and exchange formation in human lymphocytes exposed to gamma rays using the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and premature chromosome condensation (PCC). In this paper, we have extended previous measurements to cells exposed to charged particles. Our goal was to determine differences in chromatin break rejoining and misrejoining after exposure to low- and high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. Cells were irradiated with hydrogen, neon, carbon or iron ions in the LET range 0.3-140 keV/microm and were incubated at 37 degrees C for various times after exposure. Little difference was observed in the yield of early prematurely condensed chromosome breaks for the different ions. The kinetics of break rejoining was exponential for all ions and had similar time constants, but the residual level of unrejoined breaks after prolonged incubation was higher for high-LET radiation. The kinetics of exchange formation was also similar for the different ions, but the yield of chromosome interchanges measured soon after exposure was higher for high-LET particles, suggesting that a higher fraction of DNA breaks are misrejoined quickly. On the other hand, the rate of formation of complete exchanges was slightly lower for densely ionizing radiation. The ratios between the yields of different types of aberrations observed at 10 h postirradiation in prematurely condensed chromosome preparations were dependent on LET. We found significant differences between the yields of aberrations measured in interphase (after repair) and metaphase for densely ionizing radiation. This difference might be caused by prolonged mitotic delay and/or interphase death. Overall, the results point out significant differences between low- and high-LET radiation for the formation of chromosome aberrations.

TI  - Direct evidence that apoptosis enhances tumor responses to fractionated radiotherapy.  
AB  - Currently, the contribution of cellular apoptotic sensitivity to tumor response after radiation therapy remains controversial. To address this issue, the survival of Rat-1 fibroblasts containing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-regulated c-Myc allele, c-MycER (T. D. Littlewood et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 23: 1686-1690, 1995), after single and fractionated doses of radiation was investigated. This model system allows pharmacological regulation of apoptosis sensitivity in the same cells in vitro and as xenograft tumors derived from these cells in vivo (G. I. Evan et al., Cell, 69: 119-128, 1992; R. M. Alarcon et al., Cancer Res., 56: 4315-4319, 1996). Activating c-MycER in vitro resulted in marked sensitization of Rat-1 fibroblasts to the effects of both single-dose and fractionated irradiation as measured by the induction of apoptosis and clonogenic survival. Overexpression of the antiapoptosis protein Bcl-2 suppressed the induction of apoptosis and increased clonogenic survival in cells with activated c-Myc after single-dose and fractionated radiation. Systemic time-release implant delivery of 4-hydroxytamoxifen to severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing Rat-1-MycER tumors over the course of either single-dose (10 Gy) or fractionated (five fractions of 2 Gy) radiotherapy resulted in prolonged tumor growth delay relative to identical tumors from mice that received placebo implants. Furthermore, tumors derived from Rat-1-MycER cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 exhibited shorter tumor growth delays relative to similarly treated Rat-1-MycER tumors. The length of tumor growth delay after single-dose or fractionated radiotherapy strongly correlated with the extent of radiation-induced apoptosis in the xenograft tumors as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling. These in vivo results provide direct evidence that increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to die by apoptosis increases the efficacy of fractionated radiotherapy by reducing tumor cell clonogenic survival.

TI  - Definitive radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy for Stage III carcinoma of the uterine cervix: retrospective analysis of prognostic factors concerning patient characteristics and treatment parameters.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess treatment outcome after definitive radiotherapy for Stage III cervical carcinoma retrospective analysis of the clinical data was performed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We enrolled 265 patients with Stage III cervical carcinoma who were treated with combined external beam radiotherapy [mean +/- standard deviation (SD), 50.3 +/- 1.8 Gy; range 40-70) and intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) (mean +/- SD, 19.8 +/- 2.4 Gy; range 10-32) using a high-dose-rate 60Co source. We retrospectively analyzed, as measures of the therapeutic outcome, the overall survival rate (OAS), relapse-free survival rate (RFS), locoregional event-free rate (LREF), distant metastasis (DM), and late complication. RESULTS: The 5-year OAS, RFS, and LREF rates (n = 265) were 50.7%, 57.1%, and 71.2%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed a significant favorable effect on the OAS rate for complete response (CR) (p = 0.024), maximum tumor diameter < 6 cm (SML) (p = 0.0009), Karnofsky performance score > or =70 (p = 0.046), age <75 years (p = 0.0043), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of > or =9 g/dl (p = 0.0005), and histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (p = 0.0089). In the multivariate analysis, Hb, SCC, SML, and CR remained significant prognostic factors. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, SML, Hb, age, and SCC showed significant effects on the RFS rate. Age > or =60 years (p = 0.017), Hb > or =9 g/dl (p = 0.0039), and SML (p = 0.0046) were significant favorable prognostic factors for the LREF rate identified by univariate analysis. In addition, advanced age, SML, and SCC showed significant beneficial effects on the LREF rate in the multivariate analysis. DM developed in 21.1% of patients, and the groups with Hb < 9 g/dl (p < 0.005), Karnofsky performance score of <70 (p < 0.001), and dose at point A in the ICBT < 16 Gy (p < 0.005) developed a significantly greater incidence of DM than did the groups without. The 5-year incidence was 2.6% for major bladder complication and 8.3% for major rectal complication. The radiation dose in the subgroup with rectal complication was significantly greater than that in the subgroup without complications. CONCLUSION: In patients with Stage III cervical carcinoma, tumor size, concentration of Hb, and histopathological diagnosis are strong prognostic factors for the therapeutic outcome. The ICBT dose in our study was small compared to the reported data, but the outcome was quite comparable. Thus, the dose we used might be the minimum required. However, locoregional control still remains an important problem. It is necessary to attain the optimal dose distribution in both the target volume and in critical organs. In high-risk patients, combined use of chemotherapy is crucial to improve the response to radiation.

The higher yield of bases destruction in DNA is explained by the transferring of a damage (unpaired electron) from 2-deoxyribosyl to a base within one nucleotide.

TI  - Map integration at human chromosome 10: molecular and cytogenetic analysis of a chromosome-specific somatic cell hybrid panel and genomic clones, based on a well-supported genetic map.  
AB  - Well-characterized, chromosome-specific somatic cell hybrid panels are powerful tools for the analysis of the human genome. We have characterized a panel of human x hamster somatic cell hybrids retaining fragments of human chromosome 10 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and associated them to genetic markers. Most of the hybrids were generated by the radiation-reduction method, starting from a chromosome 10-specific monochromosomal hybrid, whereas some were collected from hybrids retaining chromosome 10-specific fragments as a result of spontaneous in vitro rearrangements. PCR was used to score the retention of 57 microsatellite markers evenly distributed along a well-supported framework genetic map containing 149 loci uniquely placed at 69 anchor points (odds exceeding 1,000:1), with an average spacing of 2.8 cM. As an additional resource for genomic studies involving human chromosome 10, we report the cytogenetic localization of a series of YAC and PAC clones recognized by at least one genetic marker. Somatic cell hybrids provide a powerful source of partial chromosome paints useful for detailed clinical cytogenetic and primate chromosome evolution investigations. Furthermore, correlation of the above physical, genetic, and cytogenetic data contribute to an emerging consensus map of human chromosome 10.

TI  - Treatment of late recurrent vaginal malignancy after initial radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix: an analysis of 73 cases.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the reirradiation therapy in late recurrent vaginal malignancy after initial radiotherapy for carcinoma of the cervix. METHODS: From July 1972 to July 1992, 73 cases of late recurrent (over 5 years) vaginal malignancy after initial radiotherapy for cervical cancer were treated in our hospital. Both the original and recurrent cancers were biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma. All of these patients received reirradiation therapy; chemotherapy or operation was combined when necessary. The reirradiation was planned according to the site and volume of the recurrent tumor, previous radiation dose, and radiation side effects. Brachytherapy was mainly used. Before 1981, radium therapy was delivered at 30-40 Gy in 3-5 fractions to tumor base within 3-4 weeks. High-dose-rate (100 cGy/min) cobalt-60 afterloading therapy (Ralstron therapy) has been used instead of radium since 1981; the dose to the tumor base was 20-35 Gy/3-5 fractions/3-4 weeks. Then, vaginal mold was supplemented with a dose to a point 0.5 cm below the surface of the vaginal mucosa at 20-30 Gy/4-6 fractions/2-3 weeks. When the vulva or groin was involved, cobalt-60 or high-energy electron beam radiation was added with a dose at 30-40 Gy. Among these, 61 patients received irradiation therapy alone. Eleven patients received irradiation combined with chemotherapy. One patient received hysterectomy after reirradiation. RESULTS: The 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in this series were 54.7% (40/73), 46. 6% (28/60), and 40.3% (21/52), respectively. The 5-year survival rates for upper, upper-middle, and upper-lower vaginal tumor were 81. 8% (9/11), 33.3% (5/15), and 25.0% (3/12), respectively. The effect for upper vaginal recurrent malignancy was remarkably better than that for the upper-lower rate (P < 0.05). The local control rates for tumor >4 and <4 cm were 26.6% (4/15) and 86.5% (32/37), respectively (P < 0.01). The side effects of reirradiation in this series were serious: both moderate and severe radiation reactions were rectum 13.6% (10/73), hematuria 12.3% (9/73), vesicovaginal fistula 1.4% (1/73), and rectum-vaginal fistula 11.0% (8/73). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reirradiation for late recurrence in the vagina after previous radiotherapy for cervical cancer is valuable. Early detection and treatment could achieve better results. The smaller the recurrent tumor volume, the better the treatment effects. Reirradiation therapy should be carefully managed in order to reduce the complications as much as possible.

TI  - Treatment of early-stage breast cancer in the elderly: a health-outcome-based approach [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the post-lumpectomy treatment of a nonpalpable, stage I, T1b tumor, mammographically detected, in a 74-year-old woman without comorbidities. METHODS: A Markov process, through 120 monthly cycles, was used to model patient progression through a treatment program, employing literature data and a health-outcome utility. Treatments considered were: observation; radiation totaling 5,000 cGy over six weeks; tamoxifen, 20 mg/day, for five years; simple mastectomy; and radiation therapy plus tamoxifen. Health states included absence of disease (NED), loco-regional recurrence, distant metastasis, age-sex-race (ASR)-adjusted death, cancer mortality, treatment complications, and post-mastectomy death. Transition probabilities were established from the literature. Health-state utilities were determined from the responses of health care professionals to a basic reference gamble. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined to be 8.19 for radiation plus tamoxifen, decreasing to 8.04 for mastectomy, a difference of only a 0.15 years (1.8 months). Sensitivity analysis, however, showed relative stability in the ranking among treatment options. CONCLUSION: Although the model showed little difference between QALYs with the treatments, the combination of radiation and tamoxifen provides the optimal therapy for this case.

TI  - A close or positive margin after mastectomy is not an indication for chest wall irradiation except in women aged fifty or younger.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Indications for postmastectomy radiation include primary tumor size > or = 5 cm and/or > or = 4 positive axillary nodes. In clinical practice, patients with a close or positive margin after mastectomy are also often treated with postmastectomy radiation. However, there is little data regarding the risk of a chest wall recurrence in patients with close or positive margins who otherwise would be considered low risk (tumor size <5 cm and/or 0-3 positive nodes). To address this issue, we assessed the risk of a chest wall recurrence in women with Stage I-II breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and were found to have primary tumor size <5 cm and 0-3 positive nodes with a close or positive deep margin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The pathologic reports from 789 patients treated by mastectomy between 1985 and 1994 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 136 (17%) had tumor within 1 cm of the deep resection margin. The study population consists of 34 of these patients with close or positive margins whose primary tumor size was <5 cm with 0-3 positive axillary nodes and who received no postoperative radiation. The median age was 43 years (range 29-76). Of these, 44% had T1 tumors and 56% T2 tumors. Pathologic axillary nodal status was negative in 65% and positive in 35%. The median number of positive nodes was 1. The deep margin was positive in 2 patients, < or = 2 mm in 17 patients, 2.1-4 mm in 7 patients and 4.1-6 mm in 8 patients. Of the 34 patients, 67% received adjuvant chemotherapy +/- tamoxifen and 21% received tamoxifen alone. The median follow-up was 59 months (range 7-143). RESULTS: There were 5 chest wall recurrences at a median interval of 26 months (range 7-127). One was an isolated first failure, one occurred concurrent with an axillary recurrence, and three were associated with distant metastases. The 5- and 8-year cumulative incidences of a chest wall recurrence were 9% and 18%. Patient age correlated with the cumulative incidence of chest wall recurrence at 8 years; age < or = 50 years had a rate of 28% vs. 0% for age >50 (p = 0.04). There was no correlation with chest wall failure and number of positive nodes, ER status, lymphovascular invasion, location of primary, grade, family history, or type of tumor close to the margin. Of 5 chest wall failures, 4 were in patients who had received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy +/- tamoxifen. Chest wall failures occurred in 1 patient with a positive deep margin, 3 patients with margins within 2 mm, and 1 patient with a margin of 5 mm. The estimated cumulative incidence probability of chest wall recurrence at 8 years by margin proximity was 24% < or = 2 mm vs. 7% 2.1-6 mm (p = 0.36), and by clinical size 24% for T2 tumors vs. 7% for T1 (p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: A close or positive margin is uncommon (< or = 5%) after mastectomy in patients with tumor size <5 cm and 0-3 positive axillary nodes but, when present, it appears to be in a younger patient population. The subgroup of patients aged 50 or younger with clinical T1-T2 tumor size and 0-3 positive nodes who have a close (< or = 5 mm) or positive mastectomy margin are at high risk (28% at 8 years) for chest wall recurrence regardless of adjuvant systemic therapy and, therefore, should be considered for postmastectomy radiation.

TI  - Surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the rectum.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' aim was to determine survival and recurrence rates in patients undergoing resection of rectal cancer achieved by abdominoperineal resection (APR), coloanal anastomosis (CAA), and anterior resection (AR) without adjuvant therapy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The surgery of rectal cancer is controversial; so, too, is its adjuvant management. Questions such as preoperative versus postoperative radiation versus no radiation are key. An approach in which the entire mesorectum is excised has been proposed as yielding low recurrence rates. METHODS: Of 1423 patients with resected rectal cancers, 491 patients were excluded, leaving 932 with a primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum treated at Mayo. Eighty-six percent were resected for cure. Surgery plus adjuvant treatment was performed in 418, surgery alone in 514. These 514 patients are the subject of this review. Among the 514 patients who underwent surgery alone, APR was performed in 169, CAA in 19, AR in 272, and other procedures in 54. Eighty-seven percent of patients were operated on with curative intent. The mean follow-up was 5.6 years; follow-up was complete in 92%. APR and CAA were performed excising the envelope of rectal mesentery posteriorly and the supporting tissues laterally from the sacral promontory to the pelvic floor. AR was performed using an appropriately wide rectal mesentery resection technique if the tumor was high; if the tumor was in the middle or low rectum, all mesentery was resected. The mean distal margin achieved by AR was 3 +/- 2 cm. RESULTS: Mortality was 2% (12 of 514). Anastomotic leaks after AR occurred in 5% (16 of 291) and overall transient urinary retention in 15%. Eleven percent of patients had a wound infection (abdominal and perineal wound, 30-day, purulence, or cellulitis). The local recurrence and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 7% and 78%, respectively, after AR; 6% and 83%, respectively, after CAA; and 4% and 80%, respectively, after APR. Patients with stage III disease, had a 60% disease-free survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection of the envelope of supporting tissues about the rectum during APR, CAA, and AR when tumors were low in the rectum is associated with low mortality, low morbidity, low local recurrence, and good 5-year survival rates. Appropriate "tumor-specific" mesorectal excision during AR when the tumor is high in the rectum is likewise consistent with a low rate of local recurrence and good long-term survival. However, the overall failure rate of 40% in stage III disease (which is independent of surgical technique) means that surgical approaches alone are not sufficient to achieve better long-term survival rates.

The decrease in mean number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, CD5+, CD4+, CD8+ cells, content of serum alpha 1-thymosin and increased level of autoantibodies were detected in workers, whose dose rates irradiation were greater than 25 cSv. So, the quality differences in the changes of immune system, which were induced by low dose chronic irradiation were obtained.

TI  - Heme oxygenase induction by UVA radiation. A response to oxidative stress in rat liver.  
AB  - Heme oxygenase is a key enzyme for heme catabolism and catalyzes the oxidative degradation of heme to form biliverdin IX alpha, an immediate precursor of bilirubin. In order to shed light on the mechanism by which UVA radiation causes oxidative damage, the relationship between heme oxygenase induction and oxidative stress was studied. HO-1 activity, lipid peroxidation and generation of active oxygen species (H2O2) were measured in rat liver exposed to UVA radiation. Besides, soluble and enzymatic antioxidant defenses (GSH, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) were determined, while bilirubin antioxidant capacity was also evaluated. UVA radiation markedly increased both lipid peroxidation (180% +/- 7; S.E.M., n = 9 over control value of 0.1 +/- 0.01 nmol MDA/min per mg prot.) and steady state concentration of hydrogen peroxide (4 +/- 0.03 microM; S.E.M., n = 9) 3 h after treatment. At the same time, GSH content decreased to 3.6 +/- 0.2 mumol/g liver (S.E.M., n = 9) increasing thereafter. Antioxidant enzymes reached minimum values 6 h after UVA treatment (SOD: 7.2 +/- 0.2 U/mg protein, CAT: 7.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein, GSH-Px: 0.088 +/- 0.004 U/mg protein; S.E.M., n = 9), starting to increase 12 h after irradiation. HO-1 induction was observed 6 h after UVA irradiation, reaching a maximum value of 2.5 +/- 0.03 U/mg protein (S.E.M., n = 9) 12 h after treatment, and then declined until it reached control levels 24 h after exposure. Administration of bilirubin 2 h before UVA irradiation, entirely prevented HO-1 induction, the increase in MDA content and the decrease in GSH levels. This study shows that UVA irradiation leads to oxidative stress as evidenced by increased MDA content and H2O2 steady state levels, and depletion of GSH, SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. All these changes produced HO-1 induction. It is concluded that the induction of this enzyme could be a response to oxidative stress, since bilirubin can act as a physiological antioxidant.

TI  - Radiation inactivation of some food-borne pathogens in fish as influenced by fat levels.  
AB  - The influence of low (0.39-1.1%), medium (4.25%) and high (7.1-32.5%) fat levels in fish on radiation inactivation of four food-borne pathogens was investigated. Cells of Listeria monocytogenes 036, Yersinia enterocolitica F5692, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium at logarithmic phase were inoculated in 10% fish homogenates and subjected to gamma irradiation at ice temperature (0-1 degree C) with doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 kGy.  The radiation survival curves of L. monocytogenes and B. cereus were characterized by shoulders, while a tailing effect was depicted by cells of Y. enterocolitica and B. cereus. The D10 values in kGy calculated on the exponential part of the curve ranged from 0.2 to 0.3, 0.15 to 0.25, 0.1 to 0.15 and 0.09 to 0.1 for L. monocytogenes 036, B. cereus, Salm. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica F5692, respectively. This order (D10) of radiation resistance of each organism was not affected by the fat content of the fish. Inoculated pack studies carried out separately with each pathogen in fatty (Indian sardine, 7.1%) and lean (Golden anchovy, 0.39%) fish showed no difference in their survival after exposure to 1 kGy and 3 kGy doses, which corroborated the above observation. The practical significance of these results in the application of the technology is discussed.

TI  - Radiation nephropathy is treatable with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies showed that progression of established radiation nephropathy could be delayed by continuous treatment with high doses of captopril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The current studies were designed to determine whether a lower dose or a shorter treatment with captopril would be effective and whether an angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (AII blocker) would be effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the captopril studies, rats were given renal irradiation at doses sufficient to produce radiation nephropathy. Six months after irradiation, animals were stratified by azotemia and assigned to no treatment, continuous high- or low-dose captopril, or 6 weeks of high-dose captopril. Captopril was given in drinking water at 62.5 mg/l (low dose) or 500 mg/l (high dose). The AII blocker study had a similar design, except that the nephropathy was the result of total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation and the treatments were no treatment or continuous treatment with an AII blocker, L-158,809 (20 mg/l in drinking water). Animals were followed for 1 year with periodic studies of renal function. RESULTS: Survival and renal function were significantly enhanced by all treatments. Continuous captopril treatment was more effective than the 6-week course of treatment, but there was no difference in effectiveness between the high and low doses of captopril. In continuous therapy, captopril and the AII blocker had roughly equivalent efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Both the ACE inhibitor and the AII blocker were effective treatments for established radiation nephropathy. The best results with the ACE inhibitor required continuous therapy, but could be achieved with a low dose of the drug.

TI  - Mutation of the p53 gene in postradiation sarcoma.  
AB  - Radiotherapy is known to cause secondary malignancies in the radiation field; postradiation sarcomas (PRS) are one example of such malignancies. Little is known about the genetic changes, including p53 gene alterations, that are thought to play a role in the tumorigenesis of human PRS. In the present study, p53 gene mutations were analyzed on paraffin-embedded specimens from 24 patients with PRS (4 men and 20 women) by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. The primary tumors of these patients were uterine cervical cancers in 14, breast cancers in 3, malignant lymphomas in 2, and others in 5.  Total radiation doses ranged from 36 to 300 Gy (median, 60 Gy). The latent period between completion of radiation therapy and development of PRS ranged from 3 to 34 years (median, 10 years). Malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common PRS, accounting for 12 cases. PCR-SSCP revealed the aberrant mobility shifts of bands in 24 cases: 21 shifts in exon 5, 18 in exon 7, and 12 in exon 8. Direct sequencing of the SSCP product revealed a total of 58 mutations in 21 (88%) of 24 cases: 4 cases had a single mutation, 5 had 2 mutations, 5 had 3 mutations, 6 had 4 mutations, and 1 had 5 mutations. Although 31% of the mutations did not change an amino acid, every tumor had at least one mutation that did, which may have provided the selection pressure for expansion. The frequency of p53 gene mutation in sporadic soft tissue sarcomas was 20%. These findings highlighted the extraordinarily high frequency of p53 gene mutations in PRS. G:C to A:T transition at dipyrimidine sites was found in 14 (58%) of 24 cases. Collectively, these findings indicate that radiation is causative for soft tissue sarcomas via p53 gene mutations.

TI  - [Structural changes in membranes of proliferating leukocytes L-41 as affected by low doses of ionizing radiation]  
AB  - The dose-dependent effects of gamma-radiation on the leucocyte cultures L-41 has been investigated. Irradiation by the dose of 0.25 Gy stimulates the cell proliferation while that by the doses of 1.0 and 2.0 Gy inhibits this process. In this dose range the radiohormesis effects characterizing structural organization of the probed membranes have been also registered for fluorescence parameters. The zone of qualitative transition of response of the cell membranes to radiation is individual for various effects. The action of radiation in the doses of 0.25 and 0.50 Gy induces a decrease of ANS fluorescence intensity and a decrease of membrane protein immersion in the lipid bilayer of leukocyte membranes. The values of these parameters rise at the doses of 1.0 and 2.0 Gy that reflects different directions of structural changes in various membrane regions. The irradiation in the range of 0.25-1.0 Gy induces the increase of microviscosity in deep regions of membrane lipid matrix while at the dose 2.0 Gy it causes its decrease. Radioactive radiation does not change the membrane protein conformation of leukocytes and polarity of lipid bilayer hydrophobic zones as recorded by fluorescent methods used.

TI  - Radiation dose, chemotherapy and risk of osteosarcoma after solid tumours during childhood.  
AB  - Osteosarcoma is the most frequent second primary cancer occurring during the first 20 years following treatment for a solid cancer in childhood. Using a cohort study of children treated for a solid cancer, we investigated the incidence and etiology of osteosarcoma as a second malignant neoplasm after childhood cancer in a cohort and a case-control study. We analysed the relationship between the local dose of radiation and the risk of osteosarcoma, taking into account chemotherapy received. A cohort study of 4,400 3-year survivors of a first solid cancer during childhood diagnosed in France or the United Kingdom, between 1942 and 1986, revealed 32 subsequent osteosarcomas. In a nested case-control study, we matched 32 cases and 160 controls for sex, type of first cancer, age at first cancer and the duration of follow-up. Parameters studied were the incidence of osteosarcoma, the cumulative local dose of irradiation and the cumulative dose of chemotherapy received by cases and controls. The risk of a osteosarcoma was found to be a linear function of the local dose of radiation (excess relative risk per gray=1.8), and was found to increase with the number of moles of electrophilic agents per square meter but not with other drugs. No interaction was noted between radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Bilateral retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma were found to render patients susceptible to a higher risk of developing an osteosarcoma as a second malignant neoplasm. We recommend long-term surveillance of patients who were treated during childhood for bilateral retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, as well as other first cancer treated with radiotherapy plus high doses of chemotherapy, without focusing exclusively on the radiation field.

TI  - [Coronary stenosis following successful radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease]  
AB  - Three male patients, aged 43, 41 and 44 years, were referred to the cardiologist because of complaints of angina pectoris; one of them also had an aortic valve stenosis. Nine to 22 years before, they had received radiotherapy on the mediastinum because of Hodgkin's disease. Coronary angiography showed severe stenoses of the ostium of the right coronary artery or of the main left coronary artery, following which the patients were treated with coronary artery bypass surgery, aortic valve replacement and (or) drugs. These locations are very unusual in patients with angina who did not receive any radiation therapy, but they are seen frequently in patients who have received radiotherapy on the mediastinum. The pathogenesis of these lesions is not exactly known. The normal risk factors for atherosclerosis plus free oxygen radicals are probably involved. The free oxygen radicals, generated by radiation, locally activate coagulation via various hypothetical mechanisms. The damaging effect of radiotherapy could therefore be prevented by antioxidants. However, the therapeutic effect of radiation would most likely decrease as well. A more rational approach to prevent these vascular lesions would be to reduce the radiation load, to treat the risk factors for atherosclerosis and to give platelet aggregation inhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid.

TI  - The influence of pre-radiation salivary flow rates and radiation dose on parotid salivary gland dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers.  
AB  - Radiotherapy (RT) used for head and neck cancers causes permanent salivary gland dysfunction (SGD). Previous short-term studies have demonstrated that pre-RT salivary flow rates and the amount of radiation exposure to parotid glands influence the amount of RT-induced SGD. The purpose of this study was to determine which variables are related to the development of long-term post-RT SGD. Parotid flow rates (PFR) were assessed prior to and 1 year after completion of RT in spared parotid glands from 34 patients from 2 parotid-sparing protocols. The results reveal that spared PFR were not significantly higher 1 year post-RT in patients who had high pre-RT PFR, when compared with patients with low pre-RT PFR. However, patients who received higher doses of RT to spared parotid glands had lower PFR 1 year post-RT, compared with patients who had received lower doses of RT. These one-year findings suggest that high pre-RT PFR do not provide protection against RT-induced SGD. Conversely, reduced RT dosages to contralateral parotid glands are protective of PFR after completion of RT.

TI  - X-radiation induces 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine formation in vivo in rat mammary gland DNA.  
AB  - Ionizing radiation is a carcinogen that induces oxidative DNA damage. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a relatively abundant, mutagenic lesion that is widely regarded as a reliable index of oxidative DNA damage. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of X-radiation on levels of 8-OHdG in the context of an experimental model for breast cancer in which chronic radiation exposure has been shown to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. A secondary objective of this study was to determine if the use of phenol during DNA isolation affected the concentration of 8-OHdG subsequently measured. Our results indicate that a profoundly carcinogenic dose of radiation induced a small but significant increase in 8-OHdG concentration in mammary gland DNA, and that the use of a phenol-based versus a salt-based method of DNA isolation had no significant impact on the levels of 8-OHdG detected in either control or irradiated tissue.

TI  - Genetic mapping of soluble guanylyl cyclase genes: implications for linkage to blood pressure in the Dahl rat.  
AB  - The nitric oxide (NO) signaling system, consisting of NO synthases, soluble guanylyl cyclase, and cGMP, plays a prominent role in salt handling and regulation of blood pressure. Soluble guanylyl cyclases are heme-containing heterodimers (alpha/beta). The alpha1/beta1 isoform has greater NO sensitivity than the alpha1/beta2. It has recently been shown that expression of the beta subunits is altered in the kidney of the Dahl salt-sensitive rat, ie, the beta1 subunit is decreased and the beta2 subunit increased. However, whether soluble guanylyl cyclase is linked to salt sensitivity is not known. In the present study, we investigated linkage of guanylyl cyclase genes to blood pressure. Alpha1 and beta1 gene loci for soluble guanylyl cyclase were mapped to rat chromosome 2, and the beta2 gene locus was mapped to rat chromosome 5 using fluorescent in situ metaphase hybridization. By use of a rat radiation hybrid panel, the gene loci were then further mapped with respect to known quantitative trait locus markers of salt-sensitive hypertension in the Dahl rat on chromosomes 2 and 5. Genes for alpha1 and beta1 were closely linked by two-point analysis to Na+,K+-ATPase alpha1 isoform (LOD of 15.1 and 14.0, respectively) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-delta loci (LOD of 14.3 and 12.9, respectively), which have been previously shown to flank a quantitative trait locus for blood pressure in the Dahl rat. The alpha1 and beta1 genes were closely linked (LOD of 11.3; theta, 0.4). The beta2 gene locus was closely linked to the endothelin-2 (ET-2) locus (LOD of 13.0), which has been shown to cosegregate with blood pressure. We conclude that soluble guanylyl cyclase subunit loci, ie, alpha1, beta1, and beta2, are good candidates for genes controlling salt-sensitive hypertension in the Dahl rat.

TI  - Modest decline in late mortality following Hodgkin's disease in the southeastern Netherlands since 1972.  
AB  - Since prolonged remission can be induced in the majority of patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), treatment-related mortality and morbidity have emerged. We investigated whether awareness of toxicity diminished treatment-related mortality for unselected patients treated between 1972 and 1993 in general hospitals in the southeastern Netherlands. We also estimated the prevalence of treatment-related morbidity among patients treated in the 1980s. Data were collected on all 345 HD patients registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry between 1972 and 1993. Medical records and histology were reviewed; follow-up ended in 1994. Administration of MOPP chemotherapy decreased, and there was a shift from total nodal irradiation to less extended low-dose radiotherapy. For cured patients the 10-year relative survival improved from 84% in the 1970s to 90% in the 1980s, which is reflected by a decline in excess mortality from 16% to 10%. The 10-year relative mortality risk due to secondary malignancies decreased from 4.3 (95% CI, 1.2-7.4) to 3.0 (CI 0.2-5.8), which is also reflected by a decline in the 10-year cumulative incidence for all cancers from 10% to 5%. However, the relative risk of late cardiovascular death, which is closely related to previous irradiation, barely changed, as shown by a decrease from 2.4 (CI 0.4-4.5) to 2.2 (CI.0-4.7). HD survivors profited less from the sharp decline in cardiovascular mortality observed for the general population. Among patients, the prevalence of serious treatment-related morbidity 5 years or more after initial diagnosis was 34%. In conclusion, modest decline in excess mortality among cured HD patients was observed in the 1980s, as reflected by a decrease in mortality due to second malignancies. However, late mortality, especially due to radiation-related cardiovascular disease, is still substantial. About one third of HD survivors suffer radiation-induced sequelae. Clinical trials to find ways to minimize iatrogenic complications are important.

TI  - Flow cytometry measurements of subsets of T, B and NK cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes of atomic bomb survivors.  
AB  - Previous studies of blood cells from atomic bomb survivors have shown that frequencies of chromosome aberrations and somatic mutations are elevated in heavily exposed survivors and that T-cell functions and the number of mature T cells are decreased in the survivors who were exposed to radiation as adults. Current progress in flow cytometry allows a sophisticated analysis of various subsets of T, B and NK cells. In the present study, proportions of such subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes from atomic bomb survivors (159 survivors estimated to be exposed to > or =1.5 Gy) and 252 controls were measured using multiple combinations of monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte differentiation antigens to investigate whether the previous radiation exposure had altered the composition of the subsets. Among T-cell subsets, the proportion of CD4+ T-cell subsets was decreased significantly in the heavily exposed survivors; this tendency was apparent for the CD4+CD45RA+ naive T-cell subset. However, there were no significant differences in the proportions of CD8+ T-cell subsets between the exposed survivors and controls. As for the B-cell subsets, the proportion of both CD5+ and CD5 B cells as well as CD23+ and CD23- B cells increased in the heavily exposed survivors. Further, no effect of radiation was found in the proportion of NK-cell subsets. These results strongly suggest that previous radiation exposure altered the composition of T and B cells in the peripheral blood of atomic bomb survivors, and they raise the possibility that atomic bomb radiation may have affected the developmental processes of T and B cells.

TI  - Modulation of radiation-induced strand break repair by cisplatin in mammalian cells.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA lesions in human skin fibroblasts in the presence of cisplatin-DNA adducts and to determine the persistence of DNA repair inhibition by cisplatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human fibroblasts (AG 1522) treated with cisplatin were exposed to 4 Gy 60Co gamma-radiation and assayed for repair of radiation-induced damage under growth-permissive conditions. DNA damage was measured by the fluorescence analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) and cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assays. RESULTS: Rejoining of strand breaks caused by 4 Gy radiation in cells without cisplatin pre-treatment appeared to be biphasic with an initial fast component (up to 15 min of repair time) followed by a slower component, and was completed by 90 min. Cisplatin treatment (10 microg/ml, 30 min) immediately before irradiation had no effect on the fast rejoining component, but inhibited the slow component (p<0.01). The same cisplatin treatment 24 h prior to irradiation inhibited both slow and fast components (p<0.01). In contrast, decreasing the cisplatin exposure to 1.0 microg/ml for 30 min, 24h prior to irradiation, resulted in an increased amount of strand break repair at each time point measured compared with irradiated control cells. This mild cisplatin treatment (95% survival) also resulted in a reduction of radiation-generated micronuclei indicating an adaptive response. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin used in combination with ionizing radiation can produce differential cellular responses depending upon the severity of the cisplatin treatment and the time interval between cisplatin and radiation exposures.

TI  - Differential expression of selenoproteins by human skin cells and protection by selenium from UVB-radiation-induced cell death.  
AB  - The generation of reactive oxygen species has been implicated as part of the mechanism responsible for UVB-radiation-induced skin damage. In mice, evidence suggests that increased dietary selenium intake may protect skin from many of the harmful effects of UVB radiation. We sought to determine the selenoprotein profile of cultured human skin cells and whether selenium supplementation could protect keratinocytes and melanocytes from the lethal effects of UVB radiation. Labelling experiments using [75Se]selenite showed qualitative and quantitative differences in selenoprotein expression by human fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes. This was most noticeable for thioredoxin reductase (60 kDa) and phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (21 kDa); these proteins were identified by Western blotting. Despite these differences, we found that a 24 h preincubation with sodium selenite or selenomethionine protected both cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes from UVB-induced cell death. With primary keratinocytes, the greatest reduction in cell death was found with 10 nM sodium selenite (79% cell death reduced to 21.7%; P<0.01) and with 50 nM selenomethionine (79% cell death reduced to 13.2%; P<0.01). Protection could be obtained with concentrations as low as 1 nM with sodium selenite and 10 nM with selenomethionine. When selenium was added after UVB radiation, little protection could be achieved, with cell death only being reduced from 88.5% to about 50% with both compounds. In all of the experiments sodium selenite was more potent than selenomethionine at providing protection from UVB radiation.

TI  -  Combined preoperative radiation and mitomycin/5-fluorouracil treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of locally advanced rectal carcinoma, radiation therapy before surgery has been shown to decrease local recurrence rates, but has minimal effect on survival. Recently, chemotherapy in combination with preoperative radiation therapy has been shown to be effective for certain malignancies. We postulated that such combination therapy might improve the resectability of advanced rectal cancer. STUDY DESIGN: During a 4-year period we treated 20 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum using a protocol of preoperative simultaneous pelvic irradiation (4,030-6,040 cGy) and infusion chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 100 mg/m2 per day over 96 hours and mitomycin 10 mg/m2) followed by surgical resection. Effects of therapy on resectability, tumor size, recurrence and survival, and complications of treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Minimal toxicity was observed and all patients completed their scheduled preoperative therapy. Reduction in tumor size after chemoradiation, as measured by CT scan, averaged 61% (range 20-100%). Twenty percent had a complete pathologic response to preoperative therapy, with no tumor found in the surgical specimen. Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the 5-year survival was estimated to be 64+/-11%, and cancer free and local pelvic control rates were 41+/-12% and 88+/-8% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that preoperative combination radiation and chemotherapy may provide significant benefit for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, and that further, large scale studies of this treatment regimen are warranted.

TI  - Apoptotic repair of genotoxic tissue damage and the role of p53 gene.  
AB  - The spontaneous mutation rate per replication per genome is nearly invariant in microbes; however, the rate of spontaneous genomic mutations in higher eukaryotes is much higher. Furthermore, the mutation rates per locus per generation among Drosophila, mice and humans are similar, despite the large differences in generation time. A simple explanation for these findings is that mice and humans have a specific antimutagenic mechanism that is lacking in Drosophila. I propose that apoptotic repair-deletion of genotoxic damage-bearing cells-operates in mammalian germ cells and that it works more accurately in humans than in mice because of a slower rate of cell turnover and a longer generation time. It has been a long-standing puzzle that germline mutation frequencies decrease markedly as the dose-rate of radiation is lowered in mice but not in Drosophila. This can be readily explained by p53-dependent apoptotic repair, because the p53 gene is absent from the genome of Drosophila. Fetuses of p53+/+ mice have proficient apoptotic repair capacity for X-ray-induced teratogenic damage, but p53-null fetuses completely lack this capacity. Further, I propose that the primary role of the p53 gene is to guard germ cells and embryos from genotoxic damage. This implies that the tumour suppressor function of the p53 gene results from p53-dependent apoptotic deletion of cells with genotoxic damage. The reasoning behind this proposal is given by reviewing reports that Drosophila larvae are insensitive to tumour formation after irradiation. Finally, I discuss the genetic effects of radiation in humans. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intervention for pleural effusions and ascites following liver transplantation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small volumes of fluid in the pleural and peritoneal cavities are common after paediatric liver transplantation. Occasionally, larger fluid collections develop and need intervention by aspiration or insertion of a drain. Objective. To assess the incidence of moderate and large pleural and peritoneal fluid collections following paediatric liver transplantation, the need for intervention and the outcome following radiological and non-radiological treatment, with the ultimate objective of recommending a treatment protocol for such post-operative fluid collections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 184 consecutive liver grafts in 164 children were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 184 grafts, 31 (16.8%) developed excessive fluid collections requiring intervention (19 pleural effusions, 8 ascites and 4 effusions and ascites). The effusions were first diagnosed between days 1 and 44 after transplant and the ascites between days 1 and 14. The initial diagnosis was made radiologically in 21 (91%) of 23 pleural effusions and in 10 (83%) of 12 ascites. No identifiable cause or association was seen in 18 (58%) of 31 cases. The mean duration of the pleural effusions and ascites, from onset of treatment to resolution, ranged from 33 +/- 42 days (SD) to 35 +/- 48 days and from 36 +/- 47 days to 39 +/- 46 days respectively. Comparison of the modes of interventional treatment (i.e. unguided, radiological and surgical) showed no statistically significant difference in the outcome of the management. CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplantation pleural effusions and ascites requiring intervention are often without definite cause. They are more common with reduced grafts, but this cannot completely explain the occurrence or the protracted duration of accumulation in spite of combined interventional management. The outcome of treatment is not significantly influenced by the mode of intervention except in cases where surgical intervention is indicated. Patients could be managed effectively without resorting to chronic outpatient aspiration. US contributed significantly in the initial and follow-up evaluation of these patients, even in cases of pleural effusions, and we would recommend greater use of US in place of radiographs to reduce the radiation burden when fluid collections are protracted.

TI  - [Statistical analysis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma--multivariate analysis of prognostic factors and evaluation of therapeutic modalities]  
AB  - Ninety-one cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma initially treated at Keio University Hospital between July 1981 and June 1996 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 83 males and 8 females, aged from 29 to 83 years old, with an average age of 62.7. The primary lesion was located in the lateral wall in 52 patients (57.1%), the superior wall in 23 (25.3%), the anterior wall in 14 (15.4%) and the posterior wall in 2 (2.2%). Double cancer was detected in 21 patients (23.1%). The patients were divided into two groups according to the initial main treatment of the primary lesion without regard to chemotherapy: 72 patients (79.1%) who received curative radiotherapy with or without salvage surgery, and 14 patients (15.4%) who underwent curative surgery with or without preoperative and/or postoperative radiation. The remaining 5 patients were treated by chemotherapy alone. Prior to the above treatments 50 patients (54.9%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Survival distributions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method as univariate analysis, and compared by the generalized Wilcoxon test. The overall five-year cumulative survival rate was 55.6%. The five-year survival rates according to stage (UICC classification, 1987) were as follows: stage I (11 cases), 70.7%; stage II (12 cases), 63. 6%; stage III (30 cases), 52.3%; and stage IV (38 cases), 52.5%. Significant clinicopathological variables that influenced survival were: (1) T stage (p = 0.0075); (2) age (p = 0.0274); and (3) location of primary lesion (p = 0.0400). The results of multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional hazards model identified T stage as a significant independent prognostic factor. Evaluation of the therapeutic modalities led to the following conclusions. (1) Differences in the initial treatments of the primary lesion were not reflected in the outcome. (2) Salvage surgery for residual or recurrent tumor contributed to improving the survival. The superior wall type, in particular, seemed to be a good indication for salvage surgery. (3) Although the limitations of radiotherapy are not defined clearly, we have to determine the indications for radical resection of tumors resistant to radiotherapy with reconstruction. (4) The response rate of NAC reached 85.4%, but there were no significant differences in survival between the group that underwent NAC and the other group in any other subset analyses. (5) Among the patients who underwent NAC, the responder (CR + PR) group showed a better five-year survival rate (61.3%) than the non-responder (NC + PD) group (42.9%), but the difference was not significant.

TI  - Ancient large-scale genome duplications: phylogenetic and linkage analyses shed light on chordate genome evolution.  
AB  - Paralogous genes from several families were found in four human chromosome regions (4p16, 5q33-35, 8p12-21, and 10q24-26), suggesting that their common ancestral region underwent several rounds of large-scale duplication. Searches in the EMBL databases, followed by phylogenetic analyses, showed that cognates (orthologs) of human duplicated genes can be found in other vertebrates, including bony fishes. In contrast, within each family, only one gene showing the same high degree of similarity with all the duplicated mammalian genes was found in nonvertebrates (echinoderms, insects, nematodes). This indicates that large-scale duplications occurred after the echinoderms/chordates split and before the bony vertebrate radiation. It has been suggested that two rounds of gene duplication occurred in the vertebrate lineage after the separation of Amphioxus and craniate (vertebrates + Myxini) ancestors. Before these duplications, the genes that have led to the families of paralogous genes in vertebrates must have been physically linked in the craniate ancestor. Linkage of some of these genes can be found in the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, suggesting that they were linked in the triploblast Metazoa ancestor.

In this study we have used two model organisms (chicken and zebrafish) to show that hybrid panels that contain a full complement of the donor genome can be generated by fusion to hamster cells. The quality of the resulting hybrids has been assessed using PCR and FISH. We confirmed the utility of our panels by establishing the percentage of donor DNA present in the hybrids. Our hybrid resources will allow inexpensive gene mapping and we expect that this technology can be transferred to many other species.

TI  - ASTRO research fellowship: the role of BCL-2 and glutathione in an antioxidant pathway to prevent radiation-induced apoptosis.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene has been associated with resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis. There is evidence that the bcl-2 protein acts in an antioxidant pathway to block the effects of reactive oxygen species that mediate apoptosis possibly by increasing the levels of intracellular glutathione. Our hypothesis is that pretreatment of radiation-sensitive cells, known to lack bcl-2 expression, with antioxidants will reduce radiation-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, the apoptotic response to radiation and the intracellular levels of GSH were tested before and after pretreatment with antioxidants in two murine lymphoma cell lines, a radiation-resistant, bcl-2- expressing (LY-ar) line and a radiation-sensitive, non-bcl-2-expressing (LY-as) line. METHODS AND MATERIALS: LY-ar and LY-as cells were irradiated at 0,1,2,3, and 4 hours before collection. The intracellular levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were determined by the use of the fluorescent dye o-phthalaldehyde. LY-as cells were treated with GSH ethyl-ester for 1 and 2 hours after irradiation. Apoptotic response was measured by the DNA fragmentation assay.  The radiation dose was 2.5 Gy. RESULTS: After irradiation, the apoptotic rate of LY-ar and LY-as cells was 10-20% and 50-70% respectively. LY-ar cells had higher intracellular GSH and GSSG levels compared to LY-as cells by 69.9% and 91.9% respectively and the GSH/GSSG ratio in LY-ar and LY-as cells was 15.09 and 17.09 respectively. GSH levels did not change during the first 2 hours after irradiation; however, there was a 49% and 84% reduction at 3 and 4 hours after irradiation, respectively, times at which the LY-as cells have already fragmented their DNA. Treatment of LY-as cells with GSH ethyl-ester at a concentration of 7 mM for 1 and 2 hours resulted in 70% and 231% increases in the intracellular GSH levels respectively. Treatment of LY-as cells with GSH ethyl-ester for 1 and 2 hours also conferred a 25-50% decrease in their apoptotic response after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: GSH and GSSG levels are elevated in radiation-resistant, bcl-2-expressing murine lymphoma cells compared to radiation-sensitive, non-bcl-2-expressing cells. GSH levels decline only in radiation-sensitive cells after irradiation but this appears to occur at the time of apoptotic cell death. Exogenous thiols increase intracellular GSH levels and repress radiation-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, intracellular thiols appear to be involved in protecting cells from apoptotic cell death. Further investigation should be directed in identifying substances which by lowering intracellular thiols may result in sensitization to radiation.

TI  - Knowledge and perception regarding radiotherapy and radiation in patients receiving radiotherapy: a qualitative study.  
AB  - This study aimed to acquire information about the knowledge patients have about radiation and radiotherapy, and the sources and impact of this knowledge. Data collection was by semi-structured interviews with 30 randomly selected adult patients conducted during the first half of a course of radiotherapy. Data analysis used three major themes: language, understanding and sources of knowledge. Few interviewees had any idea of the physical characteristics of radiation treatment, or they found it difficult to explain. Knowledge about radiation use, other than for medical purposes, most commonly concerned the atom bomb. Patients understood radiotherapy in terms of its action on cancer. Almost all offered a sensible description of why radiotherapy was being used to treat their cancer. Most talked about radiation attacking their cancer in some way and many worried about its damaging effect. A third gave detailed information about what they had become aware of through the written press, or radio or television. The message taken from press reports was largely negative.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of p53 protein in non-small cell lung cancer and its prognostic value.  
AB  - Accumulation of mutant p53 protein occurs frequently in human malignancies, including 40-60% of non-small cell lung carcinomas. The implications of such p53 over-expression, usually assessed by immunohistochemical techniques, for the prognosis of lung cancer patients remain undetermined. In this study, we used a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay to measure p53 protein concentrations in extracts prepared from 86 primary non-small cell lung tumours and examined the associations between p53 protein levels (corrected for total protein) and other clinico-pathologic variables, including post-surgical disease-free and overall survival. Contingency tables analysed by chi2 tests revealed no significant relationships between p53 status, defined by a median cut-off point, and patient gender, age, disease stage, histologic grade and type, lymph node extension, smoking history and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. However, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship between p53 concentration, expressed as a 4-level, quartile-divided variable, and increased risk of relapse (p = 0.010) and death (p = 0.016). Patients whose tumours contained p53 concentrations exceeding the median value had over 3-fold higher risk of relapse (p = 0.002) and death (p = 0.007) than those whose tumours had lower p53 concentrations. We also provide evidence suggesting that the impact of p53 on survival is greater in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in those with adenocarcinoma. Although the latter finding needs confirmation, our results suggest that application of an immunoassay of p53 protein on non-small cell lung tumour extracts may identify patients at increased risk of unfavourable outcome.

TI  - Characterization and molecular analysis of Adh retrosequences in species of the Drosophila obscura group.  
AB  - Retrosequences, genes, and pseudogenes originated by retrotranscription are frequent components of vertebrate genomes, but they have only occasionally been described in invertebrates. In Drosophila, very few retrosequences have been reported, among them those of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and phosphoglyceromutase (Pglym). Although 52 Adh gene sequences are available for comparison, Adh retrosequences have been described only in the sibling species D. teissieri and D. yakuba (melanogaster subgroup) and in D. subobscura (obscura subgroup). Here, we report the presence of Adh retrosequences in two closely related species of D. subobscura: D. madeirensis and D. guanche. Extensive sequence comparisons with their functional paralogs suggest separate retrotranscriptional events: one in the melanogaster subgroup in the ancestor of D. teissieri and D. yakuba, and the other in the obscura subgroup before the radiation of the lineages leading to D. subobscura, D. madeirensis, and D. guanche. In the former, the Adh retrotranscript originated a new expressed gene, named jingwei. However, in the obscura Adh retrosequences, retention of codon bias and higher Ks than Ka values, both distinctive evolutionary features supporting functionality, have to be considered together with a frameshift, premature stop codons, and other nucleotide substitutions, which, added to the lack of the original promoter elements, suggest that they are pseudogenes. At least two different Adh retrosequences have been characterized in each of the obscura species, and their phylogenetic analysis indicates that paralogs and their flanking genomic regions share a higher degree of similarity than orthologous sequences. Two alternative hypotheses could explain this current organization and structure: either a multiplication event occurred independently in each species, or gene conversion events should be invoked after a single duplication in the species ancestor. The significance of retrotranscriptional events in the evolution of invertebrate genomes is discussed.

TI  - Radiobiological considerations in magna-field irradiation.  
AB  - Radiobiological considerations are described for total body irradiation (TBI) as given to patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Although much progress has been made in the use of BMT for refractory leukemias, many patients still die from interstitial pneumonia and relapse. Fractionated TBI has been introduced in order to improve leukemic cell kill, while increasing the degree of normal tissue tolerance. Traditionally, bone marrow stem cells, leukemic cells and immunocytes have been considered as having a limited ability to repair radiation damage while cells of lung tissue and intestinal epithelial cells have a greater capacity. During fractionated radiation therapy or continuous low-dose rate exposure, repair of sublethal damage between fractions allows greater recovery in the cell of lung tissue compared to those in the bone marrow. Clinically, the potential benefit of six fractions over one fraction or low dose-rate TBI has yet to be proved, although there is suggestive evidence for a reduced incidence of interstitial pneumonitis. However, other extraneous factors such as doses to the lung, differences in conditioning regimens, effect of increased delay in BMT for patients receiving fractionated TBI, and the unmeasurable differences between insitutions make definite conclusions impossible. Despite this, a consenus for dose fractionation has developed and most centers are moving away from the use of large single dose TBI.

TI  - [Platelet membrane glycoproteins in thrombocytapheresis and platelet concentrates]  
AB  - Membrane glycoprotein (GP) expression on platelets changes during preparation of concentrates and storage. Recent studies proved that the increased expression of the GMP-140 (CD 62), a GP appearing on platelets after activation, correlates with the in vivo recovery of transfused platelets. We therefore investigated the expression of this and three other GP (GP IIb/IIIa, GP, Ib, GP 53), detected by flow cytometry, in normal controls and in platelet concentrates prepared by four different methods (apheresis, preparation from buffy coat, from pooled buffy coat and platelet-rich plasma) after preparation and during storage. Furthermore we investigated the influence of filtration, radiation and washing platelet concentrates on the expression of GP. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The mean surface fluorescence (MF) is a better parameter for the evaluation of preparation and storage lesions than the total number of positive cells. (2) The mean fluorescence of GP Ib in platelet concentrates is generally lower than in normal controls and decreases continuously during storage; there is a small loss of GP Ib through washing and filtration. (3) GP IIb/IIIa fluctuates during preparation and storage, therefore it is not suitable for evaluation of quality. (4) The percentage of CD 62 positive cells and their mean fluorescence is higher in platelet concentrates than in normal controls and increases during storage continuously. There is a weak correlation of CD 62 with CD 63. (5) The changes of GP in apheresis concentrates and concentrates obtained from whole blood are similar after preparation and during storage.
