TI  - Renal depressor mechanisms of physical training in patients with essential hypertension.  
AB  - To clarify characteristics of the patients in whom exercise training lowers blood pressure and to elucidate the mechanisms by which exercise training lowers blood pressure, we evaluated 24-h blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal blood flow (RBF), filtration fraction (FF), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma norepinephrine concentration (PNE), and incremental area of insulin/glucose (sigmaI/sigmaG) during 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, and assessed arterial baroreceptor function (BSI) before and after a 3-week exercise training program (four 6-min sessions daily at 75% VO2 max). Patients were classified as responders (n = 15) if they showed statistically significant reduction in the multiple comparison of 24-h mean arterial pressure (MAP), or as nonresponders (n = 15) if they did not. Although there were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in age, weight, MAP, GFR, RBF, RPF, FF, PNE, sigmaI/sigmaG, or BSI before exercise, renal vascular resistance (RVR; P < .05), PRA (P < .05), and PAC (P < .05) were significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) (P < .05) were significantly lower in responders than in nonresponders. After exercise training, FF (P < .01), RVR (P < .05), PNE (P < .05) PRA (P < .01), and sigmaI/sigmaG (P < .05) decreased significantly only in responders. The decrease in MAP significantly correlated with the reductions in FF (r = 0.46, P < .05), PNE (r = 0.52, P < .01) and RVR (r = 0.40, P < .05). Thus, in patients who have higher RVR and PRA, exercise training lowered blood pressure in parallel to a reduction in RVR associated with decreases in sympathetic tone and improvement of insulin resistance. Our results suggest that exercise-induced changes in renal hemodynamics may contribute to the reduction in blood pressure in these patients.

TI  - Extracellular reduction of selenite by a novel marine photosynthetic bacterium.  
AB  - A novel purple nonsulfur bacterium strain NKPB030619, which has resistance to over 5 mM selenite, was isolated from a marine environment. An initial concentration of 1.1 mM selenite, added to the medium, was decreased to under 0.05 mM within 5 days. The color of the cell suspension turned red within 2 days. The red coloration gradually decreased and black precipitates appeared during 2 weeks of cultivation. Under these conditions, two main types of deposit were formed extracellularly. These deposits were thought to contain red amorphous selenium and black vitreous selenium.  The selenite reduction to elemental selenium in this bacterium was induced by the introduction of light and L-malic acid under anaerobic conditions. These results suggest that selenite reduction is coupled with photosynthesis and L-malic acid can serve as the indirect electron donor for its reduction. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA sequence showed that NKPB0360619 belongs to the alpha subdivision of Proteobacteria and is classified into the Rhodobacter species. The highest similarity of 86.2% was observed with R. sphaeroides.

TI  - Phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation of a model bacterial system to stressful thermal environments.  
AB  - We studied both phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation to various thermal environments using the bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental model system. We determined that 42 degrees C was stressful to a bacterial clone adapted to 37 degrees C, based on reductions in both absolute and competitive fitness, as well as induction of a heat stress response. This clone was also used to found replicated populations that were propagated for thousands of generations under several different thermal regimes, including 42 degrees C. Evolutionary adaptation of the populations to 42 degrees C resulted in an increase in both absolute and relative fitness at that temperature, measured respectively as an increase in the number of descendants (and their biovolume) and in competitive ability relative to the ancestral clone. The replicated experimental lineages achieved their evolutionary improvement by several distinct pathways, which produced differential preadaptation to a non-stressful nutrient environment. Adaptation to this stressful temperature entailed neither a change in the ancestral thermal niche nor any pronounced trade-offs in fitness within the thermal niche, contrary to a priori predictions. This study system was several important advantages for evaluating hypotheses concerning the effects of stress on phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation, including the ability to obtain lineages that have evolved in controlled and defined environments, to make direct measurements of fitness and to quantify the degree of stress imposed by different environments.

TI  - Partial recovery of erythrocyte glycogen in diabetic rats treated with phenobarbital.  
AB  - Erythrocytes may play a role in glucose homeostasis during the postprandial period. Erythrocytes from diabetic patients are defective in glucose transport and metabolism, functions that may affect glycogen storage. Phenobarbital, a hepatic enzyme inducer, has been used in the treatment of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), increasing the insulin-mediated glucose disposal. We studied the effects of phenobarbital treatment in vivo on glycemia and erythrocyte glycogen content in control and alloxan-diabetic rats during the postprandial period. In control rats (blood glucose, 73 to 111 mg/dl in femoral and suprahepatic veins) the erythrocyte glycogen content was 45.4 +/- 1.1 and 39.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/g Hb (mean +/- SEM, N = 4-6) in the femoral artery and vein, respectively, and 37.9 +/- 1.1 in the portal vein and 47.5 +/- 0.9 in the suprahepatic vein. Diabetic rats (blood glucose, 300-350 mg/dl) presented low (P < 0.05) erythrocyte glycogen content, i.e., 9.6 +/- 0.1 and 7.1 +/- 0.7 micrograms/g Hb in the femoral artery and vein, respectively, and 10.0 +/- 0.7 and 10.7 +/- 0.5 in the portal and suprahepatic veins, respectively. After 10 days of treatment, phenobarbital (0.5 mg/ml in the drinking water) did not change blood glucose or erythrocyte glycogen content in control rats. In diabetic rats, however, it lowered (P < 0.05) blood glucose in the femoral artery (from 305 +/- 18 to 204 +/- 45 mg/dl) and femoral vein (from 300 +/- 11 to 174 +/- 48 mg/dl) and suprahepatic vein (from 350 +/- 10 to 174 +/- 42 mg/ dl), but the reduction was not sufficient for complete recovery. Phenobarbital also stimulated the glycogen synthesis, leading to a partial recovery of glycogen stores in erythrocytes. In treated rats, erythrocyte glycogen content increased to 20.7 +/- 3.8 micrograms/g Hb in the femoral artery and 30.9 +/- 0.9 micrograms/g Hb in the suprahepatic vein (P < 0.05). These data indicate that phenobarbital activated some of the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism steps which were depressed in diabetic erythrocytes, supporting the view that erythrocytes participate in glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Topographical distribution of lactate dehydrogenase activity in human clear eye lenses and in lenses with different types of senile cataract: a histochemical investigation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Homogenates of human clear lenses show an age-dependent reduction of enzyme activities. Topographical patterns of enzymes in clear and cataractous lenses can be visualized by histochemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human lenses were characterized by slit-lamp investigations as bearing different types of senile cataracts. Subsequently, lenses were removed by intracapsular extraction. Clear human lenses served as controls. Bovine lenses served to standardize freeze-cutting and incubation for lactate dehydrogenase histochemistry. RESULTS: Bovine lenses show a sharp demarcation between the enzyme reaction of cortical fibers bearing cell nuclei and the non-reacting deeper fibers not exhibiting cell nuclei. Clear human lenses, lenses with deep supranuclear cortical cataracts, and lenses with nuclear cataracts exhibit the same borderline. However, in lenses with a subcapsular cortical cataract only the epithelium and a very thin layer of the most superficially located fibers show positive enzyme reactions. CONCLUSION: In growing clear human and bovine lenses, independent of age, the more peripherally located cortical fibers bearing cell nuclei exhibit strong enzyme-histochemical reactions. More centrally located lens areas lacking cell nuclei increase in volume in an age-dependent manner. These lens regions do not exhibit enzyme activities detectable by our histochemical technique. Therefore the lens areas free of histochemical reaction product become larger with increasing age, whereas the peripherally located lens fibers apparently do not change their enzyme activities with age. Thus, homogenates of total lenses show age-dependent reductions of enzyme activities, although enzyme activities remain at a physiological level in cortical lens fibers with recognizable cell nuclei. In lenses with immature supranuclear cortical and (particularly) in lenses with black nuclear cataracts, cortical fibers still can exhibit high enzyme activities. Unexpectedly, also ruptured and broken fibers in immature deep supranuclear cortical cataracts show strong enzyme activities. In contrast, in lenses with (incipient) subcapsular cortical cataracts only the most superficially located lens fibers exhibit some enzyme activity.

AB  - Alcoholics with depressive symptoms score > or = 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory (A.T. Beck, C. H. Ward, M. Mendelson, J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961) received 8 individual sessions of cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression (CBT-D, n = 19) or a relaxation training control (RTC; n = 16) plus standard alcohol treatment. CBT-D patients had greater reductions in somatic depressive symptoms and depressed and anxious mood than RTC patients during treatment. Patients receiving CBT-D had a greater percentage of days abstinent but not greater overall abstinence or fewer drinks per day during the first 3-month follow-up. However, between the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, CBT-D patients had significantly better alcohol use outcomes on total abstinence (47% vs. 13%), percent days abstinent (90.5% vs. 68.3%), and drinks per day (0.46 vs. 5.71). Theoretical and clinical implications of using CBT-D in alcohol treatment are discussed.

TI  - Phosphoserine/threonine phosphatases in the rat adrenal cortex: a role in the control of steroidogenesis?  
AB  - The involvement of protein kinases in the signal transduction pathways controlling adrenal steroidogenesis is well established, and the phosphorylation of substrates by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a major mechanism in ACTH action. However, the possibility that protein phosphatases (PPs) might also be involved in this process has not been investigated. The aim of this study was, therefore, to measure the function, expression and enzymic activity of PPs in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata/reticularis (ZFR) tissue from the rat adrenal cortex. Immunoblot analysis using specific antisera demonstrated the presence in whole adrenals and capsules of PP type 1 (PP1) migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa, and PP type 2A (PP2A) migrating with apparent molecular masses of 38 and 31 kDa. The PP inhibitors, okadaic acid (OA), calyculin A (CA), tautomycin and microcystin RR, caused a reduction in PP activity in vitro, at doses between 1 nM and 1 microM. In addition, treatment of ZG cells with the adenylate cyclase stimulator, forskolin (10 microM) resulted in a significant reduction in PP activity. The effects of CA and OA on steroid secretion by ZG and ZFR cells were also investigated. Neither CA nor OA had any effect on basal steroid secretion or on yields of steroid obtained from 22R-hydroxycholesterol at doses between 1 and 100 nM. However, both OA and CA (10 and 100 nM respectively) significantly reduced ACTH-stimulated aldosterone and corticosterone production by ZG and ZFR cells. CA and OA (10 and 100 nM respectively) also reduced steroid secretion by cells stimulated by forskolin (10 microM) or dibutyryl cAMP (200 microM). These results suggest that PPs may be involved in the intracellular mechanisms through which adrenocortical steroidogenesis is regulated, acting at a point after cAMP generation and action, but proximal to the side-chain cleavage of cholesterol.

TI  - Neurite differentiation is modulated in neuroblastoma cells engineered for altered acetylcholinesterase expression.  
AB  - Previous observations from several groups suggest that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) may have a role in neural morphogenesis, but not solely by virtue of its ability to hydrolyze acetylcholine. We tested the possibility that AChE influences neurite outgrowth in nonenzymatic ways. With this aim, antisense oligonucleotides were used to decrease AChE levels transiently, and N1E.115 cell lines were engineered for permanently altered AChE protein expression. Cells stably transfected with a sense AChE cDNA construct increased their AChE expression 2.5-fold over the wild type and displayed significantly increased neurite outgrowth. Levels of the differentiation marker, tau, also rose. In contrast, AChE expression in cell lines containing an antisense construct was half of that observed in the wild type.  Significant reductions in neurite outgrowth and tau protein accompanied this effect. Overall, these measures correlated statistically with the AChE level (p < 0.01). Furthermore, treatment of AChE-overexpressing cells with a polyclonal antibody against AChE decreased neurite outgrowth by 43%. We conclude that AChE may have a novel, noncholinergic role in neuronal differentiation.

TI  - Infarct size-reducing effect of ischemic preconditioning is related to alpha1b-adrenoceptors but not to alpha1a-adrenoceptors in rabbits.  
AB  - In rabbits and rats, both stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors and ischemic preconditioning (PC) reduce infarct size. Activation of alpha1b-adrenoceptors play an important role in the PC effect on ventricular function in rats. However, the alpha1-adrenoceptors have not been reported to be related to the PC effect in rabbits, because the infarct size-reducing effect of PC is not blocked by the nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine (POB) or by the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, BE2254. However, we speculated that alpha1b-adrenoceptors but not alpha1a-adrenoceptors may be related to the infarct size-reducing effect of PC in rabbit hearts. Thus we examined in rabbits whether the alpha1b-adrenoceptor blocker chloroethylclonidine (CEC), the alpha1a-adrenoceptor blocker 5-methylurapidil (5-MU), the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist bunazosin (BN), and the nonselective apha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (POB) can block the PC effect on infarct size. Eighty-eight anesthetized open-chest Japanese white male rabbits were subjected to 30-min coronary occlusion and 48-h reperfusion. In five PC groups, the rabbits were subjected to a single 5-min occlusion and 5-min reperfusion before 30-min sustained ischemia. In the PC groups, those with CEC (3 mg/kg, n = 10), 5-MU (3 mg/kg, n = 10), BN (0.3 mg/kg, n = 10), POB (4 mg/kg, n = 10), or placebo saline (n = 10) were pretreated before PC. In the non-PC groups, those with CEC (3 mg/kg, n = 7), 5-MU (3 mg/kg, n = 7), BN (0.3 mg/kg, n = 7), POB (4 mg/kg, n = 7), or placebo saline (n = 10) were pretreated before 30-min sustained ischemia. After a 48-h reperfusion, the infarct size was measured histologically and expressed as a percentage of the area at risk. PC caused a marked reduction of infarct size as compared with the non-PC control (10 +/- 3% vs. 42 +/- 2%; p < 0.05). The PC effect was completely blocked by CEC (36 +/- 2%) and by BN (42 +/- 4%) but not by 5-MU (14 +/- 1%) or POB (13 +/- 2%). None of the drugs by itself affected the infarct size. Stimulation of alpha1b-adrenoceptors but not of alpha1a-adrenoceptors during PC plays an important role in the PC effect on infarct size. This may explain the previous confusion concerning the PC blocking effect of various alpha1-blockers.

TI  - Redox-dependent conformational changes are common structural features of cytochrome c from various species.  
AB  - Discrepant results from X-ray crystallographic and physicochemical studies on the conformations of the two redox states of cytochrome c raise important questions about the nature of redox-dependent conformational changes and whether differences are common structural features of various cytochrome c species. Comparative studies of cytochrome c from 10 species (horse, cow, sheep, pig, dog, rabbit, chicken, pigeon, tuna, and baker's yeast) in aqueous solutions were carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The second-derivative analysis revealed similar conformational changes in all 10 species upon reduction of the heme iron regardless of the differences in the amino acid sequences. The redox-dependent changes involve the amide I regions ascribed to extended beta-structure, beta-turn, and alpha-helix structures. Three species (cow, sheep, and pig) with identical amino acid sequences displayed nearly identical infrared spectra for the oxidized and reduced states, which rules out the possible contribution of experimental error. These results show unequivocally that redox-dependent conformational changes are common structural feature of various cytochrome c species and demonstrate the usefulness of FT-IR spectroscopy as a quick and inexpensive tool in comparative studies of functionally related conformational changes of proteins.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of transurethral needle ablation of the prostate for symptomatic outlet obstruction [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine, in an observational study, the safety and efficacy of transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the prostate as a treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic enlargement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 71 symptomatic men with unequivocal obstruction on pressure-flow urodynamics. The variables measured at baseline and up to 12 months after treatment included the American Urological Association (AUA)-7 symptom index and an added quality-of-life question, the AUA BPH-Impact Index, a sexual function score, transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate, a frequency-volume chart, free-flow uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine volume (PVR) and pressure-flow urodynamics. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was offered if the symptoms failed to resolve at any time during the follow-up period. TUNA was performed under local anaesthetic and sedation in 63 (89%) men and as a day-case procedure in 10 (14%). Five patients were on warfarin which was not discontinued. RESULTS: There were no serious treatment-related adverse events. Eight of the initial nine patients who were not routinely catheterized after treatment with TUNA developed acute urinary retention. Although some haematuria occurred in all patients, only one (1.4%) developed catheter blockage by clot. There were no problems with bleeding in those patients on warfarin at the time of treatment. The mean (95% confidence interval, CI) AUA-7 index fell from 23 (1.7) to 10.6 (1.8) (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test) at 12 months, 29 men (41%) had an AUA-7 index of < or = 7. The maximum (95% CI) urinary flow rate increased from 9.0 (0.8) to 11.3 (1.1) mL/s (P < 0.001) and this was accompanied by a small but significant reduction in PVR of 70 (14) mL to 35 (8) mL (P < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test). There was a significant reduction in both maximal voiding pressure and detrusor pressure at peak flow at 3 months (Mann-Whitney U-test, both P < 0.001) and at 12 months (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test). However, 78% of the 45 men undergoing repeat pressure-flow studies at 12 months were unequivocally obstructed according to the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram. The mean (95% CI) prostatic volume fell from 49.0 (4.8) mL at baseline to 40.8 (4.9) mL at 3 months, but this change was not statistically significant (P = 0.011, Mann-Whitney U-test). Two men reported erectile dysfunction, one experienced ejaculatory problems and seven reported an improvement in erectile function after TUNA. During the study, 22 men (31%) underwent TURP. CONCLUSIONS: TUNA is a safe treatment which can be performed as an out-patient procedure under local anaesthesia and sedation in the vast majority of patients. There was no evidence of serious adverse events and no significant adverse effect on sexual function. The symptomatic improvement was sustained at 12 months in most (54%) patients, with modest improvements in peak flow rate, PVR and voiding pressures, indicating that TUNA may result in prolonged symptomatic improvement in a proportion of patients suffering from bladder outlet obstruction. A randomized controlled study against established therapies is now essential to clearly delineate its place in the management of such patients.

TI  - Nurse-led general surgical pre-operative assessment clinic.  
AB  - A nurse-led Pre-operative Assessment Clinic was introduced into the General Surgical Directorate at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in August 1993 to provide a general medical and anaesthetic pre-operative assessment, to give information, both written and verbal, to patients about their operations and to identify social problems which might delay discharge. Patients were seen either at the time of their original clinic appointment or subsequently on a recall basis, prior to admission to hospital. The clinic was run by two out-patient nurses working to agreed protocols. Patients were given written information leaflets in addition to a verbal explanation about their admission and operation. In order to assess the effectiveness of the clinic, a group of patients attending during the first year were compared with similar patients who did not undergo pre-operative assessment. A questionnaire of satisfaction with information received was completed and compliance with the clinic protocols was recorded. In the pre-operative assessment group, patients were more satisfied with the amount of information received and there were significantly fewer cancellations due to unforseen medical problems in this group. Eighteen per cent of investigations were repeated unnecessarily because the reports were unavailable or considered out of date. However, only 1% of patients pre-operatively assessed had their operations cancelled after their admission, compared with 6% of non pre-operatively assessed patients. Given the total number of patients admitted for surgical procedures per year, the introduction of comprehensive pre-operative assessment for all patients could result in a substantial reduction in cancellations following admission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the caries-reducing effect of an amine fluoride toothpaste when used under real-life conditions in a community preventive program. METHODS: Approximately 12,500 children 3-12 years of age were provided with toothpaste (four tubes or 360 grams annually during three years) to be used in kindergartens or schools and once a day at home. The teachers supervised daily toothbrushing sessions. Random samples of children in each of the ages 3, 6, 9, and 12 years were selected from the intervention and the reference communities at both the start of the study and after three years, and examined for dental caries experience. RESULTS: Amine fluoride dentifrice seemed to provide a reduction in dental caries prevalence compatible to the most commonly used fluoride dentifrice compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The implemented fluoride toothpaste program is a feasible and practical method of improving the oral health status of children.

TI  - Spontaneous reduction of a recurrent craniopharyngioma in an 8-year-old female patient: case report.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The spontaneous rupture of a craniopharyngioma is an extremely rare condition confined to adults. This is the first report of a patient younger than 10 years who experienced spontaneous reduction (possibly rupture) of a craniopharyngioma. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old female patient with a recurrence of a craniopharyngioma experienced fever, headache, and visual disturbance that lasted a few days. Concurrent with the improvement of these symptoms, marked reduction in the size of the tumor was revealed using magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting the occurrence of a rupture. INTERVENTION: Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region was performed while the patient received growth hormone therapy. CONCLUSION: There was no increase in the size of the tumor 1 year after the reduction occurred. Prompt evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary region using magnetic resonance imaging is warranted to rule out the possibility of spontaneous reduction (including rupture) of the tumor in a situation in which the patient with a craniopharyngioma shows meningeal signs or a rapid change of neurological symptoms (such as headache, fever, or visual disturbance).

Forty-six percent attended day care, 29% had >/=1 smoking parent, and 49% breastfed for </=2 months. Women were more knowledgeable about OM signs and symptoms than about risk factors. Mean OM knowledge score (the sum of correct true-false responses) was 7.0 (standard deviation = 1.6). Using multiple linear regression, knowledge score was significantly related to marital status, education, age, area of residence, breastfeeding (months), and number of cigarettes smoked per day by the mother, but not to infant or sibling OM history or day care attendance (R = .23). Infant history of OM (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.2) and white race (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0. 1 to 0.8), but not the presence of risk factors, were significantly related to having received clinicians' advice about OM prevention advice. CONCLUSION: OM education and prevention programs should target pregnant women and new mothers with OM risk factors, and those who are young, single, and less educated.

TI  - Anger management training in prison inmates.  
AB  - Inflicting harm on others after a perceived wrong is called revenge and has been implicated in a wide range of criminal and antisocial behaviors. Revenge is defined as a retaliatory act and may be ruled out when antecedent to instrumental aggression if hurting someone is secondary to the primary goal of acquisition. Revenge is considered the impetus for reactive aggression, however, if the primary goal is to hurt someone. 26 male inmates were chosen for training in anger management using cognitive behavioral methods. Selection of inmates was based on their history of reactive aggression. As predicted, inmates showed a significant reduction in posttest scores on the Vengeance scale.

TI  - Time course and localization of endothelin-1 gene expression in a model of renal disease progression.  
AB  - Experimental and human proteinuric glomerulopathies are associated with tubulo-interstitial injury that correlates with the decline of renal function even better than glomerular lesions do. Mechanism(s) leading to tubulo-interstitial damage are unknown. It has been proposed that excessive reabsorption of filtered proteins activates renal cells to produce vasoactive and inflammatory molecules including endothelin-1. The aim of the present study was twofold: we first evaluated the cellular origin of excessive renal endothelin-1 production in the renal mass reduction model and then related endothelin-1 distribution to the development of kidney lesions. Four groups of renal mass reduction (n = 15) and four groups of control rats (n = 5) were studied at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after surgery. Urinary proteins in renal mass reduction rats were comparable with controls at day 7 but became significantly higher thereafter. Renal mass reduction rats first developed tubulo-interstitial changes, which were already evident at day 14 in the majority of them. At 28 days, renal mass reduction rats also developed glomerulosclerosis. A parallel increase of renal endothelin-1 gene expression and synthesis of the corresponding peptide in renal mass reduction rats versus controls was observed from day 14. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization confirmed a pattern of endothelin-1 mRNA consistent with the distribution of lesions. At day 14, endothelin-1 staining was stronger in renal mass reduction than in control kidneys and mainly localized to the cytoplasm of tubular cells, whereas glomeruli were negative. At day 28, endothelin-1 expression further increased in renal mass reduction rats as compared with controls, and the staining was apparent also in glomeruli. Thus, in renal mass reduction, a progressive up-regulation of endothelin-1 occurs during the development of renal injury, that first involves the tubules and, only in a subsequent phase, the glomeruli.

TI  - Prednisolone alone, or in combination with estrogen or dietary calcium deficiency or immobilization, inhibits bone formation but does not induce bone loss in mature rats.  
AB  - Glucocorticoid use has long been recognized as a risk factor for bone loss, resulting in an increased fracture incidence in humans. However, steroid-treated patients often present with other complications that predispose to bone loss, such as immobilization, and little is known about the interaction of these other risk factors for bone loss and glucocorticoids. In the present study, mature female rats were treated with prednisolone (Pred) or vehicle, in combination with ovariectomy (ovx), dietary calcium deficiency (LoCa), or right hind limb immobilization (IM). After 4 weeks of treatment, the rats were killed and the right tibia and tibiofibular junction were collected for quantitative histomorphometric analysis and the right femur was collected for bone mineral density (BMD) and mechanical strength determinations. As expected, ovx, LoCa, and IM decreased BMD in the distal femur and cancellous bone volume (CnBV/TV) in the proximal tibia. All Pred-treated groups responded with increases of BMD and CnBV/TV, when compared to their respective non-Pred treated groups. Mechanical strength testing of the cancellous bone of the distal femur reflected the changes in BMD and CnBV/TV. No differences in trabecular plate thickness were noted in any of the treatment groups. The Pred group showed a significant reduction in longitudinal growth rate, as well as bone formation rate (BFR/BS), in the proximal tibia when compared with their respective control groups, the latter indicated by a decrease in both mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate. Most notably, osteoclast surface and urinary free pyridinoline, a bone resorption marker, increased significantly with each of the three risk factors. Pred treatment inhibited these increases but it did not exert significant reductions when used by itself. At the tibiofibular junction, there were no measurable changes in either total bone or cortical bone area. Endocortical BFR/BS were increased by ovx or LoCa but each was lowered by Pred treatment. Periosteal BFR/BS were increased by ovx and IM, and Pred exerted significant inhibition by itself and in combination with other risk factors. We conclude, therefore, that unlike the effects observed in humans treated with glucocorticoid, treatment of rats with prednisolone not only does not result in bone loss but may exert a protective effect on the skeleton through the inhibition of bone resorption.

TI  - A novel antioxidant gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [published erratum appears in J Exp Med 1998 Jan 5;187(1):141]  
AB  - Among the major antimicrobial products of macrophages are reactive intermediates of the oxidation of nitrogen (RNI) and the reduction of oxygen (ROI). Selection of recombinants in acidified nitrite led to the cloning of a novel gene, noxR1, from a pathogenic clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Expression of noxR1 conferred upon Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced ability to resist RNI and ROI, whether the bacteria were exposed to exogenous compounds in medium or to endogenous products in macrophages. These studies provide the first identification of an RNI resistance mechanism in mycobacteria, point to a new mechanism for resistance to ROI, and raise the possibility that inhibition of the noxR1 pathway might enhance the ability of macrophages to control tuberculosis.

TI  - Acute effects of exercise or sauna on appetite in obese and nonobese men.  
AB  - To study the effect of exercise on appetite in men, hunger, thirst, taste perception, energy intake, and macronutrient choice were assessed in relation to exercise and to sauna; the latter was done to correct for dehydration and rise in body temperature. Since exercise is used to prevent and cure obesity, subjects included obese as well as nonobese men. Thirty subjects (25 +/- 7 years, BMI 22.8 +/- 1.6 and 28.5 +/- 1.9) were given twice, in random order before and after 2 h of cycling at 60% of Wmax, 2 h of sauna, or 2 h of rest, an ample choice from solid and liquid almost single-macronutrient food items and a taste perception test with solutions of sucrose, citric acid, NaCl, quinine, a mixture of these, and a carbohydrate electrolyte solution. After cycling as well as after sauna, in comparison to after rest, subjects lost 3 +/- 0.5% of body mass, while thirst, fluid intake, perception of sweet at relatively low concentrations, and percentage of energy coming from carbohydrate increased significantly. Only after cycling compared to after rest did perception of bitterness at a low concentration increase and hunger and energy intake decrease. We conclude that exercise induced a short-term reduction in hunger and energy intake, whereas exercise and sauna induced a short-term increase in taste perception of sweet at the lower concentration, while macronutrient preference of carbohydrate increased.

TI  - The effect of ischemic preconditioning on the recovery of skeletal muscle following tourniquet ischemia.  
AB  - It has been well documented that ischemic preconditioning limits ischemic-reperfusion injury in cardiac muscle, but the ability of ischemic preconditioning to limit skeletal muscle injury is less clear. Previous reports have emphasized the beneficial effects of ischemic preconditioning on skeletal muscle structure and capillary perfusion but have not evaluated muscle function. We investigated the morphologic and functional consequences of ischemic preconditioning, followed by a 2-hour period of tourniquet ischemia on muscles in the rat hindlimb. The 2-hour ischemia was imposed without preconditioning, or was preceded by three brief (10 minutes on/10 minutes off) preischemic conditioning intervals. We compared muscle morphology, isometric contractile function, and muscle fatigue properties in predominantly fast-twitch, tibialis anterior muscles 3 (n = 8) and 7 (n = 8) days after ischemia-reperfusion. Two hours of ischemia, followed by reperfusion, results in a 20 percent reduction of muscle mass (p < 0.05) and a 33 percent reduction in tetanic tension (p < 0.05) when compared with controls (n = 8) at 3 days. The same protocol, when preceded by ischemic preconditioning, results in similar decreases in muscle mass and contractile function. Neuromuscular transmission was also impaired in both ischemic groups 7 days after ischemia. Nerve-evoked maximum tetanic tension was 69 percent of the tension produced by direct muscle stimulation in the ischemia group and 65 percent of direct tension in the ischemic preconditioning/ischemia group. In summary, ischemic preconditioning, using the same protocol reported to be effective in limiting infarct size in porcine muscle, had no significant benefit in limiting injury or improving recovery in the ischemic rat tibialis anterior. The value of ischemic preconditioning in reducing imposed ischemic-reperfusion-induced functional deficits in skeletal muscle remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - [Aplastic anemia: a model for its induction by oral and subcutaneous benzene in rats]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To set up the experimental conditions to induce aplastic anaemia in rats by oral and subcutaneous administration of benzene. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 6 groups with 6 male Wistar rats weighting 150 g each were formed. Each group with different conditions; 3 of them as experimental groups: 1) ES group (benzene 2 mL/Kg supplied subcutaneously), 2) EOI and 3) EOII groups (benzene 1.14 and 2 mL/Kg supplied orally); and 3 groups as control: 4) TS and 5) TO groups (supplied only with the vehicle subcutaneously. and orally, respectively) and 6) C group without treatment. Benzene was supplied during four weeks. Blood counts were done at 0, 15 and 30 days of treatment. EOI and EOII treatment was interrupted because of a severe damage to rats and the other groups except TO group continued until 60 days. When the treatment ended haematological determinations continued for 60 days every two weeks including osmotic fragility test and bone marrow smears in order to observe permanent changes. RESULTS: The rats treated with benzene 4 weeks showed a reduction in concentration of haemoglobin, bleeding of nasal and gastric mucosae, thrombocytopenia, microcytosis and macrocytosis in EOI and EOII groups respectively. The animals treated with benzene 60 days (ES) showed persistent reduction in haemoglobin and platelet concentration, macrocytosis and lymphopenia until day 60. On the other hand, the neutrophil concentration kept lower than the controls after day 75. In these animals blast cells and increased peroxidase positive cells were seen in peripheral blood. Also an increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes was observed and the bone marrow exhibited deep hypocellularity until day 120. CONCLUSION: The administration of benzene subcutaneously damaged irreversibly the myeloid progenitor cells, causing permanent reduction in concentration of erythrocytes, platelets and neutrophils. These results are similar to those reported with the inhalatory exposition to benzene. With the method here assayed long periods of treatment and expensive and sophisticated experimental conditions are avoided.

TI  - Measurement of total body water content in horses, using deuterium oxide dilution.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure total body water (TBW) content in horses, using deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution. ANIMALS: Six 8- to 10-year-old healthy untrained mixed-breed horses, weighing (mean +/-SD) 503.4 +/- 64.0 kg. PROCEDURE: After a 12-hour nonfeeding period, 6 horses were given D2O (0.14 g/kg of body weight) via nasogastric tube. Blood samples were collected from a preplaced indwelling jugular vein catheter prior to and 1 to 8, 10, 12, 14, and 24 hours after administration of D2O. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately, and plasma was collected and stored at -70 C until analysis. The D2O content in plasma was measured by zinc reduction to deuterium gas. The resulting gas was measured, using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Deuterium oxide was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of all horses, and reached peak (mean +/- SD) plasma concentration (1,454.4 +/- 163 delta D/ml or parts/thousand) 1 hour after administration. Plasma concentration decreased slowly during the next 2 to 3 hours, then remained statistically constant from 2 to 5 hours (early plateau phase) and 3 to 7 hours (late plateau phase) after administration. Mean +/- SEM TBW content was 623.0 +/- 2.2 ml/kg (62.3% of body weight) for the early plateau phase and 630.3 +/- 2.2 ml/kg (63.0% of body weight) for the late plateau phase. CONCLUSION: Deuterium oxide dilution appears to be of value for measurement of TBW content in horses, and has a 4-hour plateau effect. Equilibration of D2O with large intestinal water may be the reason for the prolonged equilibrium time and plateau effect seen in these horses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Deuterium oxide appears safe and efficacious for determining TBW content in horses and may be helpful for determining changes in TBW content during exercise and disease.

TI  - Long-term recovery of macrobenthos and fish assemblages after water pollution abatement measures in the River Petite Baise (France).  
AB  - Riverine ecosystems are subject to a large variety of man-made influences, and in recent years a new public awareness of the need to protect rivers has emerged within the industrialized world. The present study focuses on the effect of abatement of pollution from one factory on the recovery of fish and macroinvertebrate species richness in the River Petite Baise over a 20-year period (1973-1993). Until 1973, the Petite Baise (75 km in length) received not only factory waste (nitrogenous rich effluents) but also the untreated sewage of many villages and agricultural runoff from the river's catchment. In 1970, macroinvertebrates and fishes were absent in the river despite having initially been classified as of the barbel Barbus barbus zone, and extensive efforts were made by the factory to reduce pollution to allow the riverine community to recover. Regular surveys between 1973 and 1993 revealed a progressive improvement in water quality and the recolonization of the river by macrobenthic and fish populations. Macrobenthic fauna species richness gradually increased from zero in 1970 to level 8 or 9 in 1993 (Verneaux and Tuffery method), reflecting improvements in river water quality. Fish were not observed until 40 km downstream of the factory in 1978, 16 km in 1980, and approximately 5 km by 1990. Fish species richness increased from five in 1978 (barbel, chub Leuciscus cephalus, stone loach Barbatula barbatula, minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, gudgeon Gobio gobio) to eight in 1990 (the carnivorous brown trout Salmo fario, the omnivorous chub, and six benthophagous fishes: gudgeon, barbel, minnow, stone loach, sofie Chondrostoma toxostoma, carp Cyprinus carpio). Fish biomass 45 km downstream the factory increased from 1 g/m2 in 1978 to more than 5 g/m2 by 1990. Recolonization of the river, in particular those areas furthest downstream from the factory, occurred as a result of reductions in the nitrogen inputs emanating from the factory.

TI  - Nitro reduction as an electronic switch for bioreductive drug activation.  
AB  - It is well known that the reduction of aromatic nitro groups can give rise to toxic species, and that net nitro reduction by one-electron reductases can usually be inhibited by oxygen. There has been much interest in utilizing this biotransformation to activate drugs in hypoxic regions of tumors, but no clinically useful compound has yet resulted. Nitroreductive activation of prodrugs by oxygen-insensitive (and oxygen-sensitive) reductases is also of current interest because of new methods for introducing specific nitroreductases into tumors (e.g., as antibody-enzyme conjugates or by gene therapy). In most of the compounds investigated previously, cytotoxicity appears to be due to reactive nitroso or hydroxylamine reduction products arising from the nitro group itself. It is argued that there is greater scope for designing potent and selective nitro compounds by using the nitro group as an electronic switch to activate a latent reactive moiety elsewhere in the molecule. Examples of this approach include the nitro(hetero)aromatic mustards (e.g., SN 23816, NSC 646394) in which the nitro group controls the reactivity of a nitrogen mustard to which it is directly conjugated, and the nitro(hetero)aromatic methylquaternary (NMQ) mustards (e.g., SN 25341, NSC 658926) in which reduction of the nitro group triggers fragmentation of the molecule to release a reactive aliphatic nitrogen mustard. Many of these compounds show very high selectivity for hypoxic cells in culture. Some are also active against hypoxic cells in tumors, and provide large tumor growth delays when combined with tumor blood flow inhibitors such as 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). These prodrug designs also have potential for releasing effectors other than nitrogen mustards, which opens up many possibilities for use of nitro compounds as tumor-selective prodrugs.

TI  - Lung and chest wall mechanics in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). In 12 mechanically ventilated patients, total respiratory system mechanics was assessed using the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant flow inflation, and was partitioned into lung and chest wall components using the oesophageal balloon technique. We measured interrupter resistance (Rint), which mainly reflects airway resistance, additional resistance (deltaR) due to viscoelastic behaviour and time constant inequalities, and static elastance (Est). In addition, the static inflation volume-pressure (V-P) curve was assessed. In eight patients, computed tomography scans were performed within 2 days of the assessment of respiratory mechanics. Compared to values reported in the literature for normal subjects, Est and deltaR were markedly increased in AIDS patients with PCP, whilst Rint exhibited a relatively smaller increase. These changes, which involved only the lung and airways, were mainly due to the reduction of ventilated lung units, but additional factors were involved to cause independent modifications of lung stiffness, airway calibre, and viscoelastic properties. The changes in Rint, deltaR, and Est were similar to those observed in other studies on patients with ARDS of different aetiologies. At variance with common observations in the latter patients, none of the AIDS patients with PCP exhibited an inflection point on the static inflation V-P curve, suggesting little or no alveolar recruitment during lung inflation. This finding could be related to the distinctive histopathology of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Indeed, computed tomography revealed homogeneous diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltration rather than the dense, dependent opacities observed in other studies on acute respiratory distress syndrome of different aetiologies.

TI  - Impact of mutations at the P4 and P5 positions on the reaction of antithrombin with thrombin and elastase.  
AB  - Antithrombin (AT) is a serpin capable of trapping thrombin (IIa) in a stable and covalent complex. Complex formation is prevented by leukocyte elastase (LE) cleavage near the AT reactive centre. We mutated the known LE cleavage sites of AT to explore the possibility of producing an LE-resistant AT molecule. Initially, six rabbit AT variants differing only at residue 390 (P4) were generated in a cell-free system, and gel-based assays were used to assess IIa-mediated complex formation and LE-mediated cleavage of the variants. Substitution of charged residues (Glu or Arg) reduced complex formation by 50-60%, while the Ser variant was incapable of inhibiting thrombin; LE reactivity was less affected. The least (Trp) and most (Ser) affected variants were expressed in COS-1 cells. Again, the Ser variant was incapable of detectably reducing the rate of thrombin-mediated amidolysis while the Trp variant inhibited thrombin at a slightly reduced rate (-28%). LE inactivated the Trp variant and the wild-type AT to a similar extent. Recreation of the Trp mutation in COS-derived human AT showed similar results. Since retention of LE-sensitivity could have arisen due to cleavage at Val389 (P5), we produced and characterized a human AT substitution mutant with Trp at both P4 and P5. This variant showed a slight reduction in thrombin inhibitory activity (-22%), but remained susceptible to LE inactivation. These results suggest either that LE cleaves at secondary sites if its primary cleavage sites are blocked, or that the substrate specificity of LE differs in polypeptides as compared to peptide substrates.

TI  - Cholesterol and atherosclerosis: a contemporary perspective.  
AB  - Monumental advances in the field of lipid metabolism and its relationship to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been achieved during the last half century. Epidemiologic studies have defined lipid disorders as highly significant independent risk factors for coronary heart disease, along with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking. Primary and secondary prevention studies including the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, Helsinki Heart Study, and the Coronary Drug Project have shown that lowering the atherogenic low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) whilst raising the high density lipoproteins (HDL) significantly decreases the risk for coronary disease. Striking evidence that aggressive therapy (to sharply lower LDL and raise HDL with newer drugs) prevents progression and induces regression of coronary narrowing has been obtained in numerous recent studies using quantitative coronary arteriography. An interesting and unexpected lesson learned from these arteriographic studies was that a highly significant reduction within months in several studies in coronary events was out of proportion to improvements in luminal narrowing. Recently, three major clinical trials to assess the effects of cholesterol reduction by the newly discovered HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been published. Pravastatin significantly reduced coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients [mean LDL-Chol. = 5.0 mM/L (192 mg/dl)] without a history of myocardial infarction. In a secondary prevention study, simvastatin also reduced coronary complications in hypercholesterolemic patients [mean LDL-Chol. = 4.9 mM/L (190 mg/dl)] with pre-existing coronary disease. Very recently, pravastatin treatment significantly reduced coronary events and stroke in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and average cholesterol levels [mean LDL-Chol. = 3.6 mM/L (139 mg/dl)], representing the majority of patients with coronary disease. In all these studies, reduction in cardiovascular events was approximately one-third. In subgroup analyses, men, women, elderly, smokers and hypertensives benefited from cholesterol lowering. There was no significant increase in non-cardiovascular causes of death. In the United States of America, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel, representing major health organizations, developed national guidelines on the detection, evaluation and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults. In a given patient, the Panel recognizes the importance of weighing all cardiovascular disease risk factors including age (men > 45 years, postmenopausal women), family history of premature coronary disease, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and HDL-Cholesterol (< 35 mg/dl) in determining how aggressive therapy should be. The patient with manifest coronary heart disease (CHD) is given a special position as such patients are at highest risk for recurrent events. Major goals of therapy are to lower the LDL-Cholesterol to 2.6 mM/L (< 100 mg/dl) in the CHD patient. In non-CHD patients with two or more risk factors, the LDL-Cholesterol goal is 3.4 mM/L (130 mg/dl). In those with fewer risk factors, the goal is 4.2 mM/L (160 mg/dl). These guidelines should be modified as appropriate for Singapore. Patients with elevated triglycerides usually have low HDL-Cholesterol levels and often represent a heterogeneous group who may have other concurrent abnormalities including the presence of small dense LDL, insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, overt diabetes and combined hyperlipidemia. Such patients merit individualized treatment. The prevalence of this syndrome may be more common in Singapore and requires further investigation. Current therapeutic guidelines emphasize the need for weight loss and die

TI  - [Cabergoline in the inhibition of lactogenesis and suppression of lactopoiesis]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: 1) Evaluate the capacity of cabergoline to inhibit lactogenesis by the administration of a single dose of 1 mg within 24 h of birth, primary inhibition. 2) Evaluate the capacity of cabergoline to suppress lactopoiesis (lactation) by the administration of 0.25 mg twice a day for 2 days, secondary inhibition. 3) Evaluate the collateral effects of cabergoline at these two doses. 4) Evaluate the reduction rate of prolactin (PRL) at 4 and 14 days after cabergoline administration. EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL: A prospective study was performed from 1/2/1995 to 31/1/1996 in 100 puerperae with indications for lactation with follow-up at 4 and 14 days after drug administration. The study was performed in the Division of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Sanremo Hospital in collaboration with the Analysis Service. RESULTS: Cabergoline inhibited primary and secondary lactation in all the puerperae examined. In 92% of cases lactation was suppressed following a single dose whereas a second treatment cycle was required in 8%. Twenty-two cases reported slight collateral effects without the need to resort to additional treatment. In 4 cases the collateral effects were of moderate intensity and it was necessary to administer symptomatic treatment. Mean levels of serum PRL at 4 and 14 days after cabergoline administration were respectively 12.5 and 18.2 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Cabergoline, a new dopaminergic drug with long-term inhibition of PRL production and secretion, can inhibit lactogenesis and lactopoies in 92% of cases at a dose of 1 mg; it can reduce long-term PRL levels (18.2 ng/ml) and in 4% it is necessary to resort to symptomatic treatment of the undesirable effects caused.

TI  - Malaria toxins: effects on murine spleen and bone marrow cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro.  
AB  - The ability of deproteinated malaria exoantigens from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf-MT) and P. berghei ANKA (PbA-MT) to activate murine haematopoietic cells was analysed in vitro. Malaria toxins (MT) of both plasmodium species induced cell proliferation and the production of IFN-gamma in overnight and long-term (5 days) spleen and bone marrow cultures and a reduction of the number of TNF-alpha spot forming cells (SFC). When added to cells of malaria-experienced animals, MT decreased the number of IL-4 SPC and increased the number of IL-5 SPC. However, the same proliferative and IFN-gamma induction properties as in naive cells were observed. Simultaneous addition of IL-2 and PbA-MT to spleen cells inhibited the proliferation but increased the IFN-gamma production usually induced by IL-2. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the addition of MT triggered an expansion of CD3+ and GR1+ cell populations. Our results suggest that malaria toxins of different species can induce an immediate and strong proliferation and a TH1-type cytokine release by murine cells, independently of previous in vivo priming.

TI  - Resorption of hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite ceramic coatings on weight-bearing implants: a quantitative and morphological study in dogs.  
AB  - Resorption (defined as loss of ceramic coating because of cellular activity or dissolution) of ceramic coatings is a matter of concern for the long-term performance of ceramic-coated implants. A new fluorine-containing coating, fluorapatite (FA), has been shown to be more stable than hydroxyapatite (HA) in unloaded models. In a weight-bearing model in trabecular bone, we evaluated loss (defined as reduction of coating irrespective of type of mechanism) of HA and FA coatings during 25 weeks of implantation. Eight mature dogs had HA- or FA-coated implants inserted bilaterally into the weight-bearing region of the medial femoral condyle. Quantified loss of ceramic coating was estimated at the light microscopic level using stereological methods. The experiment showed significant loss of both types of coatings. However, no statistical difference in loss of ceramic coating was found regarding surface area implant coverage, volume, and thickness (p = 0.77, p = 0.13, p = 0.56, p = 0.23, respectively). Completely resorbed HA coating was replaced by 36 +/- 6.0% (range: 26-42) bone in direct contact with the implant surface compared with 29 +/- 16.0% (range: 12-59) for FA (p = 0.40), suggesting that the implant was firmly fixed despite loss of the ceramic coating. Transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy spectroscopy and electron spectroscopic imaging showed that osteclast-like cells, osteocytes, macrophage-like cells, and fibroblasts had phagocytosed calcium-containing fragments, indicating cell-mediated resorption of the ceramic coating.

TI  - Quality and outcomes management in gastroenterology.  
AB  - The delivery of medical care is undeniably changing. Resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and the progressive rise of health care expenditures needs to be restrained. Although the field of outcomes assessment is not well understood, it is increasingly being applied to the practice of medicine. The underlying goal of outcomes management should be to improve quality by identifying the most efficient use of finite resources and integrating these into practice guidelines. Although reduction of health care costs is important, it should be a secondary goal. Providers of health care must take an active role in outcomes research and management both in understanding and in implementing these techniques in medical practice. In doing so, it is essential that physicians maintain the proper emphasis on quality patient care.

TI  - Assessing physical status in Alzheimer disease research.  
AB  - In Alzheimer disease (AD), physical health problems can result from coexisting illness that is independent of the AD or can result directly from the consequences of the brain disease. Most of these physical health problems are not unique to AD, but they may have more functional impact in adults with AD. Coexistent or comorbid diseases may contribute directly to the outcomes of medical treatment. In future effectiveness studies in AD, in addition to measuring the severity of the AD, the presence and severity of coexisting illness should also be evaluated. In addition to accounting for comorbidity as part of AD effectiveness research, the reduction of comorbid physical illness may also be a legitimate independent outcome measure to target in the effectiveness of the clinical care provided to patients with AD. Examples of existing measures of comorbidity include the Charlson comorbidity index and the Greenfield index of coexistent disease. These existing measures of comorbid medical illness focus on system diseases and may not be applicable to the types of comorbid problems important to the AD patient. Further understanding of coexistent illness in AD may require the development of new measures of the cumulative occurrence of comorbid illness in this population.

TI  - Flow cytometric analysis of reticulated platelets: evidence for a large proportion of non-specific labelling of dense granules by fluorescent dyes.  
AB  - The labelling of platelets with thiazole orange (TO) has been utilized by various laboratories to determine the percentage of reticulated platelets within whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A proportion of TO labelling, however, is not entirely mRNA specific and remains to be fully defined. Almost half of the total TO-positive signal within normal platelets (n = 5) was shown to be abrogated upon degranulation with 80 microM thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) (P = 0.006), strongly suggesting that platelet granules are non-specifically labelling with dye. We have confirmed this hypothesis by studying TO labelling of platelets within whole blood from dense granule deficient patients, e.g. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) (n = 5) and storage pool disease (SPD) (n = 4). The levels of TO-positive platelets were found to be significantly lower than normal (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0002 respectively), but not significantly different from TRAP degranulated platelets. Upon degranulation of HPS and SPD platelets there was very little further reduction in the TO signal. Incubation of normals and SPD whole blood with different concentrations of either TO or coriphosphine-O confirmed that dense granules were non-specifically labelling even at high concentrations of both dyes. These findings suggest that although TO labelling is in part RNA specific, the dense granular pool of nucleotides appears to cause a substantial amount (approximately 50%) of non-specific labelling observed under these conditions of assay. This can easily be controlled for by a degranulation step with a non-enzymatic platelet agonist such as TRAP, and may have important consequences for the eventual standardization. clinical utilization and automation of reticulated platelet assays.

TI  - The reduction potential of cytochrome b5 is modulated by its exposed heme edge.  
AB  - When the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 is measured with the aid of several different surface-modified electrodes that function on the basis of electrostatic interactions with the protein, the resultant values have been consistently more positive (40-100 mV) than the reduction potentials measured with potentiometric methods. In this paper, we report that the heme edge containing the exposed heme propionate, a heme methyl, and a heme vinyl, and which constitutes part of the surface of cytochrome b5, modulates its reduction potential. The positive shifts observed in the voltammetric measurements appear to originate from the formation of a complex between cytochrome b5 and the modified electrode surface which (a) neutralizes the charge on the heme propionate located on the exposed heme edge and (b) lowers the dielectric of the exposed heme microenvironment by excluding water from the complex interface, factors which result in the destabilization of the positive charge on the ferric heme with respect to the neutral ferrous heme. The observed positive shift, which is induced by complexation at the electrode surface, may indicate that similar shifts in the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 occur when it forms a complex with physiological partners, prior to electron transfer. The effect of the value of the dielectric constant on the reduction potential of cytochrome b5 was corroborated by preparing the V45L/V61L double mutant whose reduction potential was measured to be 50 mV more negative than the value measured for the wild type protein. The negative shift in the reduction potential of the mutant protein was explained by the increased accessibility of water to the heme binding site, as observed in its X-ray crystal structure.

TI  - Impaired activity of the bile canalicular organic anion transporter (Mrp2/cmoat) is not the main cause of ethinylestradiol-induced cholestasis in the rat.  
AB  - To test the hypothesis that impaired activity of the bile canalicular organic anion transporting system mrp2 (cmoat) is a key event in the etiology of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in rats, EE (5 mg/kg subcutaneously daily) was administered to male normal Wistar (NW) and mrp2-deficient Groningen Yellow/Transport-deficient Wistar (GY/TR-) rats. Elevated plasma bilirubin levels in GY/TR- rats increased upon EE-treatment from 65 +/- 8.4 micromol/L to 183 +/- 22.7 micromol/L within 3 days, whereas bilirubin levels remained unaffected in NW rats. Biliary bilirubin secretion was 1.5-fold increased in NW rats but remained unaltered in GY/TR- rats. Plasma bile salt concentrations remained unchanged in both strains, although hepatic levels of the sinusoidal Na+-taurocholate cotransporting protein (ntcp) were markedly reduced. Biliary secretion of endogenous bile salt was not affected in either strain.  A clear reduction of mrp2 levels in liver plasma membranes of NW rats was found after 3 days of treatment. The bile salt-independent fraction of bile flow (BSIF) was reduced from 2.6 to 2.0 microL/min/100 g body weight in NW rats with a concomitant 62% reduction of biliary glutathione secretion. The absence of mrp2 and biliary glutathione in GY/TR- rats did not prevent induction of EE-cholestasis; a similar absolute reduction of BSIF, i.e., from 1.1 to 0.6 microL/min/100 g bodyweight, was found in these animals. EE treatment caused a reduction of the maximal biliary secretory rate (S(RM)) of the mrp2 substrate, dibromosulphthalein (DBSP), from 1,040 to 695 nmol/min/100 g body weight (-38%) in NW rats and from 615 to 327 nmol/min/100 g body weight (-46%) in GY/TR- rats. These results demonstrate that inhibition of mrp2 activity and/or biliary glutathione secretion is not the main cause of EE-induced cholestasis in rats. The data indicate that alternative pathways exist for the biliary secretion of bilirubin and related organic anions that are also affected by EE.

TI  - Restoration of the spinal canal by the internal fixator and remodeling.  
AB  - It has been observed that after reduction of an unstable vertebral fracture, treated either conservatively or operatively, the encroachment of the spinal canal remaining after reduction can decrease considerably with time. A series of 31 cases, each with a set of CT scans taken preoperatively, immediately after surgery and after implant removal respectively, was assessed using computer-aided planimetry. The mean initial narrowing of the spinal canal was 44.6%. Through surgery this was decreased by 20.4%, leaving a remaining deficit of 24.2%. After implant removal, 15 months after trauma and surgery, the area of the spinal canal increased a further 17.4%, leaving a remaining deficit of only 6.8%. Comparing the values of the spinal canal for T12-L5 directly after surgery and after implant removal, an almost identical degree of restoration for each level can be seen. This additional and gradual restoration of the spinal canal is termed remodeling. This study demonstrates that a residual postoperative narrowing of the spinal canal of up to 25% can be ignored, provided there is no initial neurologic damage.

TI  - Effect of acidosis on tension and [Ca2+]i in rat cerebral arteries: is there a role for membrane potential?  
AB  - The cellular mechanism responsible for the reduction of tension in cerebral small arteries to acidosis is not known. In this study the role of smooth muscle intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and membrane potential for the relaxation to acidosis was investigated in isolated rat cerebral small arteries. Isometric force was measured simultaneously with [Ca2+]i (fura 2) or with membrane potential (intracellular microelectrodes), and acidosis was induced by increasing PCO2 or reducing HCO3- of the bathing solution. Both hypercapnic and normocapnic acidosis were associated with a reduction of intracellular pH [measured with 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5 (and -6)-carboxyfluorescein], caused relaxation, and reduced [Ca2+]i. However, whereas hypercapnic acidosis caused hyperpolarization, normocapnic acidosis was associated with depolarization. It is concluded that a reduction of [Ca2+]i is in part responsible for the direct effect of the acidosis on the vascular smooth muscle both during normo- and hypercapnia. The mechanism responsible for the reduction of [Ca2+]i differs between the hypercapnic and normocapnic acidosis, being partly explained by hyperpolarization during hypercapnic acidosis, whereas it is seen despite depolarization during normocapnic acidosis.

TI  - Regulation of blood volume during training in post-menopausal women.  
AB  - In younger people the increase in aerobic capacity following training is related, in part, to blood volume (BV) expansion and the consequent improvements in maximal cardiac output. This training-induced hypervolemia is associated with a decrease in cardiopulmonary baroreflex (CPBR) control of peripheral vascular tone. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) during training in older women is associated with specific central adaptations, such as BV expansion and a reduction in CPBR control of vascular tone. METHODS: Seventeen healthy older women were randomized into training (N = 9, 71 +/- 2 yr) and control (N = 8, 73 +/- 3 yr) groups. The training group exercised three to four times per wk for 30 min at 60% peak heart rate for 12 wk and then 40-50 min at 75% peak heart rate for 12 wk. The control group participated in yoga exercises over the same time period. We measured resting BV (Evans blue dye), VO2peak, and the forearm vascular resistance response to unloading low pressure mechanoreceptors during low levels of lower body negative pressure (through -20 mm Hg) before and after aerobic training. The slope of the increase in forearm vascular resistance (response) per unit decrease in central venous pressure (stimulus) was used to assess CPBR responsiveness. RESULTS: Aerobic training increased VO2peak 14.2% from 24.2 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) to 27.7 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.05), a smaller improvement than typically seen in younger subjects. Blood volume (59.9 +/- 1.9 and 60.9 +/- 1.9 mL x kg[-1]) and CPBR function (-3.98 +/- 0.92 and -3.46 +/- 0.94 units x mm(-1) Hg) were similar before and after training. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the inability to induce adaptations in CPBR function may limit BV expansion during training in older women. In addition, the absence of these specific adaptations may contribute to the relatively poor improvements in VO2peak in older women during short (10-12 wk) periods of training.

TI  - Lectin-like activity of Escherichia coli K88, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Bifidobacteria pseudolongum of porcine gastrointestinal origin.  
AB  - The lectin-like activity of Escherichia coli K88, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Bifidobacteria pseudolongum of porcine gastrointestinal origin was studied by hemagglutination (HA) and HA inhibition assays. Although all the bacterial strains were able to agglutinate Porcine and Lagomorpna erythrocytes, much higher HA titers were consistently observed for B. pseudolongum than for E. coli K88 or S. choleraesuis. Proteinaceous components and glycoproteins were responsible for the HA of E. coli K88 and B. pseudolongum, respectively, because a remarkable reduction of HA titers occurred due to treatment of E. coli K88 with protease or trypsin and of B. pseudolongum with protease and periodate. Hemagglutination of E. coli K88, S. choleraesuis, and B. pseudolongum was strongly inhibited by galactosyl residue-containing glycoproteins, including porcine and bovine mucin, thyroglobulin, and fetuin. Some sugars, including lactose, galactose, xylose, and xylooligosaccharide (XOS), at a relatively high concentration (47 to 92 mg/mL) also exhibited an inhibitory activity for the HA of B. pseudolongum. This result, combined with the enhanced HA activity of the three bacterial strains by modification of Lagomorpna erythrocytes with neuraminidase, indicated that galactosyl residue-containing glycoproteins mediated the HA of E. coli K88, S. choleraesuis, and B. pseudolongum. Our study demonstrated that proteinaceous or glycoproteinaceous lectin-like substances that recognize galactosyl residue-containing molecules, especially intestinal mucin, exist on the surface of E. coli K88, S. choleraesuis, and B. pseudolongum.

TI  - The effect of melatonin chronic treatment upon macrophage and lymphocyte metabolism and function in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.  
AB  - Melatonin is the main hormone involved in the neuroendocrine-immune axis. It also presents antitumour activity. To evaluate the role of melatonin on the progression of Walker-256 tumour in rats we determined the effect of the hormone on some biochemical and functional aspects of macrophage and lymphocytes from cachectic rats. An important finding observed in immune cells from tumour-bearing (TB) rats is the impairment on glutamine and glucose metabolism in such cells. These changes are very similar to those observed in pinealectomized rats (PNX). The increased production of lactate and the flux of glucose through the Krebs cycle and the reduction in glutamine consumption seems to be involved in the immunosuppression presented in the TB and PNX animals. Melatonin treatment restored the changes observed in the metabolism of glucose and glutamine and stimulated the proliferation of lymphocytes from tumour-bearing rats. The results indicate that the effect of melatonin upon tumour growth involves the stimulation of the immune system by the hormone.

AB  - The effects of chronic diazepam (D) treatment and exercise training on total body mass (TBM), microsomal protein yield (MPY), calcium uptake by fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), muscle fibre cross-sectional area, and both PFK and SDH activities were investigated in the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (Sol), and plantaris (Plt) muscles of 50 male albino Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were assigned randomly to control (C), sprint-trained (S), or endurance-trained (E) groups. Training was of 12 weeks duration. One-half of each group received daily intraperitoneally D doses of 5 mg kg-1 of TBM. Exercise reduced TBM (p < 0.05); increased the relative BM of the TA (E = 2.02 +/- 0.02, p < 0.01) and Plt (E = 1.15 +/- 0.02, p < 0.01; S = 1.13 +/- 0.03, p < 0.01), as well as the Ca++ uptake of the Sol SR (C = 0.08 +/- 0.02, E = 0.16 +/- 01, p < 0.05). MPY was elevated in S-Sol (C = 1.12 +/- 0.6, S = 1.52 +/- 0.1, p < 0.01). D elevated Sol MPY as well as TA PFK. S-trained animals had lower mean fibre areas than the E-trained (D-treated and untreated) animals. The elevated relative masses of TA and Plt are explained by a decreased TBM with exercise. The increased Ca++ uptake of the Sol indicates that E enhances this function, and the increased MPY probably implies an increased SR. The D could be responsible for the D-elevated Sol MPY as well as the TA PFK. El D did not reduce neuromuscular activity to a level adversely affecting oxidative enzyme activity, but in the case of PFK activity in the TA muscle, such a reduction was evident.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory/analgesic effects of lornoxicam in the carrageenan model of inflammatory nociception. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hours after intraplantar carrageenan (6 mg/150 microl of saline), we assessed the effects of pre-administered lornoxicam (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 9 mg/kg i.v., n=10 rats for each group) on both the peripheral oedema and number of c-Fos-protein-like immunoreactive (c-Fos-LI) neurons in the lumbar L4-L5 segments, in the awake rat. RESULTS: Lornoxicam dose-relatedly reduced both the carrageenan evoked oedema (r=0.63 and r=0.53 for paw and ankle diameter respectively; p<0.001 for both) and total number of spinal c-Fos-LI neurons (r=0.79; p<0.001), with the strongest effect corresponding to a 75 +/- 2% reduction of the number of c-Fos-LI neurons (p<0.001) for the highest dose (9 mg/kg), and a 45 +/- 3% reduction (p<0.001) for the low dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Reductions of both the peripheral oedema and spinal c-Fos expression were correlated (r=0.74 and r=0.57 for the paw and ankle diameter respectively; p<0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that lornoxicam reduces in parallel both the carrageenan-evoked oedema and spinal c-Fos expression, with clear evidence for a potent effect of low doses of lornoxicam. Correlated reductions in c-Fos expression and paw oedema suggest a predominantly peripheral site of action of lornoxicam.

TI  - Drought-induced responses in plant cells.  
AB  - Plants subjected to water stress undergo numerous physiological and metabolic changes. A general decrease in photosynthetic rate is among the most common responses. This is due to a programmed process involving the closure of stomata and reduction in the activity of photosynthetic enzymes. The plant hormone abscisic acid plays an important role in this process. Accumulation of compatible solutes, during water stress, is thought to be an adaptive response which has been developed by some plant species. Engineering the genes involved in the synthesis of these compounds, into nonaccumulating plants, has demonstrated promising results for genetic improvement of drought tolerance. Drought stress induces alteration of gene expression. A large number of genes which are upregulated by water stress have been isolated and characterized. Proteins encoded by some of these genes share several characteristics. The biochemical role of most of these gene products is unknown, but potential adaptive functions have been suggested. Abscisic acid is involved in the regulation of some of these genes.

AB  - The safety and efficacy of an interdental cleaning device (Braun Oral-B Interclean--ID2) used with a Flexi-Tip gingival massage attachment were evaluated in an investigator-blind comparison with manual floss. Over a 4-week period, 59 healthy volunteers were studied with respect to whole-mouth and interproximal plaque accumulation, gingival index and gingival bleeding. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups following a complete dental examination on Day 1. Subjects each underwent a dental prophylaxis before receiving flossing or massaging instructions. Plaque, gingivitis and gingival bleeding index scores were evaluated at Day 1 and Week 4. There was a significant reduction from baseline in all three parameters (whole-mouth and interproximal) in each of the groups, over the 4-week period. Reductions for whole-mouth and interproximal plaque scores were 20.3% and 17.0%, respectively in the ID2 group, compared with 16.2% and 13.8%, respectively in the manual floss group. Reductions for gingivitis were 13.0% and 14.1% in the ID2 group, compared with 14.0% and 16.2% in the manual floss group, and for gingival bleeding 52.2% and 53.6% in the ID2 group, compared with 51.7% and 55.6% in the manual floss group, respectively. Differences between treatment groups for each study parameter were not statistically significant. There was no significant soft tissue pathology noted in either study group. The results demonstrated that the manual floss and the interdental cleaning device, when used with the gingival massage attachment, were equally effective.

TI  - Effects of enterostatin on consumption of optional foods in non-food-deprived rats.  
AB  - Enterostatin, the activation peptide of procolipase, has been reported to reduce high-fat food consumption in rats.  This reduction has been reliably demonstrated using procedures in which the test diet was also the maintenance diet of the animals. Other reports, though, have shown that peripherally administered enterostatin had no effect on the consumption of oil provided as an option to the diet, and that centrally administered enterostatin had no effect on the consumption of an optional high-fat mixed food. However, the effects of peripherally administered enterostatin on the consumption of an optional high-fat mixed food have not been examined. This experiment, then, examined the effects of peripherally administered enterostatin on the consumption of optional, mixed foods (no-fat and high-fat cookies) provided in addition to a standard diet under choice and nonchoice conditions. Four experiments were conducted. In experiment I, the effect of enterostatin in a two-choice feeding paradigm was assessed. In experiment II, the effect of enterostatin in a nonchoice feeding paradigm was assessed. In experiment III, the effect of enterostatin administered at five different pretreatment times in a non-choice feeding paradigm was assessed. Enterostatin had no effect on cookie intake in any of these experiments. Finally, experiment IV was undertaken to verify the activity of the peptide. Enterostatin significantly reduced the consumption of a standard diet in overnight food-deprived rats, thus confirming the activity of the peptide used in experiments I to III. Enterostatin may not play a major role in the regulation of food intake that is stimulated by optional foods that are periodically provided in addition to a standard well-balanced diet.

TI  - Reduced intravascular catheter-related infection by routine use of antibiotic-bonded catheters in a surgical intensive care unit.  
AB  - We report a comparative analysis of intravascular catheter-related infection before and after routine use of antibiotic-bonded catheters in an intensive care unit. Cefazolin-bonded catheters were placed in patients requiring catheterization for at least 3 days, or with remote infection, standard catheters at other times. One thousand forty-five catheters (259 patients) over 6 months were compared with 801 (236 antibiotic-bonded, 565 standard) catheters (239 patients) the next 6 months. After use of antibiotic-bonded catheters, we found: 1.7% catheters infected versus 3.7% (p = 0.01); catheter-associated bacteremia 0.1% versus 1.3% (p < 0.005); catheter-related infection rate 4.39 versus 10.73 per 1000 patient days (p < 0.005), and 5.06 versus 11.47 per 1000 catheter days (p < 0.01); and cumulative risk of infection decreased (p < 0.005). Antibiotic-bonded catheters were used with more remote infections (52% versus 27%, p < 0.001), had longer indwelling time (4.4 versus 3.1 days, p = 0.0001), and more were inserted over a guide wire (66% vs. 28%, p < 0.001). In conclusion routine use of antibiotic-bonded catheters was associated with a significant reduction in infectious complications.

TI  - A descriptive report of the effects of a 16-month xylitol chewing-gum programme subsequent to a 40-month sucrose gum programme.  
AB  - A previous caries trial (Belize studies) involved the usage of sucrose chewing-gum for a period of 40 months in one group of initially 10-year-old subjects in an environment of high sugar consumption, high caries activity, and limited access to restorative care. After the termination of the 40-month supervised sucrose gum usage, the 109 subjects of the original sucrose group retrieved at the endpoint of the original trial were invited to participate in a xylitol chewing-gum programme (involving the usage of the '100% pellet-shaped formular') for 16 months. The average daily consumption level of xylitol was up to 14 g per subject, normally used in seven daily chewing episodes. Although most subjects used chewing-gum at schools and received their gum portions from a school official, gum chewing during these 16 months was mostly unsupervised. After 16 months, 83 subjects (76%; mean age 14.9 years) were retrieved. The caries status of these subjects was examined by the same calibrated, blinded examiners as in the original trial. To mask the examiners, 141 similar non-participating subjects were recruited from the same school classes and were examined in a random order with the gum-using subjects, according to the same standard routine. The intensified xylitol gum usage for 16 months was associated with a reduction of the mean DMFS score from 10.9 (at 40 months) to 9.3 (at 56 months, p = 0.0013) and a reduction in caries rate from 20.1 caries onsets per 1,000 surface-years (40-month period average rate) to 10.2 caries onsets per 1,000 surface-years. The reduction in DMFS score resulted mostly from the change in the D component of the index and possibly reflected a stabilisation of the caries process and rehardening of some caries lesions to a non-progressive carious state.

TI  - Left ventricular hypertrophy: how to influence an important risk factor in hypertension.  
AB  - LVH AND RISK: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent from blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. Available data indicate that patients who fail to achieve a reduction in LVH are much more likely to suffer cardiovascular events than those in whom LVH is reduced or even normalized using antihypertensive treatment. Reversal of LVH, therefore, represents a major goal in the treatment of hypertensive patients. REGRESSION OF LVH: Since obesity and dietary sodium intake may modulate the degree of LVH, non-pharmacological intervention has achieved a successful reduction in left ventricular mass (LVM). LVM is more closely related to 24-h blood pressure values than to clinical blood pressure values. Recent evidence from the Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation has shown that the regression of cardiac hypertrophy is predicted to a greater degree by the effect of antihypertensive treatment on 24-h average blood pressure than by that on clinic or home blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure variability may also be an independent determinant of cardiovascular target-organ damage, particularly of cardiac hypertrophy. However, the effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure variability can be difficult to determine, mainly because a correct measurement of variability requires a beat-to-beat measurement of ambulatory blood pressure; several measures have been proposed to evaluate the smoothness of blood pressure control during antihypertensive treatment. Other important determinants of LVH reduction are represented by baseline values of LVM, extent of blood pressure reduction and duration of treatment. Furthermore, the degree of cardiac hypertrophy reduction is not the same for the different classes of antihypertensive drugs because, beyond the control of blood pressure, they may interfere differently with several non-haemodynamic stimuli, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and the adrenergic systems or other growth factors. A more pronounced reduction in LVM with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists has been demonstrated in several recent meta-analyses. The results of further multicenter on-going trials are awaited to evaluate definitely whether various antihypertensive strategies differ in their ability to reverse LVH and to adequately assess the relationship between changes in LVM and subsequent prognosis, with serial control of blood pressure values measured in the clinic and by ambulatory monitoring.

The formed cavity is filled by two autografts, bone bits, antibiotics and hemostatic sponge. The two autografts are formed as a cross and their ends are clung to the edge of the entrance aperture of the bone. Stitches are placed to the periosteum and the strata of the abdominal wall.

TI  - Inhibition of RNA synthesis as a therapeutic strategy against Aspergillus and Fusarium: demonstration of in vitro synergy between rifabutin and amphotericin B.  
AB  - We investigated the in vitro antifungal activity of amphotericin B, alone and in combination with rifabutin, an inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase, against 26 clinical isolates of Aspergillus and 25 clinical isolates of Fusarium. Synergy or additivism between these drugs was demonstrated against all isolates tested. Amphotericin B MICs were reduced upon combination with rifabutin from a mean of 0.65 microg/ml to a mean of 0.16 microg/ml against Aspergillus, and from a mean of 0.97 microg/ml to a mean of 0.39 microLg/ml against Fusarium (P < 0.000001 for both). Similarly, the MICs of rifabutin were reduced upon combination with amphotericin B from a mean of >32 microg/ml to a mean of 1.1 microg/ml against both fungi (P < 0.000001 for both). These positive interactions were corroborated by a colony count study with two Fusarium isolates, for which treatment with the combination of subinhibitory concentrations of amphotericin B (at concentrations 2- and 4-fold less than the MIC) and rifabutin (at concentrations ranging from 4- to 64-fold less than the MIC) resulted in 3.2-log reductions in colony counts compared to those after treatment with either drug alone. Inhibition of RNA synthesis was shown to be the mechanism of antifungal activity. These results suggest that inhibition of fungal RNA synthesis might be a potential target for antifungal therapy.

TI  - Effects of smoking on testicular function and fertilizing potential in rats.  
AB  - We evaluated the effects of smoking on testicular function and fertilizing potential in rats. Twenty rats (group A) were exposed to the smoke of 20 cigarettes for 1 h per day. Ten rats (group B) were exposed to the smoke of 40 incense sticks for 1 h per day, and an additional 10 rats served as a control group (group C). After 10 weeks of daily exposure, serum levels of nicotine and cotinine were assessed, and a mating test was conducted. Five days later, serum concentrations of testosterone before and after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation, gonadotropins, and epididymal sperm content and motility were evaluated. In addition, in vitro fertilization was carried out. Nicotine and cotinine were detected in group A, but not in groups B and C. Basal serum testosterone and gonadotropin concentrations did not differ significantly among the three groups, but the testosterone response to hCG stimulation was significantly lower in group A than in groups B and C. Group A showed significant reductions in epididymal sperm content and motility, and in fertility in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that smoking leads to a secretory dysfunction of the Leydig cells, and also a deficiency in sperm maturation and spermatogenesis. In addition, smoking has a detrimental effect on sperm fertilizing potentials in vivo and in vitro.

TI  - Relation of heart rate variability and serum lipoproteins in type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic stable angina pectoris.  
AB  - This investigation examines whether serum lipoprotein levels in patients with diabetes mellitus and in those with coronary artery disease are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV). The study group consisted of 58 subjects divided into 3 groups: normal subjects, chronic stable angina, and type 1 diabetes. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings were analyzed in the time and frequency domains; standard instantaneous autonomic testing was also performed. On 24-hour ambulatory recordings, patients with chronic stable angina had significantly lower HRV than normals, and diabetics had a more marked reduction in HRV than both normals and anginal patients. When anginal patients and diabetics were stratified by total serum and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, diabetics with elevated total and LDL cholesterol had an additional, significant decrease in HRV parameters. No such difference was demonstrated in patients with stable angina. No significant correlations were noted for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or total cholesterol/HDL ratio and HRV in diabetics or patient with angina. Diabetics with markedly abnormal peripheral reflexes had significantly higher triglycerides and total cholesterol/HDL ratios. Finally, standard tests of autonomic function did not correlate with total, LDL, HDL cholesterol levels, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, or triglycerides. Thus, we found a relation between atherogenic lipid levels and reduced HRV in diabetic patients that has not been previously identified.

TI  - Effects of partial liquid ventilation on lung injury in a model of acute respiratory failure: a histologic and morphometric analysis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the histopathologic changes observed in a sheep model of oleic acid-induced acute respiratory failure during partial liquid ventilation with perflubron with gas ventilation. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Animal laboratory and pathology laboratories of a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Fourteen healthy adult sheep, weighing 64.9 +/- 6.4 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced with oleic acid (0.15 mL/kg). A tracheostomy tube was inserted, along with systemic and pulmonary artery monitoring catheters. Animals were randomized to undergo either partial liquid ventilation (n = 7) or gas ventilation (n = 7). Animals underwent euthanasia at the end of the 90-min study period, after which the endotracheal tube was clamped with the lungs in expiratory hold at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O. En bloc excision of the heart and lungs was performed by thoracotomy. Perfusion of the isolated lung vasculature with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1-M phosphate buffer was performed. Histologic analysis followed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gas exchange increased markedly in the animals that underwent partial liquid ventilation compared with the gas-ventilated animals (PaO2 at 90 mins: gas ventilation-treatment group, 40 +/- 8 torr [5.3 +/- 1.1 kPa]; partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 108 +/- 60 torr [14.4 +/- 8.0 kPa]; p = .004). Lung histologic analysis demonstrated a better overall diffuse alveolar damage score (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 12.4 +/- 1.4; gas ventilation-treatment group, 15.0 +/- 1.7; p = .01). In the partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, we observed an increase in mean alveolar diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 82.4 +/- 2.9 microm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 67.7 x 3.9 microm; p = .0022) and a decrease in the number of alveoli per high-power field (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 25.7 +/- 0.9, gas ventilation-treatment group, 31.4 +/- 2.5; p = .0022), in septal wall thickness (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 6.0 +/- 0.6 microm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 8.3 +/- 1.0 microm; p = .0033), and in mean capillary diameter (partial liquid ventilation-treatment group, 13.0 +/- 0.8 microm; gas ventilation-treatment group, 19.9 +/- 1.4 microm; p = .0022). CONCLUSIONS: Partial liquid ventilation is associated with notable improvement in gas exchange and with a reduction in the histologic and morphologic changes observed in an oleic acid model of acute lung injury.

TI  - Depression of synaptic efficacy at intermolt in crayfish neuromuscular junctions by 20-hydroxyecdysone, a molting hormone.  
AB  - This report demonstrates that ecdysteroids can reduce synaptic transmission at an intermolt stage of a crustacean tonic neuromuscular junction by acting at a presynaptic site. The steroid molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE), appears to act through a rapid, nongenomic mechanism that decreases the probability of synaptic vesicle release and reduces the number of release sites. Quantal analysis revealed that fewer vesicles were released for a given stimulus when 20-HE was present, and this in turn accounted for the reduced synaptic efficacy. Reduced synaptic efficacy produced smaller evoked postsynaptic currents and smaller excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) across the muscle fiber membrane.  The reduction in EPSPs was observed among muscle fibers that were innervated by high- or low-output terminals. The behavior of crustaceans/crayfish during the molt cycle, when 20-HE is high, may be explained by the reduction in synaptic transmission. Crustaceans become quiescent during the premolt periods as do insects. The effects of 20-HE can be reversed with the application of the crustacean neuromodulator serotonin, which enhances synaptic transmission.

TI  - 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits tenascin-C expression in mammary epithelial cells.  
AB  - Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix protein with growth-, invasion- and angiogenesis-promoting activities. Tenascin-C is upregulated in breast carcinoma and stromal cells, and in many other cell types during tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that tenascin-C RNA expression is inhibited by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) in a variety of mouse and human mammary epithelial cell lines exhibiting normal or malignant phenotype. In EpH4 cells, the inhibition is maximum 24 h after 1,25-D3 treatment and correlates with a dose-dependent reduction in the synthesis of tenascin-C protein. Furthermore, 1,25-D3 also abolishes the induction of tenascin-C by serum or the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. The inhibition of tenascin-C expression may be relevant for the anticancer activity of 1,25-D3.

TI  - [Factors that determine intensity of response to treatment with tiludronate in Paget's disease]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of both clinical and pharmacokinetic factors as determinants of response to tiludronate in Paget's bone disease (PBD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty six PBD patients with serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels at least twice the normal upper limit were enrolled. The sample included 17 (65%) men and 9 (35%) women whose mean age (SD) was 60.3 (9.8) (range: 38-76). Each patient received 400 mg/day of tiludronate, per os, for 90 (6) days. The SAP variations were considered as the main parameter of response. Plasma concentrations of tiludronate were assayed using the HPLC method with UV detection; the maximum and minimum (Cmin) concentration, as well as the area under a concentration-time curve were calculated. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess the influence on tiludronate effect. RESULTS: Mean (SD) percent reduction of SAP from the initial values ranged from 30.5 (13.9) at the end of the first month of drug intake to a nadir of 76.1 (8.8) achieved 6 months after the treatment was stopped. Serum SAP activity fell to normal range in 7 (27%) patients at the end of the therapy period, in 17 (65%) three months later, and in 18 (69%) one year thereafter. One year after the treatment ended only one patient had evidence of relapse. Final multivariate regression model showed that the percent reduction of SAP increases by 11.9 percent points per Cmin tiludronate unit and by 0.006 points per basal SAP unit, and decreases by 0.52 per year of age. Out of 13 patients with bone pain, 9 (69%) experienced relief within the second and third months of treatment. No clinical or laboratory severe side effects were seen and only five patients (19%) had mild adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that tiludronate leads to a marked suppression of PDB clinical and biochemical activity. Cmin of tiludronate in plasma is the best predictor of biochemical response.

TI  - The metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline affects Schistosoma mansoni motor activity, egg laying and viability.  
AB  - The Zn(2+)-chelating metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline (phenanthroline, 5-150 microM) elicited dose-dependent contraction of the longitudinal and circular (transverse) musculature of adult male schistosomes. At the same concentrations, phenanthroline did not cause contraction of dispersed individual muscle fibres. The phenanthroline-induced contractions were reduced by the inclusion of 100 or 300 microM Zn2+ in the extracellular medium. Phenanthroline (0.5-150 microM) also inhibited the egg production of adult worm pairs in vitro, with a 98% reduction at 50 microM. When worm pairs were exposed to phenanthroline, the males detached from the dish and released the females, resulting in unpaired worms. At the higher concentrations (50 and 150 microM), the worms were killed in vitro. Worm burdens were reduced by over 50% in infected mice injected with phenanthroline (20 mg/kg/day for 4 days), but twice the dose resulted in only a 25% reduction. Phenanthroline injections also induced an hepatic shift and an unpairing of adult worms in infected mice, and the female worms appeared degenerate and lacked gut pigmentation. Mice fed a diet containing 0.3% phenanthroline received significant protection from infection when challenged with schistosome cercaria, where phenanthroline-fed mice had 94% fewer adult worms than control mice. The broad range of phenanthroline effects on schistosomes suggests broad and important functions for metalloproteases in these worms.

TI  - The in vivo relationship between blood flow, contractions, pH and metabolites in the rat uterus.  
AB  - Little is known about the relationship between smooth muscle contractile activity and its blood supply. We have therefore investigated this in the rat uterus, using laser-Doppler flow measurement and intra-uterine pressure recordings. We found an inverse linear relationship between flow and contractile activity. There was no evidence for a critical level of flow, above which function is maintained and below which it declines; even small reductions in blood flow decreased uterine force. Force was rapidly restored upon reperfusion. Reactive hyperaemia was absent from all but 6 of the 41 preparations studied. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and intracellular pH (pHi) simultaneously with force and flow. Reductions in flow were associated with significant reductions in [ATP], [PCr] and pHi, and an increase in [Pi]. These changes were related to flow significantly and linearly and their effects on force may be additive. These data show that uterine smooth muscle is closely dependent upon its blood supply for maintaining both normal force production and metabolite levels. Consequently, even small decrements in flow may have deleterious functional effects.

TI  - Dopamine-D2 actions on voltage-dependent calcium current and gonadotropin-II secretion in cultured goldfish gonadotrophs.  
AB  - Dopamine D2-receptor activation directly inhibits GnRH-induced gonadotropin-II (maturational gonadotropin, GTH-II) secretion from goldfish pituitary cells. In this study, we show that dopamine and its D2 agonist, quinpirole, reduced GTH-II secretion induced by either high extracellular K+ concentration or the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644. These actions of dopamine were blocked by addition of the dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, spiperone. The actions of dopamine on Ca2+ current in single identified goldfish gonadotrophs were assessed in voltage-clamp experiments using Ba2+ as the charge carrier through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Dopamine caused a concentration-dependent reduction in Ba2+ current amplitude with an EC50 of 1.0+/-0.3 nM, but did not shift the current-voltage relationship. The D2 agonist quinpirole also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the Ba2+ current amplitude with an EC50 of 2.7+/-1.4 nM. Quinpirole slowed the activation and inactivation kinetics, as well as removing the steady-state inactivation properties of the Ba2+ current. In contrast to the actions of quinpirole, the dopamine D1-receptor agonist, SKF 38393, did not affect the Ba2+ current. The inhibitory action of dopamine on voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents was reversed by spiperone, but not by the D1 antagonist SKF 83566. Voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ currents were not affected by dopamine or dopamine agonists. These data indicate that dopamine D2-receptor activation reduces Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to inhibit GTH-II secretion.

TI  - An empiric evaluation of the Institute of Medicine's pregnancy weight gain guidelines by race.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between pregnancy weight gain outside and within ranges recommended by the Institute of Medicine and birth weight by both prepregnant body mass index (BMI) and race-ethnicity. METHODS: Mean birth weight and incidence of term low birth weight (LBW, less than 2500 g) and high birth weight (more than 4500 g) were compared across BMI-pregnancy weight gain-race-ethnicity strata. Subjects were 173,066 white, black, and Hispanic low-income pregnant women attending prenatal nutrition programs between 1990 and 1993. RESULTS: Among low and average BMI women (all race-ethnicity groups), weight gain within Institute of Medicine ranges resulted in significant LBW reductions; further LBW reductions at gains beyond Institute of Medicine ranges were offset by increasing high birth weight risk. Among women of high and obese BMI, LBW trends were less pronounced; thus, the benefit of gaining within the Institute of Medicine range was less apparent. Although blacks in every BMI-weight gain category had lower mean birth weights than white women, gaining in the upper end of the Institute of Medicine ranges did not provide a consistent LBW reduction for black women; adjusted LBW odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for gains in the upper relative to the lower half of the Institute of Medicine range were 1.3 (0.8, 2.1), 0.7 (0.5, 1.03), 0.3 (0.2, 0.8), and 1.3 (0.7, 2.5) for black women of low, average, high, and obese BMI, respectively. CONCLUSION: Institute of Medicine pregnancy weight gain ranges recommended for low and average BMI women appear reasonable, but recommendations for high and obese BMI women require further evaluation. The recommendation that black women in all BMI groups strive for gains toward the upper ends of the ranges is not supported clearly by these data.

TI  - Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and reduced risk of large bowel carcinoma.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal experiments and epidemiologic data have suggested that the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the incidence of large bowel carcinoma. Our purpose was to assess the relation of the use of aspirin and nonaspirin NSAIDs with the risk of large bowel carcinoma. METHODS: A population-based case-control study of colon and rectal carcinoma was conducted in Massachusetts from 1992 to 1994. Data on NSAID use and risk factors for large bowel carcinoma were collected by interview from 1201 incident cases of large bowel carcinoma and 1201 controls matched by age, gender, and area of residence. RESULTS: Regular NSAID use that continued into the year before diagnosis was associated with a significantly decreased relative risk estimate overall (0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.8) and among Stage II-IV tumors (0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7). There was no reduction in risk for discontinued use. The inverse association with regular continuing use was present across age and gender and for both colon and rectal carcinoma. Similar inverse associations were present for regular continuing use of aspirin and nonaspirin NSAIDs. There was no significant evidence of a trend for the relative risk to decrease as the duration of use increased, nor was there a trend across the dose of aspirin, which ranged from less than one-half of a 325 mg tablet per day to > or = 2 tablets per day. Discontinuation of use in response to symptoms of carcinoma did not appear to explain the inverse association, nor did bias related to diagnosis of the carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: These data add to the growing body of evidence that suggests a protective effect of NSAIDs against large bowel carcinoma.

TI  - Preferential allelic expression can lead to reduced expression of BRCA1 in sporadic breast cancers.  
AB  - BRCA1 is considered to be a tumor-suppressor gene, yet mutations in this gene are uncommon in sporadic breast tumors. We investigated whether mechanisms other than DNA mutations that affect the coding region might be involved in breast carcinogenesis. Since loss of expression of the BRCA1 gene would lead to lack of protein, we evaluated the level of BRCA1 mRNA in 21 normal epithelial specimens and in 74 breast carcinomas using quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). All normal breast epithelial samples expressed BRCA1 mRNA. On the other hand, the tumor specimens exhibited approximately 10-fold range of levels of BRCA1, with some specimens expressing barely detectable amounts of BRCA1 mRNA. The distribution in levels was significantly higher in normal breast epithelial cells than in tumor specimens (p = 0.004). Examination of the BRCA1 locus indicated that deletion of the BRCA1 gene may account for low levels of BRCA1 in a number of specimens. In addition, analysis of samples with relatively reduced levels of BRCA1 expression revealed preferential allele-specific expression in a number of cases, suggesting the presence of regulatory mutations. Our data suggest that the BRCA1 gene may be involved in sporadic breast carcinogenesis through a reduction in gene expression.

AB  - The rate of particle clearance from the gills was assessed in healthy rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), challenged with the formalin-killed bacterium Flavobacterium branchiophilum, as well as in fish with altered ventilation levels produced by varying the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water. The clearance of F. branchiophilum from the gills was quantified by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fish held under normoxic conditions (DO = 9.5 mg/l) showed an initial rapid reduction in bacterial antigen, with 50% of the bacteria being cleared in the first 12 h after exposure, followed by slower clearance for the remaining bacteria; total elimination was achieved by 40 h. Fish with reduced ventilation rates (hyperoxia; DO = 25 mg/l) and elevated ventilation rates (hypoxia; DO = 4.5 mg/l) had significantly impaired particle clearance (r < 0.05), achieving only 60 and 20% reduction, respectively, at 72 h after challenge.

TI  - Action of Al-ATP on the isolated working rat heart.  
AB  - ATP is an important extracellular messenger in the coronary vasculature of the heart. To be effective its extracellular concentration must be tightly controlled and this is achieved via ectonucleotidases located in the luminal surface of the coronary endothelium. Al-ATP is a potent inhibitor of the hydrolysis of ATP and we speculated that Al-ATP released by cells into the blood would disrupt the signalling function of extracellular ATP. We tested this hypothesis by perfusing isolated working Wistar rat hearts with buffers containing either ATP or Al-ATP. The functional parameters measured were, coronary flow, heart rate and pulsatile power. A number of control perfusions including adenosine, ATP-gamma-S and Al were used to identify those effects which might be specific to ATP and Al-ATP. Al-ATP did not appear to inhibit the function of the endothelial ectonucleotidases. Both ATP and Al-ATP produced a significant increase in coronary flow and this could be attributed to a coronary vasodilation. Interestingly, whilst the effect of ATP was reversible that of Al-ATP was not. ATP caused a reduction in heart rate which was potentiated by aluminium. The negatively chronotropic effect of Al-ATP was mediated via a mechanism which was either distinct from or in addition to the similar response known to be caused by adenosine. We have demonstrated for the first time an influence of Al-ATP on heart function. Perhaps more pertinently we present the first evidence that Al-ATP may influence the function of ATP-specific receptors.

TI  - Local cerebral blood flow autoregulation following "asymptomatic" cerebral venous occlusion in the rat.  
AB  - OBJECT: Maintenance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation in the brain is of major importance for patient outcome in various clinical conditions. The authors assessed local autoregulation after "asymptomatic" cortical vein occlusion. METHODS: In Wistar rats, a single cortical vein was occluded photochemically by using rose bengal and fiberoptic illumination. In rats with bilateral carotid artery occlusion, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was lowered in 5-mm Hg increments down to 40 mm Hg by using hypobaric hypotension. Local CBF at each pressure level was assessed by performing laser Doppler (LD) scanning at 25 (5 x 5) locations within bilateral cranial windows. In this manner, the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) was detected. The LLA was 60 mm Hg in both right and left hemispheres in Group A (five rats), in which the animals received illumination without rose bengal and had no venous occlusion. Of the 11 rats that underwent vein occlusion, three developed severe reductions in local CBF and/or a growing venous thrombus and were distinguished as Group C (symptomatic; three rats); from previous work we know that those animals are bound to experience venous infarction. The remaining rats formed Group B (asymptomatic; eight rats). In this group the LLA remained at 60 mm Hg in the left hemisphere without occlusion, whereas, in the right cortex with the occluded vein, the LLA was found to be 65 mm Hg. Below a carotid stump pressure of 25 mm Hg regional CBF in the affected hemisphere dropped more abruptly to a possibly ischemic range than that in the opposite normal hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that cerebral venous circulation disorders are manifested via additional pathways, that is, from a partially impaired local autoregulation in the vicinity of the occluded vein, even under conditions in which the vein occlusion itself does not cause brain damage. Care should be taken in the control of blood pressure in patients with this pathological condition.

TI  - Food restriction attenuates the blood pressure response to paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei lesions in aortic coarctation hypertension.  
AB  - Chronic food restriction reduces blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic support of BP in aortic coarctation hypertension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic food restriction would reduce sympathetic support of BP mediated by the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN). Hypertension was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=40) by suprarenal aortic coarctation. Rats were assigned to either an ad libitum fed (AL) group or a food restricted (FR) group that received 60% of the food consumed by AL for 3 weeks. One week prior to data collection, catheters were implanted in the left carotid artery and right jugular vein. BP was measured for 2 days prior to, and 7 days after rats in AL and FR groups received either bilateral electrolytic lesions of the PVN (PVNx) or sham lesions (SHAM). Prior to either PVNx or SHAM, FR rats had significantly lower BP (AL=152+/-5; FR=113+/-2 mmHg), less of a depressor response to ganglionic blockade (AL=-58+/-4; FR=-35+/-2 mmHg), and lower plasma norepinephrine levels (AL=758+/-71; FR=380+/-23 pg/ml) compared to AL. PVNx reduced BP in both AL and FR rats (AL-PVNx=105+/-6 mmHg, FR-PVNx=101+/-3 mmHg). PVNx also lowered the depressor response to ganglionic blockade (AL-PVNx=-28+/-5 mmHg, FR-PVNx=-29+/-4 mmHg) and plasma norepinephrine levels (AL-PVNx=372+/-74 pg/ml, FR-PVNx=248+/-31 pg/ml). FR decreased the magnitude of the reductions in resting BP and in sympathetic activity in response to PVNx. These results indicate that intact PVN are required for maintenance of aortic coarctation hypertension, and implicate the PVN as a site involved in BP reductions produced by chronic food restriction.

TI  - Involvement of products of the nrfEFG genes in the covalent attachment of haem c to a novel cysteine-lysine motif in the cytochrome c552 nitrite reductase from Escherichia coli.  
AB  - Cytochrome c552 is the terminal component of the formate-dependent nitrite reduction pathway of Escherichia coli. In addition to four 'typical' haem-binding motifs, CXXCH-, characteristic of c-type cytochromes, the N-terminal region of NrfA includes a motif, CWSCK. Peptides generated by digesting the cytochrome from wild-type bacteria with cyanogen bromide followed by trypsin were analysed by on-line HPLC MS/MS in parent scanning mode. A strong signal at mass 619, corresponding to haem, was generated by fragmentation of a peptide of mass 1312 that included the sequence CWSCK. Neither this signal nor the haem-containing peptide of mass 1312 was detected in parallel experiments with cytochrome that had been purified from a transformant unable to synthesize NrfE, NrfF and NrfG: this is consistent with our previous report that NrfE and NrfG (but not NrfF) are essential for formate-dependent nitrite reduction. Redox titrations clearly revealed the presence of high and low mid-point potential redox centres. The best fit to the experimental data is for three n=1 components with mid-point redox potentials (pH 7.0) of +45 mV (21% of the total absorbance change), -90 mV (36% of the total) and -210mV (43% of the total). Plasmids in which the lysine codon of the cysteine-lysine motif, AAA, was changed to the histidine codon CAT (to create a fifth 'typical' haem c-binding motif), or to the isoleucine and leucine codons, ATT and CTT, were unable to transform a Nrf deletion mutant to Nrf+ or to restore formate-dependent nitrite reduction to the transformants. The presence of a 50 kDa periplasmic c-type cytochrome was confirmed by staining proteins separated by SDS-PAGE for covalently bound haem, but the methyl-viologen-dependent nitrite reductase activities associated with the mutated proteins, although still detectable, were far lower than that of the native protein. The combined data establish not only that there is a haem group bound covalently to the cysteine-lysine motif of cytochrome c552 but also that one or more products of the last three genes of the nrf operon are essential for the haem ligation to this motif.

TI  - External noise distinguishes attention mechanisms.  
AB  - We developed and tested a powerful method for identifying and characterizing the effect of attention on performance in visual tasks as due to signal enhancement, distractor exclusion, or internal noise suppression. Based on a noisy Perceptual Template Model (PTM) of a human observer, the method adds increasing amounts of external noise (white gaussian random noise) to the visual stimulus and observes the effect on performance of a perceptual task for attended and unattended stimuli. The three mechanisms of attention yield three "signature" patterns of performance. The general framework for characterizing the mechanisms of attention is used here to investigate the attentional mechanisms in a concurrent location-cued orientation discrimination task. Test stimuli--Gabor patches tilted slightly to the right or left--always appeared on both the left and the right of fixation, and varied independently. Observers were cued on each trial to attend to the left, the right, or evenly to both stimuli, and decide the direction of tilt of both test stimuli. For eight levels of added external noise and three attention conditions (attended, unattended, and equal), subjects' contrast threshold levels were determined. At low levels of external noise, attention affected threshold contrast: threshold contrasts for non-attended stimuli were systematically higher than for equal attention stimuli, which were, in turn, higher than for attended stimuli. Specifically, when the rms contrast of the external noise is below 10%, there is a consistent 17% elevation of contrast threshold from attended to unattended condition across all three subjects. For higher levels of external noise, attention conditions did not affect threshold contrast values at all. These strong results are characteristic of a signal enhancement, or equivalently, an internal additive noise reduction mechanism of attention.

AB  - The purpose of this trial was to determine the toxicity and antineoplastic activity of cisplatin, carboplatin, tamoxifen, and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in patients with advanced melanoma. Eleven patients with metastatic melanoma were enrolled. The patients received carboplatin 400 mg/m2 i.v. on day 0; cisplatin 25 mg/m2 i.v. on days 7, 14, and 21; tamoxifen 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. on days 0-27; and interferon-alpha 5 million units/m2 subcutaneously 3 times per week. Cycles were repeated every 28 days. Patients were assessed for tumor response at the end of 2 cycles. Toxicity was severe, with 14 of 24 cycles given requiring some form of dose reduction.  Carboplatin dose reductions were related to bone-marrow toxicity, whereas IFN-alpha caused fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and fever. The overall response rate was 18% (2 partial responses [PRs]). The combination of cisplatin, carboplatin, tamoxifen, and IFN-alpha is active in advanced melanoma; however, the toxicity is unacceptable.

TI  - The beta subunit of the high conductance calcium-activated potassium channel. Identification of residues involved in charybdotoxin binding.  
AB  - Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits of the high conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (maxi-K) channel leads to a 50-fold increase in the affinity for 125I-charybdotoxin (125I-ChTX) as compared with when the alpha subunit is expressed alone (Hanner, M., Schmalhofer, W. A., Munujos, P., Knaus, H.-G., Kaczorowski, G. J., and Garcia, M. L. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 2853-2858). To identify those residues in the beta subunit that are responsible for this change in binding affinity, Ala scanning mutagenesis was carried out along the extracellular loop of beta, and the resulting effects on 125I-ChTX binding were determined after coexpression with the alpha subunit. Mutagenesis of each of the four Cys residues present in the loop causes a large reduction in toxin binding affinity, suggesting that these residues could be forming disulfide bridges. The existence of two disulfide bridges in the extracellular loop of beta was demonstrated after comparison of reactivities of native beta and single-Cys-mutated subunits to N-biotin-maleimide. Negatively charged residues in the loop of beta, when mutated individually or in combinations, had no effect on toxin binding with the exception of Glu94, whose alteration modifies kinetics of ligand association and dissociation. Further mutagenesis studies targeting individual residues between Cys76 and Cys103 indicate that four positions, Leu90, Tyr91, Thr93, and Glu94 are critical in conferring high affinity 125I-ChTX binding to the alpha.beta subunit complex. Mutations at these positions cause large effects on the kinetics of ligand association and dissociation, but they do not alter the physical interaction of beta with the alpha subunit. All these data, taken together, suggest that the large extracellular loop of the maxi-K channel beta subunit has a restricted conformation. Moreover, they are consistent with the view that four residues appear to be important for inducing an appropriate conformation within the alpha subunit that allows high affinity ChTX binding.

TI  - A comparison of supination/flexion to hyperpronation in the reduction of radial head subluxations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare supination at the wrist followed by flexion at the elbow (the traditional reduction technique) to hyperpronation at the wrist in the reduction of radial head subluxations (nursemaid's elbow). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized study involved a consecutive sampling of children younger than 6 years of age who presented to one of two urban pediatric emergency departments and two suburban pediatric ambulatory care centers with a clinical diagnosis of radial head subluxation. Patients were randomized to undergo reduction by one of the two methods and were followed every 5 minutes for return of elbow function. The initial procedure was repeated if baseline functioning did not return 15 minutes after the initial reduction attempt. Failure of that technique 30 minutes after the initial reduction attempt resulted in a cross-over to the alternate method of reduction. The alternate procedure was repeated if baseline functioning did not return 15 minutes after the alternate procedure was attempted. If the patient failed both techniques, radiography of the elbow was performed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study. Five patients were removed from further analysis secondary to a final diagnosis of fracture, 84 were reduced successfully, and 1 failed both techniques. Demographic characteristics of each group were similar. Thirty-nine of 41 patients (95%) randomized to hyper-pronation were reduced successfully on the first attempt versus 34 of 44 patients (77%) randomized to supination. Two patients in the hyperpronation group required two attempts versus 10 patients in the supination group. Hyperpronation was more successful; 40 of 41 patients (97.5%) in the hyperpronation group were reduced successfully versus 38 of 44 patients (86%) in the supination group. Of the 6 patients who crossed over from supination to hyperpronation, 5 were reduced on the first attempt and 1 was reduced on the second attempt. CONCLUSIONS: In the reduction of radial head subluxations, the hyperpronation technique required fewer attempts at reduction compared with supination, was successful more often than supination, and was often successful when supination failed.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of enteral immunonutrition in the critically ill. Guy's Hospital Intensive Care Group [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of enteral immunonutrition (IMN) on hospital mortality and length of stay in a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial with an a priori subgroup analysis according to the volume of feed delivered in the first 72 hrs of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. SETTING: A 13-bed adult general ICU in a London teaching hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 398 patients were enrolled and data from 390 patients (IMN = 193, control = 197) were used for an intention-to-treat analysis. There were 369 patients (IMN = 184, control = 185) who actually received some enteral nutrition, of whom 101 patients (IMN = 50, control = 51) received >2.5 L within 72 hrs of ICU admission. This latter group was defined as the successful "early enteral nutrition" group. INTERVENTIONS: Within 48 hrs of ICU admission, patients were randomized to receive either the IMN Impact (Novartis Nutrition), an enteral feed supplemented with arginine, purine nucleotides and omega-3 fatty acids, or an isocaloric, isonitrogenous control enteral feed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There was no significant difference in hospital mortality rate between the two groups on an intention-to-treat analysis (Impact group 48%, control group 44%) nor in any other predefined subgroup analysis. However, patients randomized to receive the IMN had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (20.1 +/- 7.1 vs. 18.7 +/- 7.1 [p = .07] intention-to-treat [n = 390]; 20.1 +/- 7.2 vs. 18.5 +/- 7.1 [p = .04] received feed [n = 369]). Of the 101 patients achieving early enteral nutrition, those patients fed with the IMN had a significant reduction in their requirement for mechanical ventilation compared with controls (median duration of ventilation 6.0 and 10.5 days, respectively, p = .007) with an associated reduction in the length of hospital stay (medians 15.5 and 20 days, respectively, p = .03). CONCLUSION: While the administration of enteral IMN to a general, critically ill population did not affect mortality, those patients in whom it was possible to achieve early enteral nutrition with Impact had a significant reduction in the morbidity of their critical illness.

TI  - Investigating the mechanism of electron transfer to the binuclear center in Cu-heme oxidases.  
AB  - Novel experimental evidence is presented further supporting the hypothesis that, starting with resting oxidized cytochrome c oxidase, the internal electron transfer to the oxygen binding site is kinetically controlled. The reduction of the enzyme was followed spectroscopically and in the presence of NO or CO, used as trapping ligands for reduced cytochrome a3; ruthenium hexamine was used as a spectroscopically silent electron donor. Consistent with the high combination rate constant for reduced cytochrome a3, NO proved to be a very efficient trapping ligand, while CO did not. The results are discussed in view of two alternative (thermodynamic and kinetic) hypotheses of control of electron transfer to the binuclear (cyt.a3-CuB) center. Fulfilling the prediction of the kinetic control hypothesis: i) the reduction of cytochrome a3 and ligation are synchronous and proceed at the intrinsic rate of cytochrome a3 reduction, ii) the measured rate of formation of the nitrosyl derivative is independent of the concentration of both the reductant and NO.

AB  - The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)-induced polycythemia on renal function and glomerular hemodynamics were evaluated in Munich-Wistar rats (MW+EPO) before and after infusion of indomethacin; the rHuEPO effects on total renal function were also evaluated in 5/6 nephrectomized (CRF) MW and spontaneously hypertensive rats (MW-CRF+EPO and SHR-CRF+EPO, respectively). In normal MW rats, rHuEPO (300 IU/kg BW, 3 x /week, during 2 weeks) induced elevation in MAP, with maintenance of GFR, paralleled by superficial vasodilatation and elevation in SNGFR, suggesting cortical blood redistribution. These hemodynamic alterations induced by rHuEPO were blunted by indomethacin, suggesting a participation of the vasodilator prostaglandins in the renal compensatory mechanism of polycythemia. Elevation in MAP and reduction in GFR occurred in the MW-CRF+EPO group compared with the group receiving vehicle. In contrast, the SHR-CRF+EPO presented a reduction in MAP and maintenance of GFR, suggesting different rHuEPO effects depending on previous renal function and/or hypertensive state.

Whereas the canola oil blends did not differ from each other in their effects on lipoprotein profiles, the TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend resulted in a significant 6% reduction (-0.25 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.42) in total and LDL cholesterol compared with the blend containing TFAs (P = 0.006).

TI  - Oil blends containing partially hydrogenated or interesterified fats: differential effects on plasma lipids.  
AB  - We compared the effects on plasma lipids of margarines containing either a trans fatty acid- (TFA)-free hard fraction achieved through interesterification (from primarily saturated fatty acids) or a partially hydrogenated hard fraction. Thirty-eight mildly hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a low-fat diet for 2 wk. They were then allocated to 2 groups and underwent 3 dietary interventions for 3 wk each in random order (diets contained 35% of energy as fat with 20% of energy as margarines or butter): group 1 (n = 18), butter, canola oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free canola oil blend: group 2 (n = 19), butter, polyunsaturated oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations after consumption of all oil blends and after the low-fat diet were not significantly different, but were 11-15% lower than after butter (P < 0.001). Whereas the canola oil blends did not differ from each other in their effects on lipoprotein profiles, the TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend resulted in a significant 6% reduction (-0.25 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.42) in total and LDL cholesterol compared with the blend containing TFAs (P = 0.006). In the canola oil blend, 10% TFAs and 6% oleic acid were replaced by approximately 14% saturated fatty acids plus a 2% increase in linoleic acid. In the polyunsaturated oil blend, 10% TFAs and 5% linoleic acid were replaced by a 10% increase in saturated fatty acids as well as 3% and 1% increases in oleic and linolenic acids, respectively. We conclude that, compared with butter, TFA-free margarines may be equal to or more effective than margarines containing TFAs in lowering LDL cholesterol.

TI  - Sp1 and related factors fail to interact with the NF-kappaB-proximal G/C box in the LTR of a replication competent, brain-derived strain of HIV-1 (YU-2).  
AB  - The HIV-1 LTR promoter proximal G/C box array has been demonstrated to function by interacting with the Sp1 transcription factor family whose members can act as either activators or repressors of transcription. In this regard, we have examined the interaction of the HIV-1 Sp binding sites with nuclear factors that are present in cell types that support HIV-1 replication, including those of lymphocytic, monocytic, and astrocytic origin. As determined by electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) competition analyses using oligonucleotides containing the sequences of each of the Sp1 sites of HIV-1 strain LAI, the NF-kappaB-proximal Sp site (site III) displayed the highest binding activity compared to sites I and II with regard to Sp1 and related factors present in lymphocytic (Jurkat) and astrocytic (U-373 MG) nuclear extracts. Sp1 and two Sp3 isoforms were detected as the primary cellular constituents of DNA-protein complexes formed with the NF-kappaB-proximal site. Only modest differences in Sp1:Sp3 binding ratios were observed when this site was reacted with either astrocytic or lymphocytic nuclear extract. However, when nuclear extracts derived from two monocytic cell types that differ in the degree of differentiation were reacted with the HIV-1 LAI Sp site III, a large difference in Sp1 and Sp3 binding was observed. To determine if naturally occurring and replication-competent strains of HIV-1 contain base pair alterations within the Sp elements that affect the ability of the site to interact with Sp1 and related factors, a series of Sp site III variants were constructed and examined by EMS analyses. One of these sites, obtained from the published sequence of the YU-2 strain (a brain-derived macrophage tropic strain of HIV-1), displayed almost no Sp1 or Sp3 binding activity as a result of a single base pair alteration in Sp site III. This base-pair alteration, when placed in the context of an HIV-1 LAI LTR-luciferase construct, resulted in a 40-50% reduction in LTR activity in transiently transfected Jurkat and U-373 MG cells. Overall, these results suggest that specific G/C box sequence alterations present in the brain-derived HIV-1 variant YU-2, or possibly other brain-derived variants, may exhibit altered replication properties as a result of the low affinity of the NF-kappaB-proximal G/C box for members of the Sp transcription factor family.

TI  - Nearest-neighbor analysis of a photosystem II complex from Marchantia polymorpha L. (liverwort), which contains reaction center and antenna proteins.  
AB  - A new photosystem II preparation was isolated from Marchantia polymorpha thylakoids upon solubilization with dodecyl beta-D-maltoside and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. Its protein composition was analyzed, and all tested polypeptides from the core complex, the oxygen-evolving enhancer and the light-harvesting complex (LHC) could be detected. The only component severely depleted compared with the grana membrane preparation was the psbS gene product. This complex was subjected to chemical cross-linking using the cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate). The overall pattern of cross-linking-products was analyzed by diagonal electrophoresis, where the cross-linking agent was cleaved by reduction of the disulfide bond between the first and second dimensions of the gel, followed by immunoblotting. Many cross-linking products were characterized and these data used in order to identify protein masses revealed by electron microscopy [Boekema, E. J., Hankamer, B., Bald, D., Kruip, J., Nield, J., Boonstra, A. F., Barber, J. & Rogner, M. (1995) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 92, 175-179]. It is concluded that the core proteins CP43 and CP47 are located at opposite sides of the D1-D2-cytochrome b559 complex. Minor CAB proteins were found to interact with core complex subunits (CP29, CP26) and LHCII (CP26), supporting the view that these proteins could interface the major LHCII with the reaction center.

TI  -  Reduction in arteriovenous graft impairment: results of a vascular access surveillance protocol.  
AB  - Impairment of hemodialysis (HD) vascular access, remains a frustrating problem for both the patient who possesses an arteriovenous graft (AVG) and the nephrologist who cares for the patient. We instituted a vascular access surveillance protocol intended to detect and correct evolving stenosis in patients with AVGs. The principal screen was the observation of dynamic venous pressure (VP) at a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min during the first 5 minutes of each HD session. If VP at a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min was 140 mm Hg or greater in three of six consecutive readings, recirculation greater than 15% on two observations, graft-arm swelling observed, or prolonged bleeding postdialysis observed, then the patient was referred for angiography and then angioplasty or surgery if a vascular stenosis of greater than 50% was documented. Sixty-four patients with a synthetic AVG comprised the study group. Seventy-two episodes of AVG impairment (56 with stenosis > or = 50% on angiography, 16 with thrombosis) occurred in these patients during the study period. In 63 of 72 impairment episodes, the preceding vascular access screening test was positive. The calculated sensitivity and specificity of the vascular access protocol was 88% and 81%, respectively. Calculation of the sensitivity and specificity for the VP alone was 81% and 85%, respectively. Comparison of the study group with a similar historical control group (55 patients) showed a significantly lower thrombosis rate (P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.025 to 0.375) in the study group (0.29 thrombotic episodes/graft-year at risk) versus the historical control group (0.49 thrombotic episodes/graft-year at risk). In summary, a vascular access surveillance protocol is a useful tool to predict patients at risk for AVG venous stenosis and/or thrombosis. A dynamic VP of 140 mm Hg or greater appears to be the optimal threshold pressure. A decrease in synthetic AVG thrombosis rate resulted from the use of this surveillance protocol.

TI  - Impact of adopting lower-fat food choices on nutrient intake of American children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall nutrient intake of American children (ages 2 to 19) who exclusively use skim milk instead of 1%, 2%, or whole milk; lean meats instead of higher-fat meats; or fat-modified products instead of full-fat products. STUDY DESIGN: A unique sorting procedure was used to categorize respondents to the 1989-1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals according to reported use or nonuse of certain fat-reduction strategies. Differences in intake of 23 macronutrients and micronutrients, as well as energy, by exclusive users, mixed users, and nonusers of each strategy were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance with Scheffe's test. The number of fat-reduction strategies used by the children as well as demographic characteristics also were analyzed. RESULTS: Only a small number of children qualified as exclusive users of skim milk (3%), lean meats (2%), and fat-modified products (1%). Energy intakes for all children were below 100% of the recommended dietary allowance. However, children (n = 85) who used skim milk exclusively in place of higher-fat milks closely approximated the current dietary recommendations (30% energy from fat, less than 10% from saturated fat, and less than 300 mg cholesterol) while maintaining adequate micronutrient intake and without significantly impacting energy. Children (n = 52) who used lean meats in place of higher-fat meats achieved the guideline for total fat; however, energy intake was 70% of the recommended dietary allowance and vitamin E was 63%. Children (n = 20) who use only fat-modified versions of cheese, salad dressing, cake, pudding, and yogurt made no significant impact on their energy, fat, or micronutrient intake. Of the 3299 children in the data set, only 3 qualified as users of two fat-reduction strategies and none qualified as users of all three strategies. Exclusive users of skim milk, lean meat, or fat-modified products were more likely to be female, white, and live in families with higher incomes. Those using skim milk or lean meat exclusively also were more likely to be older, whereas those exclusively using fat-modified products were younger. Furthermore, those using skim milk or fat-modified products exclusively were more likely to live in households where the head had more years of education, whereas those exclusively using lean meats were from households headed by those with slightly less years of education. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent limitations of population-based food surveys (including issues of underreporting, lack of biological markers and accurate anthropometric measures, and limited nutrient databases), these results provide insight into the rate of use of certain lower-fat food choices by children and suggest exclusive use can facilitate achievement of contemporary dietary recommendations. The impact of using these fat-reduction strategies on children's overall nutrient intake differs depending on the strategy used. Use of skim milk is an economical single-food strategy that facilitates achievement of contemporary dietary guidelines while maintaining nutrient adequacy. Professional guidance is recommended for children who exclusively use lean meats to assure adequate intake of energy and vitamin E. The impact of fat-modified products needs to be monitored closely as the number of such products increases in the marketplace. Results of this study can be used by health professionals working with children and their parents to highlight the overall efficacy of dietary recommendations while alerting them to potential pitfalls.

TI  - Fate of bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms in liquid sweeteners.  
AB  - The survival of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms in liquid sweeteners was studied. Seven sweeteners--liquid sucrose, 42% high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), 55% HFCS, 25 DE (dextrose equivalent) corn syrup (CS), 36 DE CS, 63 DE CS, 50% medium invert sucrose, and 65% high-maltose corn syrup (HMCS) were inoculated with Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coliforms at a level of 10(5) cells per g. The inoculated products were stored both at or near their normal holding temperatures (32 to 46 degrees C) and at 26.7 degrees C (the lower limit during transportation). In most of the products the number of microorganisms fell below the detection limit in less than 3 days when the sweeteners were stored at their normal holding temperatures. However, in liquid sucrose S aureus survived up to 2 weeks. When the products were stored at 26.7 degrees C, the reduction in the number of microorganisms occurred at a slower rate. At 26.7 degrees C the fastest rates of reduction were observed in 42 and 55% HFCS and in 50% medium invert sucrose. In these products the number of bacteria fell below the detection limit in 3 to 6 days. The slowest rate of the reduction was observed in the liquid sucrose, in which S. aureus survived up to 1 month. These results indicate that incidental contamination of liquid sweeteners with microbial pathogens will not present a public health or regulatory hazard.

TI  - Biliary secretion of endotoxin and pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis.  
AB  - Previous studies suggested endotoxin, derived from the intestine through the portal blood to the liver, was predominantly metabolized by Kupffer cells. In the present study, fluorescent-labeled endotoxin injected into the rat portal vein was demonstrated not only in Kupffer cells but also in hepatocytes. Furthermore a great amount of labeled endotoxin was recovered in bile. In the livers of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), immunohistochemistry demonstrated significant retention of endotoxin in the biliary epithelial cells, and treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid significantly reduced the retention in those cells. The study for detection of apoptosis demonstrated increased rates of apoptosis in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells in PBC liver, and the rate of apoptosis in biliary epithelial cells was significantly reduced after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Immunohistochemistry in PBC liver demonstrated significant reduction of fluorescence intensity for a 7H6 antigen in biliary epithelial cells, indicating the increased paracellular permeability of bile ducts, because cellular immunolocalization of that antigen has been shown to be inversely correlated with the paracellular permeability of the tight junction. These results suggest that, in biliary epithelial cells, retention of endotoxin, increased apoptosis, and increased permeability of tight junctions may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.

TI  - [Effect of pamidronate on clinical symptoms and bone metabolism in fibrous dysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with fibrous dysplasia and the McCune-Albright syndrome which is characterized by additional endocrine dysfunctions, such as pubertas precox, suffer from a regional impairment in the differentiation of osteoblasts that is acquired during early embryogenesis and results in fibrous bone lesions. These lesions may cause bone deformities, fractures and chronical pain in the affected skeletal regions. We here report about our experience with a systemic treatment of the bisphosphonate pamidronate. PATIENTS: We treated 3 patients with fibrous dysplasia and 5 patients with McCune-Albright syndrome over a cumulative period of 37 patient-years. RESULTS: In all patients who suffered from painful lesions, intravenous infusions of 60 mg pamidronate resulted in an improvement of pain that lasted up to 6 months. In 2 patients we also observed a reduction in the size of some of the osteolytic lesions. Side effects were limited to asymptomatical fever and a small decline in total serum calcium within the physiological limits during the infusions. CONCLUSION: Pamidronate appears to be an effective and well tolerable treatment option for patients with fibrous dysplasia.

TI  - Minimally invasive management for first and recurrent pneumothorax.  
AB  - Minimally invasive techniques for treatment of pneumothorax should yield the standard of results set with open procedures: the operative morbidity should remain less than 15%, and the recurrence rate less than 1%. In the era before video-assisted thoracic surgery, two minimally invasive variants were used. Chemical pleurodesis resulted in an unsatisfactory recurrence rate of at least 15%. In contrast, pleurectomy and apical stapling performed through a transaxillary minithoracotomy compared favorably with larger thoracotomy approaches, and allowed a reduced hospital stay. Evaluation of video-assisted thoracic surgical operations for spontaneous pneumothorax is hampered by a lack of controlled studies. The general impression is that morbidity did not decline significantly; the main determinant of complications is the patient's underlying health status. However, published recurrence rates range from 5% to 10%, in spite of a shorter follow-up time span. Optimized results are achieved when classic principles combining apical wedge resection and pleurodesis are applied. Reduction of hospital stay is not only a result of the new technology, but also changing drainage and discharge policies.  Reduction of cost is debatable, because many studies do not consider the cost of video equipment. The main advantage when compared with open thoracotomy is reduction of postoperative pain. The only two available controlled studies conclude that there is no obvious advantage of video-assisted thoracic surgery when compared with conventional limited-access surgery. The future role of video-assisted thoracic surgery in this disease remains to be determined by a large-scale prospective evaluation.

TI  - The role of maternal VegT in establishing the primary germ layers in Xenopus embryos [see comments]  
AB  - VegT is a T-box transcription factor whose mRNA is synthesized during oogenesis and localized in the vegetal hemisphere of the egg and early embryo. We show that maternally expressed VegT controls the pattern of primary germ layer specification in Xenopus embryos.  Reduction of the maternal store completely alters the fates of different regions of the blastula so that animal cell fate is changed from epidermis and nervous system to epidermis only, equatorial cell fate is changed from mesoderm to ectoderm, and vegetal cell fate is changed from endoderm to mesoderm and ectoderm. Vegetal cells lose their capacity both to form endoderm and to release mesoderm-inducing signals. These results show that a single maternally expressed gene controls the patterning of the Xenopus blastula.

TI  - Effect of the high-affinity estrogen receptor ligand ICI 182,780 on the rat tibia.  
AB  - We examined the specificity of the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) on bone and reproductive tissues in adult and growing female rats. Using a 1.5-mg/kg dose (s.c.), we evaluated the effects of ICI on the bone, body weight, uterine weight, serum cholesterol, and serum estradiol in either adult and/or growing rats. ICI increased serum estradiol cholesterol in ovary-intact rats, had no effect on uterine weight in ovariectomized rats, and resulted in uterine atrophy in ovary-intact animals comparable with ovariectomy. In contrast, ICI had no effect on body weight. In bone, ICI significantly increased the rate of periosteal bone formation in long bones of growing and mature female rats. In contrast, ICI had no effect on longitudinal bone growth in rapidly growing rats. When ICI was administered to mature rats with or without ovaries, two-factor ANOVA revealed significant interaction (P < or = 0.05) between ovariectomy and ICI treatment for cancellous bone area and labeled bone perimeter. ICI increased skeletal indices of bone turnover in the cancellous bone of ovary-intact rats but reduced these indices of bone turnover in the cancellous bone of ovariectomized rats. The increase in bone turnover was associated with a reduction in cancellous bone area in the ovary-intact rats.  A reduction in bone turnover was similarly associated with an increase in bone area in the ICI-treated ovariectomized rats. In summary, ICI exhibited complete estrogen antagonism in cortical and cancellous bone, partial agonism in cancellous bone, and no activity on tibial longitudinal growth rate of growing ovary-intact rats. The effects in adult rats were influenced by circulating levels of estradiol. ICI had no activity on body weight and complete antagonism on uterine weight. These results demonstrate that a ligand with high binding affinity to the estrogen receptor(s) can elicit an array of estrogen-mediated regulation of bone metabolism.

TI  - Characterization of behavioral and neurodegenerative changes following partial lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine system induced by intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat.  
AB  - Partial lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine system have been investigated with respect to their ability to induce consistent long-lasting deficits in movement initiation and skilled forelimb use. In eight different lesion groups 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was injected at one, two, three, or four sites into the lateral sector of the right striatum, in a total dose of 20-30 microgram. Impairments in movement initiation in a forelimb stepping test, and in skilled paw use in a paw-reaching test, was seen only in animals where the severity of the lesion exceeded a critical threshold, which was different for the different tests used: single (1 x 20 microgram) or two-site (2 x 10 microgram) injections into the striatum had only small affects on forelimb stepping, no effect on skilled paw use. More pronounced deficits were obtained in animals where the same total dose of 6-OHDA was distributed over three or four sites along the rostro-caudal extent of the lateral striatum or where the injections were made close to the junction of the globus pallidus. The results show that a 60-70% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fiber density in the lateral striatum, accompanied by a 50-60% reduction in TH-positive cells in substantia nigra (SN), is sufficient for the induction of significant impairment in initiation of stepping. Impaired skilled paw-use, on the other hand, was obtained only with a four-site (4 x 7 microgram) lesion, which induced 80-95% reduction in TH fiber density throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the lateral striatum and a 75% loss of TH-positive neurons in SN. Drug-induced rotation, by contrast, was observed also in animals with more restricted presymptomatic lesions. The results indicate that the four-site intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion may be a relevant model of the neuropathology seen in parkinsonian patients in a manifest symptomatic stage of the disease and may be particularly useful experimentally since it leaves a significant portion of the nigrostriatal projection intact which can serve as a substrate for regeneration and functional recovery in response to growth promoting and neuroprotective agents.

TI  - Natural competence for DNA transformation in Helicobacter pylori: identification and genetic characterization of the comB locus.  
AB  - The gram-negative bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, an important aetiological agent of gastroduodenal disease in humans, belongs to a group of bacterial species displaying competence for genetic transformation. Here, we describe the comB gene locus of H. pylori involved in DNA transformation competence. It consists of a cluster of four tandemly arranged genes with partially overlapping open reading frames, orf2, comB1, comB2 and comB3, constituting a single transcriptional unit. Orf2 encodes a 37-amino-acid peptide carrying a signal sequence, whereas comB1, comB2 and comB3 produce 29 kDa, 38 kDa and 42 kDa proteins, respectively, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with specific antisera. For Orf2 and ComB1, no homologous proteins were identified in the database. For ComB3, the best homologies were found with TraS/TraB from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa conjugative plasmid RP1 and TrbI of plasmid RP4, VirB10 from the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and PtlG, a protein involved in secretion of pertussis toxin of Bordetella pertussis. Defined transposon knock-out mutants in individual comB genes resulted in transformation-defective phenotypes ranging from a 90% reduction to a complete loss of the natural transformation efficiency. The comB2 and comB3 genes show homology to HP0528 and HP0527, respectively, located on the cagII pathogenicity island of H. pylori strain 26695.

TI  - Differential effects of intracerebroventricular glucagon-like peptide-1 on feeding and energy expenditure regulation.  
AB  - Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-37) amide (GLP-1) has been shown to modulate food and water intake. The present studies further characterize the effects of i.c.v. GLP-1 in the regulation of energy balance in lean and obese animals. In both obese and lean Zucker rats, a single i.c.v. infusion of GLP-1 (1-30 microg) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of food intake and decrease in respiratory quotient relative to the saline control during the first 2 h of the nocturnal cycle. In obese Zucker rats, the food intake was reduced by 73 +/- 11% of the control at the 30 microg dose, whereas a modest 45 +/- 18% reduction was observed in lean rats. Despite the large reduction in food intake seen with GLP-1, there was no compensatory decrease in nocturnal oxygen consumption in the obese Zucker rats. Interestingly, low doses of GLP-1 (1 microg) in lean Zucker rats, which had minimal effects on food intake, caused a 19 +/- 7% increase in O2 consumption during the first 2 h of the nocturnal cycle. These data suggest that central GLP-1 may be an important factor controlling negative energy balance in both the lean and obese Zucker rats.

TI  - Influence of receptor reserve on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in human lung mast cells.  
AB  - 1. The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline and salbutamol on IgE-mediated histamine release from human lung mast cells (HLMC) were evaluated. Both agonists (10(-10)-10(-5) M) inhibited histamine release in a dose-dependent manner and isoprenaline (pD2, 8.3+/-0.1, mean+/-s.e.mean) was more potent than salbutamol (7.3+/-0.1). Moreover, the mean data indicated that salbutamol was a partial agonist when compared with isoprenaline. However, there was a large degree of interexperimental variability because, in 11 of 32 experiments, salbutamol was a full agonist and, in 21 of 32 experiments, a partial agonist relative to isoprenaline. These data suggest that different HLMC preparations possess variable receptor reserves. 2. The effect of the irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bromoacetylalprenolol menthane (BAAM), on the inhibition of IgE-mediated histamine release by both isoprenaline and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was assessed. Whereas BAAM (100 nM) antagonized the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release from activated HLMC, BAAM had no effect on the PGE2 inhibition. Pretreatment of HLMC with the beta2-selective competitive antagonist, ICI 118551 (100 nM), protected against the loss in responsiveness to isoprenaline following treatment with BAAM. 3. Concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 nM of BAAM caused dose-dependent rightward shifts in the dose-response curve for the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the maximal inhibitory response obtained with isoprenaline following treatments with increasing concentrations of BAAM. Although the rightward shifts in the isoprenaline dose-response curves, with a given concentration of BAAM, were similar in all experiments, there was some variability in the depression of the maximal response in individual experiments. Thus, in 6 of 16 experiments, BAAM (1 nM) did not depress the maximal response to isoprenaline, whereas in 10 of 16 experiments there was a depression (7 to 49% reduction) in the maximal response. These data suggest that different HLMC preparations possess variable receptor reserves. 4. Isoprenaline was more potent as an inhibitor in those HLMC preparations in which there was a larger receptor reserve (i.e. preparations in which the maximal inhibitory response to isoprenaline was unaffected by pretreatment with 1 nM BAAM). 5. The influence of receptor reserve on the inhibition by salbutamol of histamine release from HLMC was evaluated. There was a good correlation (r=0.77) between receptor reserve and the maximal response (relative to isoprenaline) obtained with salbutamol. Thus, HLMC preparations with larger receptor reserves were more responsive to salbutamol. 6. Receptor reserve influenced the desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in HLMC. Cells were incubated (24 h) with isoprenaline (1 microM), washed and then the ability of a second isoprenaline (10(-10)-10(-5) M) exposure to inhibit histamine release was assessed. The pretreatment caused a reduction in the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release although the extent of desensitization was highly variable, ranging from essentially negligible levels in some preparations to substantial reductions (93% desensitization) in the ability of isoprenaline to inhibit histamine release. There was a reasonable correlation (r=0.59) between receptor reserve and desensitization. Preparations that possessed a larger receptor reserve were more resistant to desensitization. 7. Collectively, these data suggest that a receptor reserve exists for the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of histamine release from HLMC but that the size of this reserve varies between HLMC preparations. Moreover, the size of this receptor reserve may i

TI  - Dimensions of subjective uncertainty in social identification and minimal intergroup discrimination.  
AB  - Social categorization under minimal group conditions reliably produces intergroup discrimination. It is proposed that this might be because the minimal group paradigm engenders high levels of subjective uncertainty among participants, which causes them to use the categorization to define self and thus identify with the minimal group. Uncertainty is generally an aversive state which may be resolved by identification (Hogg, 1996; Hogg & Abrams, 1993). Thus, people may identify with social categories (and express discrimination) when identification resolves uncertainty. To investigate this idea a standard minimal group experiment was conducted, in which the three independent variables of categorizations, task uncertainty and situational uncertainty were manipulated in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial between-subjects design. Point distribution strategies were measured along with in-group identification, self-esteem, social awareness and, at three occasions, uncertainty about the task and situation. As predicted, under conditions of high task or situational uncertainty, categorized participants identified more with their minimal in-group and exhibited more intergroup discrimination than other participants. There was also some evidence that identification reduced uncertainty. There was only partial support for the mediational role of identification, and similarly, for self-esteem as a derivative motive. These findings are interpreted as supporting an uncertainty reduction model of social identification and group motivation.

TI  - The A1 allele of the human D2 dopamine receptor gene predicts low D2 receptor availability in healthy volunteers.  
AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have revealed significant interindividual variation in dopamine D2 receptor density in vivo in human striatum. Low D2 receptor binding in vivo has been found to associate with alcohol/substance dependence. It has been suggested that the A1 allele of human D2 receptor gene might be associated to a specific type of alcoholism and possibly to a reduced D2 receptor density in vitro. We have determined D2 dopamine receptor-binding density (Bmax), affinity (Kd) and availability (Bmax/Kd) in 54 healthy Finnish volunteers using PET and [11C]raclopride in order to determine whether the A1 allele is associated with a 'baseline' difference in D2 receptor characteristics in vivo.  A statistically significant reduction in D2 receptor availability reflecting an alteration in receptor density was observed in the A1/A2 genotype group compared to the A2/A2 group. There was no difference in apparent Kd between the two groups. In conclusion, the association between the A1 allele and low D2 receptor availability in healthy subjects indicates that the A1 allele of the TaqIA polymorphism might be in linkage disequilibrium with a mutation in the promoter/regulatory gene element that affects dopamine D2 receptor expression. This study provides an in vivo neurobiological correlate to the A1 allele in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Extrahepatic biliary obstruction by metastatic gastric carcinoma.  
AB  - Forty-one patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction by metastatic gastric carcinoma underwent retrospective study to determine demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings on presentation, time interval from previous gastrectomy, level of biliary obstruction, methods of palliation, complications from treatment, treatment results, and survival. Thirty-seven patients underwent biliary decompression by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) (35 patients), endoscopic insertion of plastic stent (one patient), and operative insertion of T tube (1 patient). The remaining 4 patients had no biliary drainage procedure performed. Subsequently expandable metallic biliary stents were inserted in 9 patients through the PTBD tract. Two patients received postdrainage external irradiation.  Reduction in serum total bilirubin was seen in all patients after drainage. Two patients were alive at the time of this analysis. The median survival of these 41 patients was only 70 days. The 6- and 9-month survival rates were 27.0% and 9.7%, respectively. Hemoglobin (p < 0.001) and total bilirubin (p < 0.002) on presentation were found to be independent factors predicting survival. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction by metastatic gastric carcinoma was associated with poor survival. Patients with profound anemia or jaundice on presentation carried the worst prognosis.

TI  - Clonidine reduces dopamine and increases GABA in the nucleus accumbens: an in vivo microdialysis study.  
AB  - The effects of clonidine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, on extracellular concentrations of dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the nucleus accumbens of rats were studied by using in vivo brain microdialysis. Clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) significantly decreased the brain microdialysate concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens up to a maximum of 16% at its peak effect. This effect was inhibited by a dose of idazoxan (10 microg/kg i.v.), an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist. which itself did not affect the efflux of dopamine. A smaller dose of clonidine (1 microg/kg i.v.), which had no significant effect on dopamine efflux per se, decreased the dopamine efflux (21% reduction) when given together with an ineffective dose of midazolam (0.075 mg/kg i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist. The effect of clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) on mesolimbic dopamine efflux was abolished by bicuculline (1 mg/kg i.v.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, counteracted by beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE, 3 mg/kg i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, but not affected by flumazenil (6 microg/kg i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Clonidine (5 microg/kg i.v.) increased the dialysate concentration of GABA in the nucleus accumbens up to a maximum of 250% at its peak effect, but not in the ventral tegmental area. It is hypothesized that GABA(A) binding sites in the nucleus accumbens form part of the sequence of events that is triggered by clonidine in an alpha2-adrenergic-specific manner and that ultimately results in a decreased release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.

These results suggest that the susceptibility to NMDA neurotoxicity that is enhanced in the rat pontine nucleus near postnatal day 15 is mediated by the NMDA receptor channels that are relatively insensitive to Mg2+ and that the reduction in the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to Mg2+ correlates with the expression of the NR2C.

TI  - Functional change of NMDA receptors related to enhancement of susceptibility to neurotoxicity in the developing pontine nucleus.  
AB  - The developing neurons have been reported to be extremely susceptible to toxicity of NMDA during a restricted developmental period. Pontosubicular neuronal necrosis is a typical type of perinatal human brain lesion and often coexists with other forms of cerebral hypoxic and ischemic injuries. To determine whether functional changes of NMDA receptors related to the susceptibility to NMDA toxicity are involved in developing neurons in the pontine nucleus, we have examined the lesion produced by in vivo direct injection of NMDA into the pontine nucleus of rats at postnatal days 1-30, recorded NMDA-induced whole-cell currents from neurons in the pontine nucleus in the developing rat brainstem slices, and performed in situ hybridization for NMDA receptor subunit mRNAs in the pontine nucleus. The susceptibility to NMDA neurotoxicity peaked near postnatal day 15, and the NMDA-induced currents showed prominent reduction of the voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ near postnatal day 15. The pontine nucleus near postnatal day 15 showed distinct expression of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2C mRNA. These results suggest that the susceptibility to NMDA neurotoxicity that is enhanced in the rat pontine nucleus near postnatal day 15 is mediated by the NMDA receptor channels that are relatively insensitive to Mg2+ and that the reduction in the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to Mg2+ correlates with the expression of the NR2C. We present the possibility that functional changes in the NMDA receptor channels play a crucial role in the occurrence of developmentally specific neuronal injury.

Treatment with AG was started on day 7, 14, 28 or 66 post-inoculation and continued for a minimum of 21 days. Inflammation, demyelination and axonal necrosis were scored in a blinded fashion on spinal cord sections from each mouse.  Reduction in inflammation, demyelination and axonal necrosis was observed in mice treated with AG. Apoptosis within the spinal cord parenchyma and perivascular cuffs was significantly decreased. AG treatment resulted in delayed onset of clinical disease.
