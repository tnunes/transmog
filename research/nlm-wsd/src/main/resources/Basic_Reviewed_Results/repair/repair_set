TI  - Low level of DNA repair in human chromosome 1 heterochromatin.  
AB  - Band 1q12 is a breakage prone region commonly involved in chromosome 1 rearrangements found in human cancer. We have investigated whether a lack of DNA repair can account for the observed 1q12 fragility. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced repair sites originating in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle were converted to chromosome breaks by blocking the re-synthesis step of excision repair with cytosine arabinoside. Thus, unfilled repair gaps reached S-phase and were detected as chromosome breaks after cell division. Chromosome breakage in the overall genome was monitored by scoring of micronuclei. Breaks in 1q12 were detected in interphase lymphocytes by in situ hybridization with tandem probes targeting the chromosome 1 centromere (D1Z5) and the adjacent heterochromatic band 1q12(pUC1.77). Mitomycin-C (0.12 and 0.24 micrograms/ml) and X-rays (1 and 2 Gy) were used as positive controls to check the suitability of the tandem labelling approach in detecting 1q12 clastogenicity. Our data indicated that, although the methodology was suitable to detect 1q12 breakage and a high level of overall genome DNA repair occurred, there was a low level of EMS-induced DNA repair sites in 1q12 converted to chromosome breaks. This finding was consistent throughout G1 phase, suggesting that there is a relatively low level of DNA excision repair in human chromosome 1 heterochromatin.

TI  - Green Lane Hospital experience with mitral valve repair for prolapse: adverse outcomes for highly symptomatic patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Valve repair, where suitable, is the preferred option in patients who require mitral surgery. A number of studies have shown excellent long-term results, but most were undertaken in tertiary referral centers with a high throughput of patients. METHODS: We present our experience in 60 patients, aged 60 +/- 14 years, undergoing repair between 1984 and 1993. Most patients (83%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III at the time of surgery; 27% had concomitant ischemic heart disease. Almost all (98%) had posterior leaflet repair and 18% had anterior leaflet repair. Eight surgeons each performed a mean of 7.5 operations during this period. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 3.3%. There were seven late deaths. Five patients underwent reoperation for mitral regurgitation (two early, three late). At six years, 60% of patients were alive, or free of stroke or reoperation. Late follow up was obtained in 45 of 47 surviving patients: 95% were in NYHA class I or II; one-third were on anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation; 90% had mild (or less) mitral regurgitation on echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that most patients have a very good outcome from valve repair surgery and encourage the trend towards operating earlier in the course of the disease. Adverse outcomes occurred mainly in patients who were highly symptomatic at the time of surgery. The high proportion of patients on postoperative anticoagulants underscores the importance of operating before atrial fibrillation becomes permanent.

AB  - This report describes a new technique for the intraoperative repair of a conjunctival tear during trabeculectomy. A single suture was used in a "clothesline" fashion to wall off the conjunctival defect from the aqueous flow, allowing the defect to scar closed. This technique will allow the surgeon to salvage a functioning bleb, thereby avoiding more radical surgical options.

TI  - Repair pattern in the beta-globin gene cluster of human fibroblasts after ultraviolet irradiation.  
AB  - We have developed a novel technique to determine repair of structurally different DNA lesions. It was used to address the question of whether DNA repair in the absence of transcription occurs in a uniformly random manner or with preferences for certain regions. Human fibroblasts were exposed to ultraviolet light (3-10 J/m2) and treated with 7.5 mM hydroxyurea to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. During the first hours after irradiation cells were treated with 5-bromodeoxyuridine to label the regions undergoing repair, with the presumption that the regions that have been more efficiently repaired would incorporate more of the nucleoside. A 155-kb DNA sequence containing the entire human beta-globin domain was reconstructed using sequences deposited in the EMBL gene bank. Twelve uniformly long single-copy RNA probes spanning the beta-globin cluster were synthesised in vitro and immobilized on microtiter plates. They were hybridized with DNA from the irradiated cells. The amount of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, incorporated as a result of repair in the DNA fractions hybridized to the different RNA probes, was determined immunochemically using antibody to this nucleoside. By this technique we registered increased repair efficiency in the zone of the permanent scaffold attachment region at the 5'-end of the beta-globin domain during the first hours after ultraviolet irradiation. This result was confirmed and by the more conventional T4 endonuclease V technique detecting the removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.

TI  - The effect of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) on the healing of full-thickness defects of articular cartilage.  
AB  - Articular cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. We investigated the effect of rhBMP-2 (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2) on the healing of full-thickness osteochondral defects in adult New Zealand White rabbits. A single defect, three millimeters wide by three millimeters deep, was created in the trochlear groove of the right femur in eighty-nine rabbits. The defect was either left empty, filled with a plain collagen sponge, or filled with a collagen sponge impregnated with five micrograms of rhBMP-2. The animals were killed at four, eight, or twenty-four weeks, and the repair tissue was examined histologically and evaluated with use of a grading scale. The defects also were examined immunohistochemically for the presence of type-II collagen at four and eight weeks. The rate of bone repair was evaluated with fluorescent labeling of bone at two and four weeks and with use of fluorescence microscopy at eight weeks. Treatment with rhBMP-2 greatly accelerated the formation of new subchondral bone and improved the histological appearance of the overlying articular surface. At twenty-four weeks, the thickness of the repair cartilage was 70 per cent that of the normal adjacent cartilage and a new tidemark usually had formed between the repair cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. The average total scores on the histological grading scale were significantly better (p < 0.01) for the defects treated with rhBMP-2 than for the untreated defects (those left empty or filled with a plain collagen sponge) at all time-points. Immunostaining with an antibody against type-II collagen showed the diffuse presence of this cartilage-specific collagen throughout the repair cartilage in the treated defects. The untreated defects demonstrated minimum staining with this antibody.

TI  - Type-II collagen gene expression is transiently upregulated in experimentally induced degeneration of rabbit intervertebral disc.  
AB  - To clarify phenotypic alterations of intervertebral disc cells during the repair process, we cloned partial type-II collagen cDNA from rabbits and analyzed the level of expression of type-II collagen mRNA in disc degeneration. An animal model was created by surgical denucleation of rabbit intervertebral discs through an extraperitoneal approach. Eight animals each from an experimental and a control group were killed at 2, 4, 8, or 16 weeks postoperatively, and the disc samples were used for this study. Round chondrocyte-like cells that filled the herniated space showed intense signal of type-II collagen mRNA and significant pericellular immunostaining of type-II collagen but no clear staining of type-I collagen. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of type-II collagen mRNA of the repair disc cells was transiently increased at 4 weeks postoperatively. The cells were able to change their morphology in response to mechanical stimulation by surgical denucleation and to induce a significant increase in the gene expression of type-II collagen at an early phase of disc degeneration. The present results indicate the transient enhancement of repair activity in the degenerative process of injured fibrocartilage.

TI  - Preservation of denervated muscle by sensory protection in rats.  
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine whether sensory motor nerve crossover could alter post-denervation atrophy of skeletal muscle. Sixty adult Lewis rats were divided into three groups: 1) unilateral transection of the tibial nerve alone; 2) unilateral transection of the tibial nerve with immediate repair; and 3) unilateral tibial and sural nerve transections with repair of the proximal sural nerve (sensory) to the distal tibial nerve (motor). The unoperated hind legs acted as positive controls. At 1 and 2 months postoperatively, posterior compartment musculature was harvested, weighed, then fixed and stained for histologic analysis. One month postoperatively, mean muscle weight in Group 1 animals (transection alone) was 23.0 +/- 2.6 percent of the control side; for Group 2 animals (motor-motor repair) was 40.9 +/- 42 percent; and for the sensory-protected Group 3 animals (sensory-motor repair) was 26.7 +/- 2.8 percent of controls (n = 15 per group). Two months postoperatively, the mean weights were 14.5 +/- 0.9 percent, 58.8 +/- 7.3 percent, and 21.1 +/- 3.1 percent of controls for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (n = 5 per group). Differences between groups were statistically significant. Histologic analysis of Group 1 specimens revealed generalized atrophy of all muscle fibers. In Group 2, specimens showed evidence of reinnervation and less atrophy. Group 3 specimens demonstrated an atrophic pattern with islands of non-atrophic fibers scattered throughout. Sensory protection was thus shown to have significant effect on post-denervation atrophy in rat skeletal muscle.

TI  - Transplant therapy: recovery of function after spinal cord injury.  
AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in devastating loss of function and altered sensation. Presently, victims of SCI have few remedies for the loss of motor function and the altered sensation often experienced subsequent to the injury. A goal in SCI research is to improve function in both acute and chronic injuries. Among the most successful interventions is the utilization of transplanted tissues toward improved recovery. The theory is that the transplanted tissue could (1) bridge the spinal lesion and provide chemical and/or mechanical guidance for host neurons to grow across the lesion, (2) bridge the spinal lesion and provide additional cellular elements to repair the damaged circuitry, (3) provide factors that would rescue neurons that would otherwise die and/or modulate neural circuits to improve function. A variety of tissues and cells have been added to the adult mammalian spinal cord to encourage restoration of function. These include Schwann cells, motor neurons, dorsal root ganglia, adrenal tissue, hybridomas, peripheral nerves, and fetal spinal cord (FSC) tissue en bloc or as disassociated cells. It is postulated that these tissues would rescue or replace injured adult neurons, which would then integrate or promote the regeneration of the spinal cord circuitry and restore function. In some instances, host-appropriate circuitry is supplied by the transplant and functional improvement is demonstrated. In this presentation, specific examples of recent work with transplanted tissue and cells that demonstrate improved behavioral outcome are presented. New recent work describing the in vitro propagation and characterization of human fetal spinal cord multipotential progenitor cells are also described in the context of a potential resource for transplantable cells. Additionally, data from transplantation experiments of human FSC cells into nonimmunosuppressed rat spinal cord are described, and the resultant improvements in behavioral outcome reported. Lastly, directions for future SCI research are proposed.

TI  - Bilateral single ureteral ectopia: difficulty attaining continence using standard bladder neck repair.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We reviewed the surgical results of the management of bilateral single ureteral ectopia, a rare congenital cause of severe urinary incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 6 girls and 1 male infant who presented to 1 institution with this diagnosis in a 10-year period. RESULTS: All patients were incontinent and 3 had undergone ureteral reimplantation as an initial procedure with persistent postoperative wetting. Of the 5 patients who underwent a total of 8 attempts at increasing bladder outlet resistance, including 3 Young-Dees-Leadbetter, 2 Kropp, 1 Stamey, 1 Burch and 1 pubovaginal sling procedure, 2 also underwent simultaneous bladder augmentation to increase bladder capacity. However, none of these children had satisfactory continence after the continence procedure. Three of these patients who subsequently underwent appendicovesicostomy with bladder neck closure are continent. The 2 remaining patients underwent initial appendicovesicostomy with bladder neck closure and augmentation, and they are also continent. CONCLUSIONS: In our series total day and nighttime continence was only achieved by bladder neck closure, appendicovesicostomy and augmentation. Attempts at increasing bladder outlet resistance in patients with bilateral single ectopic ureters led to suboptimal rates of success even when adequate bladder capacity had been ensured by simultaneous augmentation.

TI  - Solitary giant skull base schwannomas--report of four cases.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solitary intracranial schwannomas not related to major nerves or neurofibromatosis as well as paranasal schwannomas are rare. Schwannomas simultaneously involving the paranasal sinuses and intracranial cavity are even rarer. METHODS: We report four cases of schwannomas simultaneously involving the intracranial cavity and paranasal sinuses. They were successfully managed by surgery. The literature on such tumors is reviewed. RESULTS: All patients were young adults; the male to female ratio was 1:3. In two patients, the tumor was predominantly intracranial with extension into the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses, whereas in the other patients, the tumor was located predominantly in the paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx with intracranial extension. Radiologically, bone destruction was seen in three cases. The tumors were totally removed piecemeal with repair of the basal dura. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma in all four cases. Three patients are alive and well; one of them was reoperated for a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: These tumors should be excised completely if possible. Radiologically, bone erosion or destruction are suggestive of malignancy but histopathology clinches the diagnosis. Therefore, drastic surgery should be avoided in these cases. Surgery is generally curative in these massive schwannomas.

TI  - Nonparametric estimation of the limiting availability.  
AB  - The point availability of a repairable system is the probability that the system is operating at a specified time. As time increases, the point availability converges to a positive constant called the limiting availability. Baxter and Li (1994a) developed a technique for constructing nonparametric confidence intervals for the point availability. However, nonparametric estimators of the limiting availability have not previously been studied in the literature. In this paper, we consider two separate cases: (1) the data are complete and (2) the data are subject to right censorship. For each case, a nonparametric confidence interval for the limiting availability is derived. Applications and simulation studies are presented.

TI  - Expression of wild-type p53 is required for efficient global genomic nucleotide excision repair in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts.  
AB  - We have shown previously that Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts homozygous for p53 mutations are deficient in the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from genomic DNA, but still proficient in the transcription-coupled repair pathway (Ford, J. M., and Hanawalt, P. C. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 8876-8880). We have now utilized monoclonal antibodies specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts, respectively, to measure their repair in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts. Cells homozygous for p53 mutations were deficient in the repair of both photoproducts, whereas cells heterozygous for mutant p53 exhibited normal repair of 6-4 photoproducts, but decreased initial rates of removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, compared with normal cells. The specificity of the effect of wild-type p53 on nucleotide excision repair was demonstrated in a p53 homozygous mutant cell line containing a tetracycline-regulated wild-type p53 gene. Wild-type p53 expression and activity were suppressed in the presence of tetracycline, whereas withdrawal of tetracycline resulted in the induction of p53 expression, cell cycle checkpoint activation, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The regulated expression of wild-type p53 resulted in the recovery of normal levels of repair of both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in genomic DNA, but did not alter the transcription-coupled repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Therefore, the wild-type p53 gene product is an important determinant of nucleotide excision repair activity in human cells.

TI  - Extending the concept of the autograft for complete repair of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: a report of ten cases of a modified procedure.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most cases of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, a Lecompte procedure (reparation a l'etage ventriculaire) is possible without interposition of a conduit between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. However, the anterior location of the pulmonary arteries after the Lecompte maneuver may be a potential cause for right ventricular outflow obstruction, which continues to be reported in 5% to 25% of cases. We have used a tubular segment of aortic autograft to connect the pulmonary artery, left in the orthotopic posterior position (without the Lecompte maneuver), to the right ventricle in 10 consecutive patients with transposition, ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients aged 2 months to 11 years (mean 32 months) have undergone a modified Lecompte operation. Eight had severe pulmonary stenosis, two had pulmonary atresia, and four had a restrictive ventricular septal defect at the time of the operation. Two had multiple ventricular septal defects. Seven had undergone one (n = 5) or two (n = 2) previous modified Blalock-Taussig shunts. All patients underwent a total correction with left ventricular-aortic intraventricular connection (four needed a ventricular septal defect enlargement), connection between the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries with a tubular segment of autograft aorta, without the Lecompte maneuver (anterior location of the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries) on the right (n = 6) or the left (n = 4) of the aorta. No valvular device was used for the right ventricular outflow repair. RESULTS: No early or late deaths occurred. One patient with multiple ventricular septal defects needed an early (2 weeks) reoperation for a residual muscular ventricular septal defect. All patients are currently in New York Heart. Association class I, without medications, in sinus rhythm, at a mean follow-up of 30 months. Late results up to 3.6 years show no calcification on the chest roentgenogram, and at the most recent echocardiogram, right ventricular pressures were low (25 to 40 mm Hg, mean 33 mm Hg) and no significant gradient (over 10 mm Hg) was found between the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries. Left and right ventricular function was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: This modification of the Lecompte operation using a segment of autograft allows an excellent early and late result, with no danger of compression of anteriorly placed pulmonary arteries, no significant right ventricular outflow obstruction, and normal appearance of the tubular autograft. In view of laboratory and clinical evidence, normal growth of the autograft can be anticipated. It allows an elective correction of transposition, ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction without a previous Blalock-Taussig shunt (three patients) and correction at a young age (three patients younger than 1 year).

TI  - The development and utility of a defined muscle and fat co-culture system.  
AB  - The utility of co-culture systems in defining the interactions between two different cell types has been well documented in the literature but is a relatively new tool for use in the study of cells derived from normal muscle tissue from meat animals. The majority of myonuclei in postnatal skeletal muscle cells (myofibers) result from satellite cell proliferation, differentiation and fusion with existing myofibers. As such, satellite cell culture systems that mimic postnatal myofibers have great potential for delineating the process of growth and repair of muscle mass. Other ways to simulate the environment of postnatal myofibers might include the development of co-culture systems using satellite cells, or satellite cell-derived myotubes, and other mesodermal cells commonly found associated with muscle tissue in vivo. This brief review describes our initial efforts to develop a defined satellite cell and preadipocyte co-culture system. We provide useful information about defined media requirements and requirements for proper cell orientation and growth on two different growth planes. We present summary data to suggest that differences were found between members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) families of polypeptides, when conditioned media samples were analyzed from co-cultures composed of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and satellite cells (with different propensities to undergo morphological fusion to form multinucleated myotubes). We also provide information about potential problems to avoid when initiating and conducting co-culture experiments. Such a co-culture system has application in the study of human obesity and also in the regulation of fat deposition in meat animals.

TI  - The DNA repair activity of human redox/repair protein APE/Ref-1 is inactivated by phosphorylation.  
AB  - The human DNA repair protein apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) is a dual-function protein that has important roles in both the repair of baseless sites that arise in DNA and in regulating the redox state of a number of proteins (Ref-1). Although previous attention has been focused on how the human APE/Ref-1 gene may be regulated at the DNA level, we have instead examined if APE/Ref-1 is phosphorylated, and if so how it may affect DNA repair activity. We demonstrate here that APE/Ref-1 is indeed a substrate for phosphorylation by the serine/threonine casein kinases (CK) I and II and protein kinase C. Notably, although phosphorylation by CKI and protein kinase C had no effect whatsoever on the ability of APE/Ref-1 to act at abasic sites in DNA, phosphorylation by CKII completely abolished DNA repair activity. That phosphorylation was responsible for the loss of abasic repair activity was concluded from experiments showing that inactive APE/Ref-1 could be reversed to an active DNA repair protein with phosphatase treatment. These results may help to explain the mechanism by which APE/Ref-1 switches from one unrelated function to another.

TI  - Double-strand break repair by Ku70 requires heterodimerization with Ku80 and DNA binding functions.  
AB  - Heterodimers of the 70 and 80 kDa Ku autoantigens (Ku70 and Ku80) activate the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Mutations in any of the three subunits of this protein kinase (Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs) lead to sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and to DNA double-strand breaks, and V(D)J recombination product formation defects. Here we show that the IR repair, DNA end binding and DNA-PK defects in Ku70-/- embryonic stem cells can be counteracted by introducing epitope-tagged wild-type Ku70 cDNA. Truncations and chimeras of Ku70 were used to identify the regions necessary for DNA end binding and IR repair. Site-specific mutational analysis revealed a core region of Ku70 responsible for DNA end binding and heterodimerization. The propensity for Ku70 to associate with Ku80 and to bind DNA correlates with the ability to activate DNA-PK, although two mutants showed that the roles of Ku70 in DNA-PK activation and IR repair are separate. Mutation of DNA-PK autophosphorylation sites and other structural motifs in Ku70 showed that these sites are not necessary for IR repair in vivo. These studies reveal Ku70 features required for double-strand break repair.

OBJECTIVE: We describe our experience with the staged retroauricular to auricular pedicle flap for repair of soft-tissue defects with exposed cartilage of the helix of the ear. METHODS: The staged pedicle flap was used to repair 26 helical ear defects after excision of basal cell carcinoma (n = 16), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), and melanoma (n = 7). RESULTS: Defect size ranged from 1 x 2 cm to 4 x 6 cm (average 2.4 x 3.3 cm). Defects involved the superior helix in 12 patients, mid helix in 11, and inferior helix in three. No cases of infection or flap necrosis occurred. CONCLUSION: The staged retroauricular to auricular pedicle flap consistently provides a good to excellent functional and cosmetic outcome when performed on properly selected helical ear defects.

TI  - Adverse effects of hyperhomocysteinemia and their management by folic acid.  
AB  - A moderate increase in plasma homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma homocysteine is frequently elevated in chronic renal failure and in uremic patients, and the major causes of death in these patients are cardiovascular accidents. Homocysteine metabolism and mechanisms of toxicity are reviewed. Homocysteine elevation in blood leads to the intracellular increase of its precursor, adenosylhomocysteine, a powerful inhibitor of adenosylmethionine-dependent transmethylations. In vitro evidence shows that this increase is reversible upon homocysteine removal. Membrane protein methylation levels are consistently reduced in erythrocytes of both chronic renal failure and hemodialysis patients. This widespread enzymatic methylation is a key step for the repair of molecular damage resulting from the spontaneous deamidation and isomerization reactions of susceptible residues in proteins. In agreement with these findings is the observation that the concentration of a stable side product, D-Asx, of the repair process is significantly lower in erythrocyte membrane proteins from hemodialysis patients than from controls, showing that the repair of damaged membrane proteins is actually defective. It has been shown that treatment with folates dramatically lowers plasma homocysteine, presumably by improving remethylation to methionine. This indicates that folates and/ or their active derivative, i.e., methyltetrahydrofolate, could be effective in ameliorating transmethylations as well.

TI  - [Inguinal hernia repair by the tension free technique of Lichtenstein]  
AB  - Failure rate in standard groin hernia repair varies from 3 to 10%. Polypropylene mesh implantation based on Lichtenstein "tension free" method in 1986 year reduced the failure rate to less than 1%. From Feb. '95 to Dec.'96, 115 patients were operated on with 127 groin hernias repair. The average age of patients was 58 years 52 direct hernias, 74 indirect hernias and 1 pantaloon hernia have been diagnosed in examined material, 101 primary repairs and 26 repairs of recurrent hernia have been performed. The operations were performed in subarachnoid anaesthesia--66 patients, in general anaesthesia--11 patients in local anaesthesia--38 patients. After having opened the inguinal canal estimated the type of its wall defect. In case of direct hernia the sac usually was invaginated by absorbing suture. In case of indirect hernia sac was cut and peritoneal cavity left opened. The patch made of polypropylene monofilament mesh (size 6 x 8 cm) was sewn with "tension free" method under spermatic funiculus. As a complication 6 patients had haematomas in operating wounds. Four of the patients had wound infections. One of these patients was operated again and the patch was removed. The patients had no recurrence of hernia during the previous 10.6 months of observation. We haven't confirmed recurrence in examined material, yet it was too short time to estimate the efficiency of repair. The proposed way of groin hernia repair is easy and simple in every-day surgery practice.

TI  - [Management of large abdominal wall hernias with foreign implant materials (Gore-Tex patch)]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Incisional hernia repair with conventional techniques (simple closure, Mayo) is associated with high recurrence rates in the range of 30-50%. Surgical repair using different prosthetic biomaterials gains more and more acceptance. Therefore we wanted to evaluate our own results of hernia repair and analyze the results of a mesh hernioplasty using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch (ePTFE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1. During the study period (1984-1992) a total of 205 hernia repairs (148 primary repairs, 57 repairs for recurrent hernia) were done in 173 patients at our institution using the following techniques: Mayo technique n = 90, simple one layer suture n = 56, absorbable mesh n = 25, ePTFE n = 17, other mesh techniques n = 17. In a retrospective study 135 of these patients (78%) could be examined clinically. The average follow up time was 44 months (10-105). 2. Since 1988 we used the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex Soft Tissue Patch) in selected cases for incisional hernia repair. In a second retrospective analysis the course of 26 patients, who were operated between 1988 and 1994, is reported. RESULTS: 1. Local wound complications occurred in 3-6% with conventional techniques and in 11-13% after different types of mesh repair (n.s.). Overall recurrence rates were 30% for primary hernia repair and 38% for recurrent hernia repair without statistically different rates for the various techniques. The presence of two or more patient dependent risk factors (obesity, obstructive lung disease etc.) (p < 0.05) and hernia diameter > 5 cm (p < 0.05) were identified as risk factors for hernia recurrency. 2. In the ePTFE group one patient (4%) developed a superficial wound complication, in another three patients (12%) the patch had to be removed due to deep wound infections. All three patients had revealed septic wound complications after previous surgery. The recurrence rates (17% for primary repair and 20% for repeated repair) were clearly lower compared to conventional techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prosthetic mesh should be considered for repair of large or recurrent incisional hernias, especially in high risk patients (obesity, obstructive lung disease). Beside the most often used polypropylene mesh, the ePTFE patch (Gore-tex-Soft-Tissue-Patch) represents a valuable alternative in selected cases with direct contact of the prosthesis to abdominal viscera. Any previous septic wound complication or a contaminated operating field (e.g. colostomy) seems to be a contraindication for its use.

TI  - What have mast cells to do with edema formation, the consecutive repair and fibrinolysis? [see comments]  
AB  - Mast cells (MC) have been implicated in the activation of vascular endothelial cells, capillary leak formation, transmigration of white blood cells, and translocation of fibrinogen (and other plasma molecules) into the tissues, with consecutive edema formation. However, the mechanisms of repair that lead to tissue reconstitution after MC activation and edema formation have not been defined so far. In the present article, the possible contribution of MC to repair, in particular fibrinolysis, is discussed. Thus, accumulating evidence exists that human MC express and release the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in a constitutive manner. MC also express the urokinase receptor (uPAR) and heparin. Most importantly, however, MC lack plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1, PAI-2, PAI-3). In line with this 'pro-fibrinolytic' profile of antigens, MC supernatants induce plasminogen-to-plasmin conversion and fibrin clot lysis in vitro. The c-kit ligand SCF upregulates uPAR expression, and the release of tPA from MC. These observations point to an important role of MC in endogenous fibrinolysis, a hitherto unrecognized (repair) function of this cell.

TI  - Heparin/heparan sulfate chelation inhibits control of vascular repair by tissue-engineered endothelial cells.  
AB  - The relative importance of heparin-like compounds in mediating vascular repair is unclear. We investigated how protamine, a chelator of heparin, affected endothelial cell inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell growth and intimal hyperplasia. The 52% (P < 0.001) reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation produced by postconfluent endothelial cell-conditioned medium was entirely reversed by pretreatment of medium with heparinase and heparitinase and was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the coadministration of protamine. Pretreatment of conditioned medium with heparinase and heparitinase largely prevented protamine's mitogenic activity, suggesting that protamine affects growth by interacting with heparin-like compounds. Perivascular implantation of polymerengrafted endothelial cells reduced neointima formation in denuded rat carotid arteries by 92% (P < 0.001) and cell proliferation by 81% (P < 0.001). Coadministration of protamine abolished the inhibitory potential of the cell implants, resulting in a nearly twofold exacerbation of intimal hyperplasia compared with controls (P < 0.001). Thus heparin-like molecules are essential to the biochemical regulation of vascular repair provided by endothelial cells, and the continued routine clinical use of heparin chelators, like protamine, may be questionable.

TI  - Early effectiveness of arthroscopic repair for full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff: an outcome analysis.  
AB  - Fifty consecutive patients completed standardized questionnaires regarding general health status as well as function of the shoulder before and an average of thirteen months after arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness tear of the rotator cuff. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative responses to the questions demonstrated highly significant improvements in the patient's assessment both of general health and of function of the shoulder. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey revealed significant improvements in the most recent follow-up scores compared with the preoperative scores with regard to physical functioning (p = 0.0001), role-physical (p = 0.0001), bodily pain (p = 0.0001), vitality (p = 0.0001), social functioning (p = 0.0001), role-emotional (p = 0.006), mental health (p = 0.0213), and physical component summary (p = 0.0001). The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score, the Constant Shoulder Score, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Index showed significant improvements in all postoperative total and component scores (p = 0.0001). Most importantly, all three shoulder-rating systems demonstrated significant improvements in the postoperative scores for pain and function (p = 0.0001). While a general health status instrument such as the SF-36 can document the impact of an orthopaedic condition on a patient as well as the results of treatment, a more complete representation of the patient's condition requires the use of region-specific self-assessment questionnaires and evaluation by a physician.

AB  - To determine differences in recommendations for convalescence after inguinal herniorrhaphy, a questionnaire was mailed to 294 general practitioners in the Copenhagen area. Sixty-two percent returned the questionnaire. After primary hernia repair a period of 1-12 weeks off work was recommended (mean 2.6, 4.1 and 7.8 weeks in patients with light, moderate or heavy work load, respectively).  After repair for recurrent hernia 1-24 weeks off work were recommended (mean 3.5, 5.4 and 8.3 weeks in patients with light, moderate or heavy work load, respectively). Restrictions in lifting (> 5 kg) were recommended for 1-16 weeks, mean 6.1 and 7.4 weeks after primary and recurrent repair, respectively. It is concluded that there is a need for propagation of new data regarding shortened convalescence after herniorrhaphy in order to maximise the advantages of new surgical and analgesic techniques.

TI  - [Randomized trial of three types of repair used in 324 consecutive operations of hernia. A study of the frequency of recurrence]  
AB  - In order to assess the recurrence-rate of the commonly used repairs of inguinal hernia: Bassini, McVay and Shouldice, 324 consecutive non-recurrence hernias were randomly allocated to one of those repairs. The age range 18-65 years. Ninety-six percent of the operations were carried out by the author. After a median observation-period of 32 months (range 5-75), ten recurrences had occurred, two Bassini, four McVay and four Shouldice, showing no significant differences in recurrence rate between the three types of repair. All recurrences were re-operated, five of them suffered a second recurrence. Other complications occurred in 36 patients (11%). With extensive training, low recurrence-rates can be achieved with any of the above-mentioned repairs. It is recommended that herniasurgery be centralised, and that other outcome-measures than recurrence be scrutinized as well.

TI  - Biologically effective doses in medium dose rate brachytherapy of cancer of the cervix.  
AB  - The amount of dose reduction on changing from low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy to medium dose rate (MDR) or high dose rate (HDR) afterloading has been the subject of much debate. The magnitude of reduction depends, together with other possible factors, on two radiobiological parameters: the alpha/beta ratio and the half-time of repair of the relevant tissues. In an attempt to extract these radiobiological parameters for the late rectal complications observed in our previously published clinical results four different schedules using MDR and one using LDR are analyzed. The percentage incidence of complications was a function of increasing biologically effective dose (BED), but would yield nonsense scattergrams if plotted against raw total dose. In addition, for three other published MDR series, three LDR series, and two HDR series, the incidence of rectal complications is plotted against BED to examine the predictive potential of using BED as the surrogate of total dose. Our own results were published in 1996, consisting of 102 patients treated at the LDR of 0.44 Gy/hr and 88 patients treated by four different schedules using an MDR of 1.6-1.7 Gy/hr. Follow-up is at least 3 years in all schedules. The linear quadratic formula including the "g" dose rate factor was used to analyze them, assuming exponential repair of the repairable beta term. First, multivariate and profile likelihood analyses were carried out to obtain estimates of alpha/beta and T1/2 for rectal late responding tissues. Then graphs of incidence of rectal complications vs. BED were constructed, assuming alpha/beta = 3 Gy and T1/2 = 1.5 hr, values which had not been contradicted by the multivariate analysis. Graphs were drawn both for "all grades including mild reactions" (grades 1 + 2 + 3) and for "serious" complications (grade 3 in our system). In addition, other published cervical brachytherapy series were reviewed, with calculation of their BEDs if not published by the authors. It was necessary to review and compare their grading systems, so that "mild and moderate" (grades 1 and 2) could be contrasted with "serious" (grades 3 and 4 or 5 in various systems). Comparisons were made with other published results, including three LDR, three MDR, and two HDR series spanning from 1982 to 1997. The BEDs at which the incidence of rectal complications rose above the arbitrary level of 10% were compared for all three ranges of dose rate. The multivariate analysis gave estimates of alpha/beta and T1/2 which were not significantly different from 3 Gy and 1.5 hr, respectively, so these values were used to compute the BEDs for the subsequent comparisons. It was found that the graphs of incidence of rectal complications for "all grades including mild" agreed rather better between all series than might have been expected, within a provisional (10%) threshold BED of range 100-123 Gy3 (60-74 Gy given as 2 Gy fractionated external beam or as LDR). The dose-response curves diverged above these values, as expected until common grading systems such as SOMA/ LENT become more widely used. For "serious" complications the 10% incidence occurred at a median BED of 140 Gy3 (84 Gy given as 2 Gy fractionated external beam or as LDR), range 124-155 Gy3. The use of BED (or extrapolated response dose), assuming alpha/beta = 3 Gy and T1/2 = 1.5 hr, instead of total dose, enabled incidence of late rectal complications in cervical brachytherapy with LDR, MDR, and HDR to be plotted in a reasonably consistent way. This does not mean that those parameter values have been definitively determined, but they appear to be provisional values that may be of use in comparing the expected effects of new schedules until better values are obtained from greater use of common grading systems.

TI  - Review article: In vitro models in inflammatory bowel disease research--a critical review.  
AB  - Research efforts in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been directed towards the epithelium as it has become clear that epithelial cells play a critical role in inflammatory response. Most research involving IBD employs in vitro techniques. In vitro epithelial cell studies have played and are continuing to play a major role in providing specific information relevant to IBD. Thus, such studies have provided irrefutable evidence that epithelial responses can be induced by microbes/microbial products and by immune activation. Culture experiments have provided insights into the effects of individual cytokines and other inflammatory mediators on epithelial pathophysiology, injury and repair, apoptosis, necrosis, and other processes that may be involved in IBD. Activated epithelial cells can participate in and even orchestrate immune responses, by stimulating T cells (and possibly others) and by producing cytokines that recruit specific inflammatory cells. Physiological regulation of epithelial tight junctions has been demonstrated by in vitro studies; the implication of this information for treating IBD is just beginning to be explored. It is becoming increasingly clear that epithelial processing and presentation of antigens is critical to the outcome of the immune response.

TI  - [Arthroscopic surgical measures in the shoulder joint]  
AB  - Arthroscopic and open surgery have to be combined for successful surgical therapy of the shoulder joint. A surgeon performing open surgery alone or just using arthroscopic measures cannot cover the full spectrum of modern shoulder surgery. Isolated diagnostic arthroscopy is rarely indicated. Far more common, diagnostic arthroscopy is combined with an operative procedure both to confirm preoperative assessment of pathology and to uncover associated lesions. The results of arthroscopic stabilization of chronic anterior post-traumatic dislocations fail to compare with the high success rates of open procedures. Better patient selection will probably be the key to improving results. In cases of acute traumatic first-time dislocation in young, highly athletic people, arthroscopic repair of the isolated Bankart-Perthes lesion offers the attractive advantage of anatomic reconstruction with minimal soft-tissue dissection. Further indications for arthroscopic measurements of pathologies of the glenohumeral joint are synovectomy in rheumatoid arthritis, capsulotomy in frozen shoulder and tenodesis for lesions of the long head of the biceps. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression according to Ellman is the procedure performed most often and most successfully in the shoulder joint and has overcome the classic Neer open acromioplasty. For smaller tears of the supraspinatus tendon, arthroscopic acromioplasty can be combined with an all arthroscopic suture repair or with mini-open repair. Larger tears of the rotator cuff are still the domain for open reconstructive procedures. In associated or isolated AC joint arthritis, an arthroscopic Mumford procedure can be performed. For chronic calcific tendinitis, isolated arthroscopic excision of the calcium deposit is of great value. Additionally, acromioplasty is needed for true mechanical obstruction of the subacromial space.

TI  - [Analysis of risk factors in patients operated for abdominal aortic aneurysm]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of the associated risk factors on the early results of elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been evaluated in a series of 270 consecutive patients. Clinical, hematological and instrumental data concerning cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic diseases have been collected for each patient, as well as the type and the results of the surgical procedure. METHODS: The graft was straight aortic in 82 cases (30.3%), aorto-bisiliac in 130 (48.1%) and aorto-bifemoral in 58 cases (21.6%); the 237 uneventful patients (87.8%) have been discharged 8 days after the operation (mean) and 24 (8.9%) underwent to coronary-aortic bypass graft (CABG) previously. RESULTS: Postoperative complications have been observed in 33 patients (12.2%): 24.3% pulmonary, 21.2% cardiac and 15.1% renal and among these 13 patients died (4.8% of the complete series and 39.4% of those with complications) because of pulmonary (38.4%), cardiac (30.7%) and renal causes (23.3%) mainly. Despite the complications occurred mainly in patients with associated risk factors, the multivariate analysis has shown that only the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) plays a fundamental role (p < 0.005). On the contrary, among the patients died not one single risk factor reached statistical significance, although the COPD was close (p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the need of a careful evaluation and treatment of associated diseases in patients undergoing elective repair for an AAA; namely a screening for asymptomatic coronary artery disease, since the CABG can significantly reduce morbility and mortality rates, and for COPD. In addition a more careful monitoring of patients with long clamping time could reduce the possible related renal complications. Up to now, since the surgical procedures is already standardized, the precise diagnosis and treatment of associated risk factors represent the winning strategy for the achievement of better results.

A cellular extract from the yeast S. cerevisiae was found to be capable of rejoining DNA DSBs. Breaks at the EcoRI site were rejoined by extracts from both wild-type and mutant strains to form circular plasmids with almost equal efficiency. However, the fidelity of rejoining was lower for the rad52Delta extract than for normal wild-type.

TI  - Evidence for independent mismatch repair processing on opposite sides of a double-strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Double-strand break (DSB) induced gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during meiosis and MAT switching is mediated primarily by mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA). We used nontandem ura3 duplications containing palindromic frameshift insertion mutations near an HO nuclease recognition site to test whether mismatch repair also mediates DSB-induced mitotic gene conversion at a non-MAT locus. Palindromic insertions included in hDNA are expected to produce a stem-loop mismatch, escape repair, and segregate to produce a sectored (Ura+/-) colony. If conversion occurs by gap repair, the insertion should be removed on both strands, and converted colonies will not be sectored. For both a 14-bp palindrome, and a 37-bp near-palindrome, approximately 75% of recombinant colonies were sectored, indicating that most DSB-induced mitotic gene conversion involves mismatch repair of hDNA. We also investigated mismatch repair of well-repaired markers flanking an unrepaired palindrome. As seen in previous studies, these additional markers increased loop repair (likely reflecting corepair). Among sectored products, few had additional segregating markers, indicating that the lack of repair at one marker is not associated with inefficient repair at nearby markers. Clear evidence was obtained for low levels of short tract mismatch repair. As seen with full gene conversions, donor alleles in sectored products were not altered. Markers on the same side of the DSB as the palindrome were involved in hDNA less often among sectored products than nonsectored products, but markers on the opposite side of the DSB showed similar hDNA involvement among both product classes. These results can be explained in terms of corepair, and they suggest that mismatch repair on opposite sides of a DSB involves distinct repair tracts.

TI  - Initial experience with the Nikkiso centrifugal pump during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Several centers use atriodistal bypass (ADB) as a protective adjunct against distal ischemia during extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. Most current ADB circuits use indirect-drive centrifugal pumps. The purpose of this report is to describe our initial clinical experience with the Nikkiso pump, a more compact direct-drive centrifugal pump recently developed at Baylor, for ADB during TAAA repair. METHODS: The Nikkiso pump was used for ADB perfusion in 10 consecutive patients during graft repair of TAAAs (six Crawford extent I and four extent II). Two patients had aortic dissection. In the four patients who had extent II repairs, selective renal and visceral perfusion was also performed with the Nikkiso pump. RESULTS: No mechanical pump malfunctions or adverse events related to the device occurred. All 10 patients survived and were discharged from the hospital. No patient had paraplegia after surgery. Two patients had delayed lower extremity weakness after undergoing extent I repairs; both recovered and were ambulating at the time of discharge. No complications were associated with bleeding or cerebral, respiratory, renal, or hepatic function. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with the Nikkiso centrifugal pump during TAAA repair demonstrated excellent pump function that provided sufficient flow for both distal aortic and selective organ perfusion. The prevention of permanent spinal cord injury and distal organ failure was successful in this group.

TI  - Repair of hair bundles in sea anemones by secreted proteins.  
AB  - Sea anemones are sessile invertebrates that detect movements of prey using numerous hair bundles located on tentacles surrounding their mouth. Previously we found that hair bundles of anemones are structurally and functionally similar to those of vertebrates. After 10-15 min exposure to calcium depleted buffers, hair bundles in chickens suffer moderate damage from which they recover in 12 h without requiring new protein synthesis [Zhao, Yamoah and Gillespie, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1996) 15469-15474]. We find that after 1 h exposure to calcium free seawater, hair bundles of anemones suffer extensive damage from which they recover in 4 h, apparently because of newly synthesized, secretory proteins called 'repair proteins'. Recovery is delayed in a dose dependent fashion by cycloheximide. In the presence of exogenously added repair proteins, recovery occurs within 8 min and is cycloheximide insensitive. Recovery is ascertained by a bioassay performed on intact specimens, by electrophysiology, and by timelapse video microscopy. Fraction beta, a chromatographic fraction with bioactivity comparable to the complete mixture of repair proteins, consists of complexes having an estimated mass of 2000 kDa. Avidin based cytochemistry suggests that biotinylated fraction beta binds to damaged hair bundles. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis demonstrates that fraction beta contains 8-10 polypeptides of 90 kDa or smaller. At least four of these polypeptides apparently are consumed during the repair process. Negatively stained samples of fraction beta are shown by transmission electron microscopy to include filamentous structures similar in length (150 nm) and width (6 nm) to linkages between stereocilia. The filamentous structures can be associated with globular structures (20 nm in diameter). A model is presented wherein repair proteins comprise replacement linkages and enzymes that attach linkages to appropriate membrane proteins.

TI  - The manipulated mesenchymal stem cells in regenerated skeletal tissues.  
AB  - Ample experimental examples have been accumulated during the last 3 decades indicating the ability of exogenous sources of cultured cells to serve as implants accelerating cartilage regeneration in defects of articular surfaces. In some cases, the repair tissues form complete spatial reconstruction of the defect. In other cases, either the spatial reconstruction is incomplete or the quality of the reparative tissue is inadequate. A delayed pace of endochondral ossification in the deep zones of the subchondral region of the defects, or ossification above the tide mark, within the superficial cartilaginous articular regions have been noted. Therefore, even in this promising approach of biological resurfacing procedure results are not certain, and further investigative research efforts are required. In the current study, a comparison of implantations of various cultured cells of four different sources were tested in an avian system. The reparative tissue outcomes are divided into three grades: full regeneration success, partial success, and failure of regeneration according to qualitative histological parameters and quantitative observation of the gross specimen. Defects that failed to regenerate a completely filled lesion were found to contain cells carrying the preskeletal-precartilaginous characteristic marker of FGFR3. The findings based on the above parameters suggest that autogeneic, chondrocytic-enriched bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells are superior to other cell sources for articular cartilage regeneration. Grafting of defects with these cells results in a 100% success rate. Allogeneic limb bud-derived mesenchymal cells and allogeneic embryonal chondrocytes have both reached a success of 75% of completely filled defects. Allogeneic chondrocytic-enriched bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells yielded a 31% success rate. Untreated defects completely failed to heal. In successfully healed defects no cells of the reparative tissue carry the FGFR3 marker 3 months postimplantation. In partially healed defects, FGFR3 positive staining is present in fibrous cells at the invaginated surface. These latest findings may suggest some kind of proliferation failure in such cases.

TI  - Monosomy 22q11 in patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the morphology of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries with and without monosomy 22q11. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of all patients with this congenital heart defect who are being followed at the University Children's Hospital Erlangen. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre for paediatric cardiology and paediatric cardiac surgery. PATIENTS: 21 patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Monosomy 22q11 was diagnosed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation using the D22S75 probe (Oncor). The morphology of the pulmonary arteries was assessed on the basis of selective angiograms. RESULTS: 10 patients (48%) were shown to have a microdeletion in 22q11 (group I). There was no difference with respect to the presence of confluent central pulmonary arteries between these patients (80%) and the remaining 11 patients (group II) without monosomy 22q11 (91%). Patients of group I, however, more often had arborisation anomalies of the pulmonary vascular bed (90% in group I v 27% in group II). Because of the more severe abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries, a biventricular repair had not been possible in any of the children with monosomy 22q11, though repair had been carried out in 64% of the children in group II. CONCLUSION: The developmental disturbance caused by the monosomy 22q11 seems to impair the connection of the peripheral pulmonary artery segments to the central pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, resulting in a lower probability of biventricular repair.

TI  - Differential myogenicity of satellite cells isolated from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus rat muscles revealed in vitro.  
AB  - Following muscle damage, fast- and slow-contracting fibers regenerate, owing to the activation of their satellite cells. In rats, crush-induced regeneration of extensor digitorum longus (EDL, a fast muscle) and soleus (a slow muscle) present different characteristics, suggesting that intrinsic differences exist among their satellite cells. An in vitro comparative study of the proliferation and differentiation capacities of satellite cells isolated from these muscles is presented there. We observed several differences between soleus and EDL satellite cell cultures plated at high density on gelatin-coated dishes. Soleus satellite cells proliferated more actively and fused into myotubes less efficiently than EDL cells. The rate of muscular creatine kinase enzyme appeared slightly lower in soleus than in EDL cultures at day 11 after plating, when many myotubes were formed, although the levels of muscular creatine kinase mRNA were similar in both cultures. In addition, soleus cultures expressed higher levels of MyoD and myogenin mRNA and of MyoD protein than EDL satellite cell cultures at day 12. A clonal analysis was also carried out on both cell populations in order to determine if distinct lineage features could be detected among satellite cells derived from EDL and soleus muscles. When plated on gelatin at clonal density, cells from both muscles yielded clones within 2 weeks, which stemmed from 3-15 mitotic cycles and were classified into three classes according to their sizes. Myotubes resulting from spontaneous fusion of cells from the progeny of one single cell were seen regardless of the clone size in the standard culture medium we used. The proportion of clones showing myotubes in each class depended on the muscle origin of the cells and was greater in EDL- than in soleus-cell cultures. In addition, soleus cells were shown to improve their differentiation capacity upon changes in the culture condition. Indeed, the proportions of clones showing myotubes, or of cells fusing into myotubes in clones, were increased by treatments with a myotube-conditioned medium, with phorbol ester, and by growth on extra-cellular matrix components (Matrigel). These results, showing differences among satellite cells from fast and slow muscles, might be of importance to muscle repair after trauma and in pathological situations.

TI  - Changing practice patterns for children with heart disease: a clinical pathway approach.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric cardiac care is costly and requires extensive resources. We studied the effect of clinical pathways on practice patterns and patient care outcomes in infants and children hospitalized for cardiac surgery. METHODS: In consecutive patients admitted for selected cardiac surgical procedures before (n = 69) and after (n = 173) implementation of clinical pathways, outcomes including hospital length of stay, days in the ICU, time to extubation, ordering of blood studies, costs, and readmissions were compared. Data were analyzed for each of five cardiac surgical procedures: repair of an atrial septal defect, repair of a ventricular septal defect, division of a patent ductus arteriosus, repair of tetralogy of Fallot, and neonatal arterial switch operation to correct transposition of the great arteries. RESULTS: A significant reduction in length of hospital stay, including days in the ICU (decreased 1 to 2 days per admission), was achieved after the clinical pathway was implemented. Reductions in average duration of mechanical ventilation ranged from 28% for repair of a ventricular septal defect to 63% for repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The number of blood studies ordered decreased 20% to 30%. A significant reduction in hospital costs for each procedure, ranging from 16% to 29%, was also achieved with no adverse effects on patients' outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Use of clinical pathways with children hospitalized for cardiac surgery can shorten length of stay in the hospital, reduce use of resources, and improve cost-effectiveness with beneficial outcomes for patients.

TI  -  Repair of Descemet's membrane detachment with perfluoropropane (C3F8) [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the use of perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas in the repair of Descemet's membrane detachments. METHODS: Descemet's membrane detachments after cataract surgery in three eyes and pars plana vitrectomy in a fourth underwent anterior-chamber gas-exchange descemetopexy with an isoexpansile 14% mixture of C3F8 to facilitate reattachment of Descemet's membrane. RESULTS: Descemet's membrane detachment was successfully reattached after anterior-chamber gas exchange with 14% C3F8 in three of the four eyes treated. The fourth eye treated with 14% C3F8 probably failed Descemet's membrane reattachment because of an unrecognized viscoelastic bleb situated anterior to Descemet's membrane. No corneal decompensation or fluctuations in intraocular pressure were believed to be attributable to isoexpansile C3F8 gas exchange. CONCLUSION: Early recognition and repair of Descemet's membrane detachments may prevent complications, such as corneal decompensation, corneal opacities and edema, and an overall decline in visual acuity. Isoexpansile C3F8 is demonstrated as a safe and efficacious alternative for the repair of Descemet's membrane detachment.

TI  - Binding of basic fibroblast growth factor to fibrinogen and fibrin.  
AB  - Fibrin is formed at sites of tissue injury and provides the temporary matrix needed to support the initial endothelial cell responses needed for vessel repair. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) also acts at sites of injury and stimulates similar vascular cell responses. We have, therefore, investigated whether there are specific interactions between bFGF and fibrinogen and fibrin that could play a role in coordinating these actions. Binding studies were performed using bFGF immobilized on Sepharose beads and soluble 125I-labeled fibrinogen and also using Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen and soluble 125I-bFGF. Both systems demonstrated specific and saturable binding. Scatchard analysis indicated two classes of binding sites for each with Kd values of 1.3 and 260 nM using immobilized bFGF; and Kd values of 0.9 and 70 nM using immobilized fibrinogen. After conversion of Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen to fibrin by treatment with thrombin, bFGF also demonstrated specific and saturable binding with two classes of binding sites having Kd values of 0.13 and 83 nM. Fibrin binding was also investigated by clotting a solution of bFGF and fibrinogen, and two classes of binding sites were demonstrated using this system with Kd values of 0.8 and 261 nM. The maximum molar binding ratios of bFGF to fibrinogen were between 2.0 and 4.0 with the four binding systems. We conclude that bFGF binds specifically and saturably to fibrinogen and fibrin with high affinity, and this may have implications regarding the localization of its effect at sites of tissue injury.

TI  - The impact of multiple organ dysfunction on mortality following ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  
AB  - The in-hospital mortality for a patient with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA) ranges from 30% to 70% and remains unchanged despite aggressive surgical, anesthetic, and intensive-care management. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the relationship between the development of organ dysfunction and mortality in ruptured AAA patients. Eighty-eight consecutive patients admitted to the Toronto Hospital for repair of RAAAs were studied. APACHE II and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) scores were calculated for all patients. The MOD scoring system measures daily alterations in the function of six key organs, with increased dysfunction indicated by an increasing score. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 40%; 10% of patient deaths occurred intraoperatively. ICU mortality was bimodal; 11.5% deaths occurred within the first 48 hours compared to 18.2% after 48 hours (late deaths). The APACHE II score was significantly higher in those who died within 48 hours of ICU admission (28.5 +/- 6.36) compared to both those who died late (17.2 +/- 5.7, p < 0.0001) and survivors (11.2 +/- 4.2, p < 0.0001). The survivors' daily mean MOD scores did not increase significantly, while the MOD scores for late deaths increased progressively (p < 0.01). The renal and hepatic dysfunction components of the MOD score were significantly lower in the survivors compared to late deaths (p < 0.001), however the respiratory MOD score did not differ between the groups (p > 0.05). The change in MOD (delta MOD) score over the intensive care stay was significantly greater in late deaths compared to survivors (p < 0.01). The rates of infection were similar in both groups and were not responsible for mortality. We conclude that mortality is better predicted following RAAA by the development of renal and hepatic dysfunction rather than by initial physiologic derangement measured by the APACHE II score.

TI  - Role of oxidative DNA damage in cancer initiation and promotion.  
AB  - Normal aerobic metabolism produces huge amounts of potentially dangerous oxidants, controlled by a variety of antioxidant systems. An imbalance between the generated and exogenously inflicted oxidants and the oxidant system is termed oxidative stress. Even without oxidative stress, i.e. under normal physiological conditions, the damage to vital cellular micromolecules, such as DNA, is extensive, amounting to hundreds of hits per cell per day. More than one hundred different oxidative modifications in DNA have been described. The hydroxylation of guanine in the 8-position is the most frequent and most mutagenic lesion described. The 8-hydroxylation of guanine leads to lack of base pairing specifically and misreading of the modified base and adjacent residues. The modifications to DNA are so frequent that extensive and specific repair is needed for survival. Indeed, multiple repair enzyme systems to mediate and remove/repair oxidative DNA modification are described. Within DNA, hot-spots of oxidative modification and subsequent mutation have been described, and some specificity appears as compared to other agents that can lead to modification of DNA, i.e. aflatoxin and benzo[a]pyrene. Numerous publications from epidemiology and intervention studies with antioxidants point at oxidative modification as an important factor in cancer development at certain sites. Yet, direct evidence linking oxidative DNA modification to cancer has not been published. With regard to antoxidant prevention of cancer no effective single substance has so far been identified.

TI  - The inflammatory response to open tension-free inguinal hernioplasty versus conventional repairs.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The tension-free inguinal hernioplasty is now a popular method because of less postoperative disability and low recurrence rate. The laboratory evaluation of the inflammatory response to the injury is an objective approach to determine the stress status of a surgical procedure. The aim of this study is to evaluate and to compare inflammatory responses to open tension-free and conventional repairs of inguinal hernias. METHODS: Forty-eight male patients with primary indirect inguinal hernias were treated with elective operations, and separated into three groups according to surgical procedure: 12 pediatric patients treated with dissection of hernia sac in group 1, 16 adult patients with open tension-free hernioplasty in group 2, and 20 adult patients with conventional repairs in group 3. Ten healthy adult volunteers formed group 4 as control. The repair was performed with polypropylene mesh and suture as the Lichtenstein technique in group 2, and with polypropylene suture as one of Bassini, McVay, or Shouldice techniques in group 3. The inflammatory response was evaluated with serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels at 12 hours and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at 48 hours postoperatively. Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were measured in group 4 as control. Patient characteristics, operating time, and IL-6 and CRP levels were compared among the four groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean age and operating time between the two groups of adult patients with hernia repair. Mean serum IL-6 levels of 12.1 +/- 5.2 and 8.2 +/- 2.7 pg/mL, and CRP levels of 34.3 +/- 13.8 and 7.5 +/- 4 mg/L in pediatric and control groups, respectively, were significantly lower than in the other two hernia groups. Mean serum IL-6 levels were 58.9 +/- 25.4 pg/mL in group 2 (tension-free repair) and 44.3 +/- 18.1 pg/mL in group 3 (conventional repair) (P > 0.05). Mean serum CRP levels were 111.3 +/- 41.3 and 83 +/- 43.2 mg/L in groups 2 and 3, respectively (P > 0.05). The differences not being statistically significant, a similar and considerable inflammatory response was noted in patients with either prosthetic mesh repair or with conventional repairs of indirect inguinal hernias. CONCLUSIONS: The reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal induces significant cytokine response regardless of tension-free or conventional repair. Open tension-free hernioplasty offered no advantages over conventional repairs from the standpoint of the inflammatory and acute phase response.

TI  - The effects of multiple-strand suture methods on the strength and excursion of repaired intrasynovial flexor tendons: a biomechanical study in dogs.  
AB  - This study was designed to determine the effects of in vivo multistrand, multigrasp suture techniques on the strength and gliding of repaired intrasynovial tendons when controlled passive motion rehabilitation was used. Twenty-four adult mongrel dogs were divided into 4 groups and their medial and lateral forepaw flexor tendons were transsected and sutured by either the Savage, the Tajima, the Kessler, or the recently developed 8-strand suture method. The tendon excursion, joint rotation, and tensile properties of the repaired tendons were evaluated biomechanically at 3 and 6 weeks after surgery. It was found that neither time nor suture method significantly effected proximal and distal interphalangeal joint rotation or tendon excursion when the 4 techniques were compared to each other. Normalized load value (experimental/control) was significantly affected by both the suture method and the amount of time after surgery, however. The Savage and 8-strand repair methods had significantly greater strength than did the Tajima method at each time interval (p < .05 for each comparison). In addition, the 8-strand method had significantly greater normalized load values than did the Savage method at each time interval (p < .05 for each comparison). Normalized stiffness (experimental/control) for the 8-strand repair method was significantly greater than that for the Tajima and Savage methods at 3 and 6 weeks after surgery (p < .05). In addition, the normalized stiffness values for the 6-week groups was significantly greater than those for the 3-week groups (p < .05). It was concluded that the method of tendon suture was a significant variable insofar as the regaining of tendon strength was concerned and that the newer low-profile 8-strand repair method significantly expands the safety zone for the application of increased in vivo load during the early stages of rehabilitation.

TI  - [Bile duct lesions in laparoscopic cholecystectomy--methods of reconstruction and results]  
AB  - From 1/1991 to 1/1997 a total of 18 patients with major biliary lesions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated. Besides 4 biliary strictures (Bismuth III, Siewert II), which were found between 20 and 180 days after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, large defects (Siewert III, IV) of the proximal parts of the hepatic duct (Bismuth III, IV) occurred in the majority of cases (n = 14). Except for 3 intraoperatively realized lesions, diagnosis was made during the first 3 weeks. Subsequent reinterventions resulted in a high morbidity rate and the need of further procedures to establish definitive biliary reconstruction. Selection criteria of the technique used for repair were the extension of the biliary lesion and the exposure of the distal stump of the common bile duct. A small defect was treated by direct suturing protected by a t-tube (n = 1). Large defects and biliary strictures were reconstructed using either a Roux-en-Y bilio-digestive anastomosis (n = 7) or jejunal interposition (n = 10). The results suggest, that early repair of biliary lesions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be achieved. Besides the standard procedure of bilio-digestive anastomosis, reconstruction of major biliary lesions should be performed by jejunal interposition in selected cases.

TI  - Esmolol for the management of pediatric hypertension after cardiac operations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension frequently occurs during the immediate postoperative period in children after repair of aortic coarctation but may also occur after repair of other congenital heart defects. Nitroprusside has often been used to control blood pressure in this setting. Because hypertension after coarctation repair is frequently associated with elevations in catecholamines, esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocking agent, may be an effective alternative. Therefore we undertook the first systematic investigation to determine the efficacy and disposition of esmolol in pediatric patients with acute hypertension after cardiac operations. METHODS: Twenty patients aged 1 month to 12 years (median 25.6 months) with acute hypertension after cardiac operations received esmolol in an opened-labeled trial. Esmolol was titrated to a blood pressure less than or equal to the 90th percentile for age. RESULTS: Ten patients had coarctation repair and the remaining patients underwent repair of other congenital heart defects. On final esmolol dose (mean +/- standard deviation dosage 700 +/- 232 microg/kg/min) there was a significant percent decrease in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures from postoperative values. Esmolol dose was significantly associated with percent reduction in systolic blood pressure. Final esmolol dose and total body clearance were significantly higher in patients after coarctation repair. There were significant associations between esmolol dose and esmolol blood concentrations at steady state. CONCLUSIONS: The dosage required to control hypertension in patients after repair of aortic coarctation was higher than patients who underwent repair of other congenital heart defects. Esmolol was effective in controlling blood pressure in 19 of 20 patients without adverse effects.

TI  - Wortmannin inhibits repair of DNA double-strand breaks in irradiated normal human cells.  
AB  - Wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, was recently found to be an effective radiosensitizer in cells of various human and murine cell lines. Another study indicated that wortmannin inhibited repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in irradiated Chinese hamster ovary cells using the neutral elution assay. To further clarify the mechanism behind radiosensitization by wortmannin, we have studied DSB repair in gamma-irradiated normal human fibroblasts using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The rejoining of DSBs in irradiated cells was significantly inhibited when 20 microM or more of wortmannin was added to the cells. The colony formation assay in cultures treated with wortmannin showed that the radiosensitization occurred in a manner that was dependent on the drug concentration. However, significant sensitization was observed only with a concentration of wortmannin of 20 microM or higher, reflecting the results of DSB rejoining studies. No marked reduction in plating efficiencies was observed for cells treated with wortmannin alone. The studies of the levels of expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) indicated that, while there were no significant changes in expression of Ku protein, the expression of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) was reduced markedly in cultures treated with wortmannin using an antibody against the C-terminus region of DNA-PKcs. In addition, no reduction in the levels of expression of DNA-PKcs was observed in cells treated with wortmannin using an antibody which recognizes a mid-region of this large protein. These results together with those of related studies suggest that wortmannin radiosensitizes normal human cells by inhibiting DSB repair and that this inhibition is a consequence of an inactivation of kinase activity and/or a structural change caused by binding of wortmannin to the C-terminus region of DNA-PKcs.

TI  - Potentiation of chlorambucil cytotoxicity in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia by inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase activity using wortmannin.  
AB  - In this study, we examined the ability of wortmannin to modulate chlorambucil (CLB) cytotoxicity in lymphocyte samples from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). It has been suggested previously that enhanced cross-link repair is a primary mechanism of resistance to nitrogen mustards (NMs) in B-CLL. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks and in rejoining steps in recombination mechanisms. Mutants defective in this process are hypersensitive to alkylating agents. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of DNA-PK is a determinant in the cellular response of B-CLL to CLB. The DNA-PK gene has homology to the P110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Wortmannin, an inhibitor of P110 PI 3-K, also inhibits DNA-PK activity in vitro. We investigated the effect of wortmannin on DNA-PK activity and CLB toxicity in the lymphocytes from 11 patients with B-CLL. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PK activity is decreased after exposure to wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin, at nontoxic concentrations, synergistically sensitized B-CLL lymphocytes to the effects of CLB. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation when we compared the fold decrease in DNA-PK activity and the synergistic value (I), obtained when wortmannin was used at 0.1 microM. In the resistant B-CLL lymphocyte samples, there was a highly significant correlation between the ability of wortmannin at 0.1 and 0.25 microM to decrease the level of DNA-PK activity and to increase CLB sensitivity. In a model of primary human tumor cells, our findings suggest that the inhibition of DNA-PK activity may be a powerful way to overcome resistance to NMs such as CLB and point to new possibilities to improve the effectiveness of NM therapy.

TI  - Biological monitoring of young workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in engine repair workshops.  
AB  - Several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are carcinogenic in rodents, while exposure to these compounds has been associated with various types of human cancer. Engine exhaust and used engine oils are major PAH sources in engine repair workshops. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) levels and some genotoxicity parameters (sister-chromatid exchange, SCE; micronucleus, MN) have been compared among engine repair workers (n = 61, age: between 13 and 18) and workers not occupationally exposed to PAH (n = 30, age: between 13 and 19). The mean value (+/- S.E.) of urinary 1-OHP excretions of workers was 4.71 +/- 0.53 micromol/mol creatinine and also mean urinary 1-OHP for controls was found to be as 1.55 +/- 0.28 micromol/mol creatinine. The mean values (+/- S.E.) of SCE frequency per cell in peripheral lymphocytes from the workers and controls were 4.47 +/- 0.09 and 4.06 +/- 0.16, respectively (p < 0.05). The mean (+/- S.E.) MN (per thousand) frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes from the workers and controls were 1.87 +/- 0.04 and 1.56 +/- 0.06, respectively (p < 0.0001). The effect of smoking for the above parameters were also evaluated.

TI  - Efficient in vitro repair of 7-hydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine by human cell extracts: involvement of multiple pathways.  
AB  - To investigate the repair of oxidative damage in DNA, we have established an in vitro assay utilizing human lymphoblastoid whole cell extracts and plasmid DNA damaged by exposure to methylene blue and visible light. This treatment has been shown to produce predominantly 7-hydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in double-stranded DNA at low levels of modification. DNA containing 1. 6 lesions per plasmid is substrate for efficient repair synthesis by cell extracts. The incorporation of dGMP is 2.7 +/- 0.5 times greater than the incorporation of dCMP, indicating an average repair patch of 3-4 nucleotides. Damage-specific nicking occurs within 15 min, while resynthesis is slower. The incorporation of dGMP increases linearly, while the incorporation of dCMP exhibits a distinct lag. Extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation groups A and B exhibit 25 and 40%, respectively, of the incorporation of dCMP compared with normal extracts, but extracts from an XP-D cell line exhibit twice the activity. These data suggest that the efficient repair of 8-oxodG lesions observed in human cell extracts involves more than one pathway of base excision repair.

TI  - Ku80 is required for immunoglobulin isotype switching.  
AB  - Isotype switching is the DNA recombination mechanism by which antibody genes diversify immunoglobulin effector functions. In contrast to V(D)J recombination, which is mediated by RAG1, RAG2 and DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair proteins, little is known about the mechanism of switching. We have investigated the role of DNA DSB repair in switch recombination in mice that are unable to repair DSBs due to a deficiency in Ku80 (Ku80(-/-)). B-cell development is arrested at the pro-B cell stage in Ku80(-/-) mice because of abnormalities in V(D)J recombination, and there are no mature B cells. To reconstitute the B-cell compartment in Ku80(-/-) mice, pre-rearranged VB1-8 DJH2 (mu i) and V3-83JK2 (kappa i) genes were introduced into the Ku80(-/-) background (Ku80(-/-)mu i/+kappa i/+). Ku80(-/-)mu i/+ kappai/+ mice develop mature mIgM+ B cells that respond normally to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS plus interleukin-4 (IL-4) by producing specific germline Ig constant region transcripts and by forming switch region-specific DSBs. However, Ku80(-/-)mu i/+kappa i/+ B cells are unable to produce immunoglobulins of secondary isotypes, and fail to complete switch recombination. Thus, Ku80 is essential for switch recombination in vivo, suggesting a significant overlap between the molecular machinery that mediates DNA DSB repair, V(D)J recombination and isotype switching.

TI  - Pain following human brachial plexus injury with spinal cord root avulsion and the effect of surgery.  
AB  - Brachial plexus injury leading to spinal cord root avulsion in humans produces a characteristic constant crushing and intermittent shooting pain, which is often intractable. Preliminary observations suggested that this pain might be alleviated after successful nerve transfers to restore limb function. We therefore studied a group of 14 patients prospectively, to establish the validity of this observation, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We found a strong correlation and temporal relationship between reduction in pain and successful nerve repair. All five patients with motor recovery experienced significant relief of de-afferentation pain, while in the seven patients with persistent pain, none had motor recovery. There was no correlation between pain relief and the minimal recovery of sensation in some cases, and no case had any return of sensory or sympathetic cutaneous axon-reflexes. While skin sympathetic axon-reflexes were reduced with T1 root lesions, there was no relationship between T1 root damage and pain. It was concluded that nerve repair can reduce pain from spinal root avulsions and that the mechanism may involve successful regeneration, and/or restoration of peripheral connections prior to their function, possibly in muscle.

TI  - MMS2, encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating-enzyme-like protein, is a member of the yeast error-free postreplication repair pathway.  
AB  - Among the three Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA repair epistasis groups, the RAD6 group is the most complicated and least characterized, primarily because it consists of two separate repair pathways: an error-free postreplication repair pathway, and a mutagenesis pathway. The rad6 and rad18 mutants are defective in both pathways, and the rev3 mutant affects only the mutagenesis pathway, but a yeast gene that is involved only in error-free postreplication repair has not been reported. We cloned the MMS2 gene from a yeast genomic library by functional complementation of the mms2-1 mutant [Prakash, L. & Prakash, S. (1977) Genetics 86, 33-55]. MMS2 encodes a 137-amino acid, 15.2-kDa protein with significant sequence homology to a conserved family of ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) proteins. However, Mms2 does not appear to possess Ubc activity. Genetic analyses indicate that the mms2 mutation is hypostatic to rad6 and rad18 but is synergistic with the rev3 mutation, and the mms2 mutant is proficient in UV-induced mutagenesis. These phenotypes are reminiscent of a pol30-46 mutant known to be impaired in postreplication repair. The mms2 mutant also displayed a REV3-dependent mutator phenotype, strongly suggesting that the MMS2 gene functions in the error-free postreplication repair pathway, parallel to the REV3 mutagenesis pathway. Furthermore, with respect to UV sensitivity, mms2 was found to be hypostatic to the rad6Delta1-9 mutation, which results in the absence of the first nine amino acids of Rad6. On the basis of these collective results, we propose that the mms2 null mutation and two other allele-specific mutations, rad6Delta1-9 and pol30-46, define the error-free mode of DNA postreplication repair, and that these mutations may enhance both spontaneous and DNA damage-induced mutagenesis.

TI  - Nitrogen mustard up-regulates Bcl-2 and GSH and increases NTP and PCr in HT-29 colon cancer cells.  
AB  - We hypothesized that unexplained increases in nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) observed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) after treatment of tumours by DNA-damaging agents were related to chemotherapy-induced up-regulation of the bcl-2 gene and DNA damage prevention and repair processes. To test this hypothesis, we treated HT-29 cells with 10(-4) M nitrogen mustard (HN2) and performed sequential perchloric acid extractions in replicate over 0-18 h. By reference to an internal standard (methylene diphosphonic acid), absolute changes in 31P-detectable high-energy phosphates in these extracts were determined and correlated with changes in bcl-2 protein levels, cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and total cellular glutathione (GSH) (an important defence against DNA damage from alkylating agents). After HN2 administration, bcl-2 protein levels in the HT-29 cell line rose at 2 h. Cell viability declined to 25% within 18 h, but apoptosis measured using fluorescence techniques remained in the 1-4% range. Increased cell division was noted at 4 h. Two high-energy interconvertible phosphates, NTP (P < or = 0.006) and phosphocreatine (PCr) (P < or = 0.0002), increased at 2 h concurrently with increased levels of bcl-2 protein and glutathione. This study demonstrates that bcl-2 and glutathione are up-regulated by HN2 and links this to a previously unexplained 31P MRS phenomenon: increased NTP after chemotherapy.

TI  - Single-strand DNA-specific exonucleases in Escherichia coli. Roles in repair and mutation avoidance.  
AB  - Mutations in the genes encoding single-strand DNA-specific exonucleases (ssExos) of Escherichia coli were examined for effects on mutation avoidance, UV repair, and conjugational recombination. Our results indicate complex and partially redundant roles for ssExos in these processes. Although biochemical experiments have implicated RecJ exonuclease, Exonuclease I (ExoI), and Exonuclease VII (ExoVII) in the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway, the RecJ- ExoI- ExoVII- mutant did not exhibit a mutator phenotype in several assays for base substitution mutations. If these exonucleases do participate in mismatch excision, other exonucleases in E. coli can compensate for their loss. Frameshift mutations, however, were stimulated in the RecJ- ExoI- ExoVII- mutant. For acridine-induced frameshifts, this mutator effect was due to a synergistic effect of ExoI- and ExoVII- mutations, implicating both ExoI and ExoVII in avoidance of frameshift mutations. Although no single exonuclease mutant was especially sensitive to UV irradiation, the RecJ- ExoVII- double mutant was extremely sensitive. The addition of an ExoI- mutation augmented this sensitivity, suggesting that all three exonucleases play partially redundant roles in DNA repair. The ability to inherit genetic markers by conjugation was reduced modestly in the ExoI- RecJ- mutant, implying that the function of either ExoI or RecJ exonucleases enhances RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination.

TI  - [The utility of various Doppler parameters at rest and during exercise for the diagnosis of residual stenosis after operation for aortic coarctation. A doppler-nuclear magnetic resonance comparison]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The postoperative follow-up of aortic coarctation (AoCo) is often characterized by persistent arterial hypertension, sometimes due to a residual narrowing at the site of surgical repair. A residual stenosis > or = 30% is considered to be significant. Anatomy of the aortic arch is best assessed by angiography, transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of these invasive and expensive procedures for routine examination in all patients who develop late systemic hypertension cannot be justified. Consequently, it would appear to be useful to find some noninvasive methods, such as Doppler gradients, that are capable of identifying any residual anatomic narrowing. OBJECTIVES: We compared different Doppler parameters obtained at rest and during exercise with the degree of narrowing at the site of surgical repair measured by MRI, in order to identify the indices predictive of residual stenosis. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (26 M, 13 F) were studied after AoCo repair. Mean age was 21.7 +/- 9.7 years (9-49). Their age at the time of repair was 10 +/- 9.7 years (0.1-27) and the postoperative follow-up was 11.5 +/- 6 years (2-25). Systolic blood pressure measurement and Doppler echo for calculation of the transisthmic gradient at rest and during exercise on a bicycle ergometer were performed in all patients. The peak systolic gradient (PGs) over the isthmus was calculated using the simplified Bernoulli equation: PGs = 4 x (V2(2)-V1(2)), where V1 and V2 are the peak velocities in the ascending and descending aorta. In addition, at the end of exercise the peak diastolic gradient (PGd) was measured at the end of the T wave on the ECG, and the systolic velocity half-time (SVHT), as the time interval from the peak to the half peak systolic velocity. MRI of the aorta was performed to measure the diameter of the isthmus (AI) and of the descending aorta at the diaphragm (DA). Residual narrowing at the isthmus was expressed as stenosis % = [(1-(AI/DA)]%. RESULTS: At rest: systolic blood pressure 128.3 +/- 22.5 mmHg, PGs 15.9 +/- 8.1 mmHg (1-32). None of the patients had PGd. At peak exercise: systolic blood pressure 207 +/- 37 (160-265) mmHg, PGs 32.3 +/- 14.7 mmHg (8-70), SVHT 96 +/- 23 msec (60-139) and PGd 7.2 +/- 4.8 mmHg (1-17). Stenosis % measured by MRI was 23.1 +/- 14.5% (0-53) and in particular, it was < 30% in 25 patients and > or = 30% in 14 patients. Both the PGs at rest and the other Doppler parameters at peak exercise (PGs, SVHT, PGd) correlated with stenosis %. SVHT together with PGd on exercise Doppler represented the combination of two variables that was best for predicting a residual stenosis. When all three variables obtained by exercise Doppler were combined, every patient with residual stenosis was correctly identified. In particular, the combination (PGs > or = 28 mmHg + SVHT > or = 108 msec + PGd > or = 8 mmHg) identifies all patients with stenosis > or = 30%, while the combination (PGs < or = 38 mmHg + SVHT < 108 msec + PGd < 10 mmHg) excluded those with significant stenosis. CONCLUSION: Parameters obtained from the transisthmic gradient (PGs, SVHT, PGd) measured at peak exercise by CW-Doppler can diagnose a residual stenosis % in operated AoCo. We propose using this noninvasive method of identifying patients who need to be referred for MRI.

TI  - Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff.  
AB  - We present the results of arthroscopic repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff in seventy-three patients (thirty-nine men and thirty-four women). The average age of the patients at the time of the operation was 60.7 years (range, thirty-one to eighty-two years). All of the patients were followed for at least two years (average, thirty months; range, twenty-four to forty months). The shoulders were evaluated with the rating scale of the University of California at Los Angeles, the shoulder index of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and the functional rating scale of Constant and Murley. In addition, the patients completed the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) preoperatively and at the yearly follow-up evaluations. Eleven tears were small (less than one centimeter in length), forty-five were medium (one to three centimeters), eleven were large (more than three to five centimeters), and six were massive (more than five centimeters). The average length of the tear was twelve millimeters, and the average width was twenty-seven millimeters. Sixty-nine tendons were repaired anatomically, and four were repaired an average of three millimeters (range, two to eight millimeters) medial to the anatomical insertion of the tendon. An average of 2.3 (range, one to four) suture anchors were used in the repair. Sixty-three glenohumeral joints were normal, and ten had an intra-articular lesion. Seven patients had a concomitant resection of the acromioclavicular joint. The average duration of the operation was fifty-six minutes (range, thirty-five to ninety minutes). The active and passive ranges of motion improved significantly after the procedure (p = 0.0001). The strength of resisted elevation improved from 7.5 to 14.0 pounds (3.4 to 6.3 kilograms) (p = 0.0001). The average total score according to the rating scale of the University of California at Los Angeles improved from 12.4 to 31.1 points; the average total score according to the shoulder index of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, from 30.7 to 87.6 points; and the average absolute score according to the rating system of Constant and Murley, from 41.7 to 83.6 points (p = 0.0001 for all comparisons). The average score for the pain component of the rating scale of the University of California at Los Angeles improved from 2.4 to 8.6 points; fifty-seven (78 per cent) of the seventy-three patients rated the relief of pain as good or excellent on the visual-analog scale. The average score for satisfaction improved from 0.4 to 4.6 points; sixty-six patients (90 per cent) rated their satisfaction as good or excellent at the time of the most recent examination. None of the shoulders were rated as good or excellent before the operation, whereas sixty-one (84 per cent) were so rated at the most recent follow-up evaluation after the index procedure. In addition, significant improvements (p = 0.0015) were noted in the scales and summary measures of the SF-36.  Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff produced satisfactory results with regard to traditional orthopaedic criteria as well as with regard to patient-assessed criteria such as satisfaction, pain relief, and general health. The arthroscopic method offers several advantages, including smaller incisions, access to the glenohumeral joint for the inspection and treatment of intra-articular lesions, no need for detachment of the deltoid, and less soft-tissue dissection. However, these advantages must be considered against the technical difficulty of the method, which limits its application to surgeons who are skilled in both open and arthroscopic procedures on the shoulder.

TI  - Intraoperative decision making in the treatment of shoulder instability.  
AB  - Between April 1990 and April 1994, 100 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of anterior instability underwent a diagnostic arthroscopy of the shoulder. Patients with isolated SLAP lesions were excluded from the study. Patients with multidirectional instability, bony Bankart lesions, and large Hill-Sachs lesions were also excluded. Football players and dominant arm throwing athletes were also excluded. Thirty patients remained who had post-traumatic, unidirectional, anterior instability and a repairable Bankart lesion and did not have any exclusions as noted above. All of these patients underwent an initial attempt at an arthroscopic Sure-Tac stabilization (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA). Twenty-three patients met our criteria for a secure fixation but 7 did not. These 7 underwent an immediate arthrotomy and open Bankart repair. All of the patients were available at follow-up at an average of 47 months (range, 36 to 72 months). The patients were evaluated by the Rowe shoulder rating scale. There have been two cases of recurrent subluxation and one case of recurrent dislocation in the Sure-Tac group. All three occurred over 2 years later. All three had recurrent Bankart lesions and underwent an arthrotomy and Bankart repair. There were no cases of recurrence of subluxation or dislocation in our initial open Bankart repair group. Sure-Tac arthroscopic anterior stabilization of the shoulder can initially give good results but these results appear to deteriorate over time and increased activity of the patient. We currently do not recommend a Sure-Tac repair even in a selective group of patients with an isolated Bankart lesion. This is based on our excellent results following an open Bankart repair and a 13% recurrence rate following Sure-Tac stabilization in carefully selected patients.

TI  - Should coronary artery bypass grafting be performed at the same time as repair of a post-infarct ventricular septal defect?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The value of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at the time of repair of a post-infarct ventricular septal defect (VSD) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of CABG on early mortality and survival following repair of an acquired VSD. METHODS: Over 23 years, 179 patients, 118 male, 61 female, mean age 66 years (range 43-80), have undergone repair of a post-related VSD in our unit. A total of 29 patients, who predominantly form the earlier part of the series, were operated on greater than 1 month after the infarct and are, therefore, excluded. Coronary angiography was performed in 98 (65.3%) of the remaining 150 patients. Of these, 41 had coronary artery disease (CAD) limited to the infarct-related vessel and 57 had additional significant CAD. Those with CAD limited to the infarct-related vessel were not grafted (Group A). Of those, 40 with significant CAD underwent CABG at the time of VSD repair (Group B) and 17 did not (Group C). In 52 patients the coronary anatomy was not documented (Group D). Risk factors for early mortality were evaluated using logistic regression. Actuarial survival was compared using log rank and Wilcoxon tests. Cox's proportional hazards method was used to determine factors affecting survival. RESULTS: Overall, 30 day mortality was 32%. CABG did not significantly decrease operative mortality (logistic regression). There was no statistically significant difference in early mortality or actuarial survival between the four groups. CABG was not associated with an increased survival (Cox's method). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant CABG at the time of VSD repair does not affect early mortality nor confer survival benefits. There seems to be no demonstrable benefit in revascularisation at the time of repair and, therefore, it may be unnecessary to perform CABG or coronary angiography in these patients.

TI  - Specific RecA amino acid changes affect RecA-UmuD'C interaction.  
AB  - The UmuD'C mutagenesis complex accumulates slowly and parsimoniously after a 12 Jm(-2) UV flash to attain after 45 min a low cell concentration between 15 and 60 complexes. Meanwhile, RecA monomers go up to 72,000 monomers. By contrast, when the UmuD'C complex is constitutively produced at a high concentration, it inhibits recombinational repair and then markedly reduces bacterial survival from DNA damage. We have isolated novel recA mutations that enable RecA to resist UmuD'C recombination inhibition. The mutations, named recA [UmuR], are located on the RecA three-dimensional structure at three sites: (i) the RecA monomer tail domain (four amino acid changes); (ii) the RecA monomer head domain (one amino acid change, which appears to interface with the amino acids in the tail domain); and (iii) in the core of a RecA monomer (one amino acid change). RecA [UmuR] proteins make recombination more efficient in the presence of UmuD'C while SOS mutagenesis is inhibited. The UmuR amino acid changes are located at a head-tail joint between RecA monomers and some are free to possibly interact with UmuD'C at the tip of a RecA polymer. These two RecA structures may constitute possible sites to which the UmuD'C complex might bind, hampering homologous recombination and favouring SOS mutagenesis.

Post-operative morbidity was low with two cases of serohematic effusion treated by puncture. Mean hospital stay was 2.5 days. Patients returned to normal activity within 7 days but work stoppage in active patients depended more on patient motivation than the initial surgical procedure. There were no reiterative recurrences although follow-up is too short (mean 21.2 months) for definitive results.

TI  - Effect of a novel antibiotic, heliquinomycin, on DNA helicase and cell growth.  
AB  - Heliquinomycin, a novel microbial product, was found to inhibit a human DNA helicase enzyme isolated from HeLa S3 cells at concentrations of 5 to 10 micrograms/ml. In contrast, adriamycin, etoposide and cisplatin did not inhibit this enzyme at the concentrations tested. Furthermore, the replication and repair of SV40 chromosome were not affected at heliquinomycin concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. The topoisomerase II and I enzymes were inhibited at 30 micrograms/ml and 100 micrograms/ml of heliquinomycin, respectively. Heliquinomycin inhibited the growth of HeLa S3, KB, LS180, K562 and HL60 human tumor cell lines at IC50 values of 0.96 to 2.8 micrograms/ml. In addition, the growth of adriamycin and cisplatin resistant P388 cell lines were inhibited at similar concentrations. Heliquinomycin inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis in cell culture but did not inhibit protein synthesis. HeLa S3 cells were arrested at the G2/M phase by heliquinomycin. These studies suggest that heliquinomycin is a selective inhibitor of a cellular DNA helicase and in turn, inhibits growth of tumor cell lines.

TI  - Repair of the mitral valve because of pure rheumatic mitral valvar incompetence in the young.  
AB  - Between January 1985 and April 1994, 42 children aged between 7 and 14 years (mean 11.3 years) underwent repair of severely incompetent rheumatic mitral valves with no accompanying mitral stenosis. In 19 patients the tricuspid valve was severely incompetent, while 8 patients had severe aortic incompetence. Overall, the repair incorporated shortening of elongated tendinous cords and insertion of a Duran or Carpentier prosthetic ring. The repair was the sole procedure in 15 patients, whilst 19 patients also had a De Vega tricuspid valvar annuloplasty and 8 had repair or replacement of the aortic valve. There were no hospital deaths. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiographic studies revealed trivial residual mitral valvar regurgitation in 6 patients, mild regurgitation in 18, moderate in 15, and regurgitation severe enough to warrant replacement of the mitral valve in 3 patients. The mean follow-up period was 37 months (maximum 120 months, minimum 1 month). Of 39 patients followed-up, 28 attended for more than 5 years. Of these, 7 underwent replacement of the mitral valve for severe regurgitation within 4 years of the repair. Severe mitral regurgitation in 3 patients was controlled by medical therapy. One was eventually lost to follow-up, and one patient died of causes unrelated to surgery. The remaining 16 patients had absent to moderate mitral valvar regurgitation. These results contrast with 10 repairs of congenital mitral incompetence, where no patients required re-operation in the immediate 5 years period of follow-up. Every effort should be made in children with rheumatic mitral incompetence to preserve the natural valve by conservative repair, despite the fact that repair of the incompetent rheumatic mitral valve is not so durable as repair of congenitally incompetent valves.

TI  - Mutants with changes in different domains of yeast replication protein A exhibit differences in repairing the control region, the transcribed strand and the non-transcribed strand of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MFA2 gene.  
AB  - We have analysed the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at nucleotide resolution from the MFA2 gene of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in strains harbouring mutations in one of the yeast replication protein A (RPA) genes, RFA1. This gene codes for the 70 kDa subunit of RPA and it has previously been shown to have a role in nucleotide excision repair. Here two RFA1 mutants were examined: rfa1-M2 which is mutated in the protein interaction domain and rfa1-M4 which is mutated in the DNA-binding domain. A distinct difference in the removal of CPDs from the MFA2 sequence of these two mutants was observed. Compared to the parental strain, there was no defect in CPD removal in the rfa1-M2 mutant. Contrarily, the rfa1-M4 mutant was totally defective in the global repair of CPDs from the non-transcribed strand and the non-transcribed portions of the strand containing the transcribed sequence, yet it was able to perform reduced transcription coupled repair of the transcribed strand. These results indicate that the role of the DNA-binding domain of RPA is different for global repair versus transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - [Cicatrization of complete traumatic lesions of the posterior cruciate ligament. Magnetic resonance follow-up of 10 cases and a proposal for modification of Gross classification]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traumatic injuries of the knee ligaments present in various degrees of severity from interstitial sprains to complete ligament tears. The femoral insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is susceptible to post-traumatic ischemic changes secondary to interrupted vascular supply from the tibial insertion. In comparison, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) has more extensive vascularization from the posterior geniculate arteries, which allows better healing of these injuries with fibrous scar tissue. MRI of a scarred PCL injury shows lower than normal signal intensity, which post-traumatic changes in signal intensity are well described in the literature. In my personal experience with more than 5500 MR examinations of the knee, PCL traumatic injuries secondary to motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries are a frequent finding. Many of these patients are completely asymptomatic for articular instability. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From November, 1994, to July, 1997, a direct MR follow-up was proposed to patients with PCL traumatic tears. Only the patients examined in our hospital were included in this study because the MR scans were performed using the same unit, matrix, FOV, slice thickness and sequences. Twenty patients had acute traumatic injuries of the PCL. Four were not examined because of an additional traumatic episode and four were not included because they were operated on. Ten patients were thus enrolled: three women and seven men whose age ranged 23 to 41 years (mean: 35.7). MR follow-up ranged 9 to 36 months (average: 14.2). RESULTS: At the first MR examination, PCL tears were classified as follows: Gross class II (1 patient) and Gross class III (9 patients). Follow-up MRI showed no PCL in 2 patients (similar to ischemic degeneration in complete ACL tears), focal interligament changes within a continuous PCL in 2 patients and normal PCL in 6 patients. The trauma was caused by a motor vehicle accident with the knee flexed in 8 patients and during hyperflexion in sports activity (skiing or soccer) in 2 patients. Five patients presented with knee instability and subjective complaints, such as pain and difficulty in climbing stairs, walking, running, or performing sports activity. Follow-up MRI showed natural repair of the PCL traumatic injury in 5 patients, with absolutely no knee instability. CONCLUSION: Even though the number of patients in this study is limited, follow-up MRI confirms the possibility of scar tissue repair in PCL post-traumatic injuries, supporting primary conservative treatment.

TI  - Use of a free bladder mucosal graft for simple repair of vesicovaginal fistulae.  
AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe a simple, fast, and effective method for repair of difficult vesicovaginal fistulae by means of a free bladder mucosal graft. Six patients with high, large, multiple, or recurrent vesicovaginal fistulae were treated using a free bladder mucosal graft. Three patients underwent "early" repair (less than 3 months from time of injury) and 3 "late" repair (more than 6 months from time of injury). Via a suprapubic cystotomy, the mucosa of the fistulous tract was debrided without any attempt to excise the tract or close the bladder or vaginal defects. A free bladder mucosal graft was harvested from an unaffected portion of the bladder and placed over the fistulous tract, and mucosal approximation was made using interrupted 5-0 chromic stay sutures. The donor urothelial defect was allowed to re-epithelialize. A Foley catheter, suprapubic tube, and vaginal packing were left in place. Five patients noted an immediate result, with no evidence of leakage, and the suprapubic tube was removed by week 3. One patient required prolonged catheter drainage, and the tube was successfully removed by week 6. This patient had undergone irradiation. All patients remain dry at follow-up, which ranges from 2 to 6 years. We describe a simple and effective method for transabdominal vesicovaginal fistula repair, involving minimal mobilization, decreased dissection, and no need for rotational or interposition flaps, obviating the need to open the peritoneum. A free bladder mucosal graft can be used regardless of the individual anatomy or proximity to the ureteral orifices, because it can easily be tailored. This technique represents an important repair of difficult, recurrent, or multiple vesicovaginal fistulae.

AB  - Only three cases of the combination of bicuspid aortic valve and ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva, associated with previously repaired coarctation of aorta, have been reported. A twenty-year-old man with a sudden onset of CHF due to ruptured aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva underwent intracardiac repair by direct closure of the sinus Valsalva in combination with patch closure of a subarterial VSD. Although, no AR was detected preoperatively, massive regurgitation occurred after the repair due to subsequent failure of aortic valve coaptation in the present of the bicuspid aortic valve, which was not diagnosed preoperatively. Aortic valve replacement with SJM 25 mm was successfully performed.

TI  - Repair of congenital tricuspid valve abnormalities with artificial chordae tendineae.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, including Ebstein's malformation, dysplasia, straddling, and those found in pulmonary atresia with intact septum and congenitally corrected transposition, are an uncommon cause of tricuspid regurgitation. Congenital tricuspid valve anomalies are found as a spectrum of disease in which both the leaflets and the subvalvar apparatus are often involved. Tricuspid valve repair is complicated in such patients because the chordae tendineae are often abnormally short and thick. Replacement or augmentation of chordae tendineae has proved to be a useful component of mitral valve repair. In the present report, we describe the techniques and results of chordal augmentation in the repair of congenital tricuspid valve abnormalities. METHODS: Since July 1992, tricuspid valve repair has been performed in 5 children with severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve with significant chordal pathology. As a component of the repair, chordal replacement or augmentation was performed using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture. RESULTS: Intraoperative and postoperative echocardiographic assessment showed good mobility of the tricuspid valve leaflets and trivial to mild tricuspid regurgitation. There were no complications and no early or late mortality. At follow-up of 34 to 60 months (median, 49 months), tricuspid valve function has remained excellent in 4 of the 5 patients. In the remaining patient, progressive regurgitation of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery allograft conduit has led to right ventricular dilatation, with a secondary increase in tricuspid regurgitation from trivial to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Chordal replacement or augmentation with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture is a useful technique in the repair of congenitally dysplastic tricuspid valves with abnormal chordal structures.

The method of transpulmonary balloon catheter occlusion and repair of pediatric ductus arteriosus is herein reported in older patients using a Foley catheter and normothermic bypass. Transesophageal echocardiography is crucial in assessing the size of the ductus and confirming adequacy of repair. The technique is simple and safe even in the presence of a wide, short ductus.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta receptor expression on human skin fibroblasts: dimeric complex formation of type I and type II receptors and identification of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored transforming growth factor-beta binding proteins.  
AB  - Fibroblasts play a critical role in wound repair and in the development of fibrotic diseases, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to profoundly modulate fibroblast function. However, there is limited information on the TGF-beta receptor types, isoform specificity, and complex formation in skin fibroblasts. Here, we report that normal adult human skin fibroblasts display two isoform-specific, cell surface glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, TGF-beta binding proteins in addition to the type I, II, and III TGF-beta receptors. The identities of these proteins are confirmed on the basis of their affinity for TGF-beta isoforms, immunoprecipitation with specific antireceptor antibodies, and other biochemical analyses. Immunoprecipitation results also indicated oligomeric complex formation between type I and II and between type II and III TGF-beta receptors. Furthermore, by using affinity labeling and two-dimensional electrophoresis, we demonstrate the occurrence of type I and II heterodimers and type I homodimers of TGF-beta receptors on these cells. Because the type I receptor does not bind TGF-beta in the absence of type II receptor, these results indicate that one molecule of TGF-beta induces the formation of a heterooligomeric complex containing more than one molecule each of type I and II TGF-beta receptors on these cells. These cells respond to TGF-beta by markedly down-regulating all five binding proteins and by potently augmenting DNA synthesis. These results allow the expansion of the proposed heteromeric TGF-beta receptor signaling paradigm using mutant cells that are unresponsive to TGF-beta and cell lines that have been transfected to overexpress these receptors, to include normal TGF-beta-responsive cells. In addition, the definition of TGF-beta receptor profiles in human skin fibroblasts provides important information for studying their alterations in these cells in various skin diseases.

TI  - Recovery of damaged glomerular capillary network with endothelial cell apoptosis in experimental proliferative glomerulonephritis.  
AB  - Capillary repair can occur in damaged glomeruli in recovery models of glomerulonephritis (GN). In order to clarify whether capillary repair is an essential component in glomerular recovery from GN, we have examined the development of the capillary repair after inflammatory injury in both the repairing glomeruli and the segmental sclerotic scar lesions in Thy-1 GN. Mesangiolytic glomerular damage was induced in rats with anti-Thy-1.1 antibody administration. Diffuse mesangiolysis and segmental microaneurysmal ballooning developed in damaged glomeruli by day 3, with reduction of endothelial cellularity. Thereafter, histological proliferative GN developed between day 5 and week 3. Endothelial cell proliferation began on day 1 and peaked on day 5, and the number of glomerular endothelial cells increased and exceeded the level of control values on day 7. Angiogenic glomerular capillary repair occurred through the process of not only capillary regeneration from remaining endothelial cells in capillary aneurysmal lesions but also new capillary growth derived from the glomerular vascular poles by day 7. The number of glomerular capillary lumina also increased to the level of controls by week 3. Subsequently, mesangial proliferative GN resolved, and most of the glomeruli recovered to their normal structure with the reconstruction of the capillary network by weeks 4-6. In the glomerular capillary repair, significant apoptosis of glomerular endothelial cells was present during the period of mild endothelial cell hypercellularity between day 7 and day 10 (0.06 +/- 0.02 apoptotic endothelial cells/glomerular cross section vs. 0.00 +/- 0.00 in controls, mean +/- SEM; p < 0.05. In Thy-1 GN, most of the damaged glomeruli recovered with angiogenic capillary repair. However, segmental sclerotic scar lesions remained in 10-30% of the glomeruli with an incomplete repair of glomerular capillaries. Therefore, it is concluded that following the destruction of the glomerular capillary network in GN, angiogenic capillary repair plays an essential role in the recovery of damaged glomeruli, and incomplete capillary repair leads to sclerotic scar lesions in damaged glomeruli. Glomerular capillary repair occurs through the process of capillary regeneration from remaining endothelial cells as well as new glomerular capillary growth from the glomerular vascular poles. In glomerular capillary repair, apoptosis is necessary in regulating the number of intrinsic endothelial cells.

TI  - Risk of late reoperations in patients with acute type A aortic dissection: impact of a more radical surgical approach.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and risk factors for reoperations on the pre-isthmic aorta after repair of type A acute aortic dissection. METHODS: From January 1979 to December 1996, 178 patients (125 males and 53 females with a mean age of 57 +/- 9 years) underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection with an overall operative mortality rate of 21%. One hundred and forty-one patients (100 males and 41 females, aged 58 +/- 12 years), were discharged after successful replacement of the ascending aorta in 136 cases (96%) with extension to the transverse arch in 22 (16.2%) and associated total root or aortic valve replacement in 31 (22.8%) and 6 (4.4%) cases, respectively. Intimal tear resection and direct primary anastomosis of the aorta were performed in 5 patients (4%). Total follow-up was 690 patient-years, mean 5.1 +/- 4.1 years, with an actuarial survival rate at 5,10 and 15 years of 88%, 73% and 42%, respectively. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (13%), 13 males and 6 females, aged 50 +/- 10 years, required a total of 22 reoperations with an actuarial freedom from reoperation at 5, 10 and 15 years of 94%, 64% and 35%, respectively. Initial repair consisted of replacement of the ascending aorta in 16 (84%) cases, with total root replacement in 2 (12%) and isolated aortic valve replacement in 1 (6%). Three patients (16%) were treated by intimal tear resection and direct primary anastomosis of the aorta. Mean interval between initial repair and reoperation was 5.2 +/- 3.1 years and indication to re-do surgery were severe aortic regurgitation in 2 (11%), aneurysmal evolution of the false lumen in 4 (21%) or both in 13 (68%). Extensive aortic reconstruction comprising simultaneous graft replacement of the aortic root, ascending aorta and aortic arch was necessary in 13 cases (68%), isolated replacement of the ascending aorta in 3 (16%), aortic valve in 2 (11%) and aortic arch in 1 (5%). There were 1 hospital (5%) and 2 late (11%) deaths at a mean follow-up of 2.5 +/- 2.4 years, with an actuarial survival at 5 years of 88%. Retrospective analysis of our total experience revealed that the introduction of the open distal anastomosis technique since 1990, reduced the incidence of reoperation from 11/46 (24%) to 8/95 (8.4%) (P < 0.05). However, also with this strategy 8/73 (11%) patients surviving replacement limited to the ascending aorta required reoperation versus none of the 22 patients surviving repair extended to the aortic arch. Three out of 5 (60%) patients undergoing intimal tear resection and primary anastomosis of the aorta early in our experience, required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Management of patients with acute type A aortic dissection may include one or more surgical procedures after the initial emergency repair. Reoperations carry a low operative risk with good long-term survival and their incidence is reduced by routine open distal anastomosis and aggressive replacement of the aortic arch. Intimal tear resection and primary anastomosis of the aorta appear to be associated with increased risk of reoperation.

TI  - Persistent collateral perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair does not lead to progressive change in aneurysm diameter.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To differentiate between the phenomenon of collateral perfusion from a side branch versus graft-related endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), with respect to aneurysm size and prognosis. METHODS: We successfully treated 64 AAA patients with endovascular grafting. We followed all the patients postoperatively with spiral computed tomography at one, three, six and 12 months, and biannually thereafter. We measured aneurysm diameters preoperatively and postoperatively. We calculated preoperatively the relation of maximum aortic diameter (D) to the thrombus-free lumen diameter (L) expressed as an L/D ratio. Median follow-up was 15 months. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had collateral perfusion during follow-up. We successfully treated two patients with embolization. One patient showed resolution of collateral perfusion after we stopped warfarin treatment. Two patients died of unrelated causes during follow-up. One patient was converted to surgical treatment, and two patients showed spontaneous resolution of their collateral perfusion. The group of patients with perfusion showed no statistically significant change of their aortic diameter on follow-up. The group of patients without perfusion showed a median decrease in aortic diameter of 8mm (p < 0.0001) at 18 months postoperatively. The group of patients with perfusion had significantly less thrombus in their aneurysm sac preoperatively than the group without perfusion, as expressed by the L/D ratio (mean L/D 0,61 versus 0,78, respectively; p=0.0021.) CONCLUSION: There was no significant increase in aortic diameter on an average 18 months postoperatively despite persistent collateral perfusion. This may indicate a halted disease progression in the short term. Embolization of collateral vessels is associated with risk of paraplegia. We recommend a conservative approach with close observation if aneurysm diameter is stable.

TI  - Detection of natural bioantimutagens and their mechanisms of action with bacterial assay-system.  
AB  - Escherichia coli K12 assay-system is designed in order to detect bioantimutagens, agents preventing mutagenesis by modulation of DNA repair and replication. The assay is composed of four tests aimed at the detection of inhibition of spontaneous and induced mutations (Tests A and B) and at the estimation whether the anti-mutagenic agent acts by increasing the fidelity of DNA replication (Test B), by inhibition of SOS error prone repair (Test C), or by favoring error-free recombinational repair (Test D). In Test A, repair proficient strain and its uvrA counterpart are used for detection of spontaneous and UV-induced mutations, while in Test B mismatch repair deficient strains (mutH, mutS, mutL and uvrD) are used for amplified detection of spontaneous mutations caused by replication errors. In Test C, repair proficient strain carrying sfiA::lacZ fusion is used for measuring the level of SOS induction by monitoring the level of beta-galactosidase. In Test D, the strains carrying different recA alleles (recA+, recA730 and DeltarecA) are used for measuring intrachromosomal recombination between nonoverlapping deletions in duplicated lac operon, by monitoring Lac+ recombinants. The assay-system is validated with model bioantimutagens and used for detection of anti-mutagenic potential of different terpenoid fractions from sage (Salvia officinalis L.). Extract E1/3 of cultivated sage, distinguished from others by its high content of monoterpenoid camphor, reduces UV-induced mutagenesis in Test A, while it has no effect in Tests B and C. In Test D, it enhances intrachromosomal recombination in untreated and UV-irradiated recA+ and recA730 strains. The results suggest that the protective effect is due to stimulation of recombinational repair, similarly to coumarin. We speculate that monoterpenoids from sage enhance genetic recombination by intervening in a formation of RecA-DNA complex and channeling it into recombination reaction.

TI  - Posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse: primary repair in 693 patients.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the results of primary repair of posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse in a current, large series of patients with long-term follow-up. METHODS: From January 1976 to December 1987, 693 patients underwent primary repair of vault prolapse at the Mayo Clinic. The Mayo culdoplasty technique was used in 95% of these patients. Patients were followed up by reference to their Mayo Clinic medical records, a specifically designed questionnaire, and pelvic examination in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: The median age at operation was 66 years. Abdominal hysterectomy had been performed on 49.5% of patients and vaginal hysterectomy on 43.4% (hysterectomy type was not documented on 7.1%). The median number of years to vault prolapse repair after hysterectomy was 15.8 (range 0.4-48.4). Information about prolapse after primary repair was available for 504 patients (72.7%) and 80 had evidence or complaint (bulge, protrusion) of recurrent prolapse. Thirty-six of 693 patients (5.2%) had subsequent prolapse repair. Eighty-two percent of patients indicated satisfaction with the result. Complications of operation included entry into the bladder or rectum (2.3% of patients), vault hematoma (1.3%), cuff infection (0.6%), and ureteral complications (0.6%). The number of patients presenting for vault prolapse repair increased during the study interval. CONCLUSION: The Mayo culdoplasty can be performed with minimal morbidity. It achieved an anatomic restoration of upper vaginal support in a high percentage of patients with long-term follow-up.

TI  - Chemical approaches toward understanding base excision DNA repair.  
AB  - Despite the importance of DNA repair in protecting the genome, the molecular basis for damage recognition and repair remains poorly understood. In the base excision repair pathway (BER), DNA glycosylases recognize and excise damaged bases from DNA. This review focuses on the recent development of chemical approaches that have been applied to the study of BER enzymes. Several distinctive classes of noncleavable substrate analogs that form stable complexes with DNA glycosylases have recently been designed and synthesized. These analogs have been used for biochemical and structural analyses of protein-DNA complexes involving DNA glycosylases, and for the isolation of a novel DNA glycosylase. An approach to trap covalently a DNA glycosylase-intermediate complex has also been used to elucidate the mechanism of DNA glycosylases.

TI  - Small slipped register genetic instabilities in Escherichia coli in triplet repeat sequences associated with hereditary neurological diseases.  
AB  - Genetic instability investigations on three triplet repeat sequences (TRS) involved in human hereditary neurological diseases (CTG.CAG, CGG.CCG, and GAA.TTC) revealed a high frequency of small expansions or deletions in 3-base pair registers in Escherichia coli. The presence of G to A polymorphisms in the CTG.CAG sequences served as reporters for the size and location of these instabilities. For the other two repeat sequences, length determinations confirmed the conclusions found for CTG.CAG. These studies were conducted in strains deficient in methyl-directed mismatch repair or nucleotide excision repair in order to investigate the involvement of these postreplicative processes in the genetic instabilities of these TRS. The observation that small and large instabilities for (CTG.CAG)175 fall into distinct size classes (1-8 repeats and approximate multiples of 41 repeats, respectively) leads to the conclusion that more than one DNA instability process is involved. The slippage of the complementary strands of the TRS is probably responsible for the small deletions and expansions in methyl-directed mismatch repair-deficient and nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells. A model is proposed to explain the observed instabilities via strand misalignment, incision, or excision, followed by DNA synthesis and ligation. This slippage-repair mechanism may be responsible for the small expansions in type 1 hereditary neurological diseases involving polyglutamine expansions. Furthermore, these observations may relate to the high frequency of small deletions versus a lower frequency of large instabilities observed in lymphoblastoid cells from myotonic dystrophy patients.

TI  - Immediate and delayed nerve repair using freeze-thawed muscle autografts in complex nerve injuries. Associated arterial injury.  
AB  - Five sheep underwent repair of the median nerve along with the establishment and repair of a brachial artery defect adjacent to the site of nerve injury. The defect in the brachial artery was of similar length to the nerve defect and lay in parallel with it. It was repaired using a reversed vein autograft harvested from one of the superficial veins of the arm. A further five sheep underwent similar treatment with the repair of the nerve delayed for 30 days after the establishment of the complicating vascular injury. Six months after the nerve repair, each group of sheep was assessed using electrophysiological and morphometric methods in order to establish objective indices of nerve recovery and regeneration. These results were compared with those from other sheep which had undergone nerve repair both immediate and delayed with no complicating injury and groups in which the complicating injury consisted of a cavity, fibrosis and haematoma. It was found that delay in the nerve repair and the presence of a complicating arterial injury, both separately and additively, contributed to a poorer outcome in recovery of nerve function and maturation. The effect of an arterial injury, in both of these respects, was to produce a worse outcome than the presence of a cavity with fibrosis and haematoma.

TI  - Immediate and delayed nerve repair using freeze-thawed muscle autografts in complex nerve injuries. Associated arterial injury.  
AB  - Five sheep underwent repair of the median nerve along with the establishment and repair of a brachial artery defect adjacent to the site of nerve injury. The defect in the brachial artery was of similar length to the nerve defect and lay in parallel with it. It was repaired using a reversed vein autograft harvested from one of the superficial veins of the arm. A further five sheep underwent similar treatment with the repair of the nerve delayed for 30 days after the establishment of the complicating vascular injury. Six months after the nerve repair, each group of sheep was assessed using electrophysiological and morphometric methods in order to establish objective indices of nerve recovery and regeneration. These results were compared with those from other sheep which had undergone nerve repair both immediate and delayed with no complicating injury and groups in which the complicating injury consisted of a cavity, fibrosis and haematoma. It was found that delay in the nerve repair and the presence of a complicating arterial injury, both separately and additively, contributed to a poorer outcome in recovery of nerve function and maturation. The effect of an arterial injury, in both of these respects, was to produce a worse outcome than the presence of a cavity with fibrosis and haematoma.

TI  - Mutation of yeast Ku genes disrupts the subnuclear organization of telomeres.  
AB  - The mammalian Ku70 and Ku86 proteins form a heterodimer that binds to the ends of double-stranded DNA in vitro and is required for repair of radiation-induced strand breaks and V(D)J recombination [1,2]. Deletion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes HDF1 and HDF2--encoding yKu70p and yKu80p, respectively--enhances radiation sensitivity in a rad52 background [3,4]. In addition to repair defects, the length of the TG-rich repeat on yeast telomere ends shortens dramatically [5,6]. We have shown previously that in yeast interphase nuclei, telomeres are clustered in a limited number of foci near the nuclear periphery [7], but the elements that mediate this localization remained unknown. We report here that deletion of the genes encoding yKu70p or its partner yKu80p altered the positioning of telomeric DNA in the yeast nucleus. These are the first mutants shown to affect the subnuclear localization of telomeres. Strains deficient for either yKu70p or yKu80p lost telomeric silencing, although they maintained repression at the silent mating-type loci. In addition, the telomere-associated silencing factors Sir3p and Sir4p and the TG-repeat-binding protein Rap1p lost their punctate pattern of staining and became dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm. Our results implicate the yeast Ku proteins directly in aspects of telomere organization, which in turn affects the repression of telomere-proximal genes.

TI  - Re-epithelialization of the rat cornea is accelerated by blockade of opioid receptors.  
AB  - A native opioid peptide, [Met5]-enkephalin, termed opioid growth factor (OGF), serves as a constitutively expressed and autocrine produced inhibitory molecule related to developing, neoplastic, renewing, and healing tissues. The present study was designed to examine the effects of interfering with opioid-receptor interaction during re-epithelialization of the cornea in the rat using both systemic injections and topical applications of the potent opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX). A 4 mm diameter epithelial defect was made in the center of the rat cornea. NTX injected twice daily or applied as eyedrops four times daily significantly accelerated re-epithelialization compared to controls. Beginning as early as 8 h after wounding, both the systemic and topical NTX treatment groups had defects that were approximately 10% to 67% smaller than control abrasions at the time points examined. Similarly, the rate of healing for the NTX groups was 4.7- and 2.8-fold greater than controls for systemic and topical paradigms, respectively. The incidence of complete re-epithelialization in animals given systemic administration of NTX was markedly accelerated in comparison to control rats; however, differences in incidence of repair between NTX and control groups receiving topical application were not observed. These results show that native opioid peptides function in wound healing, and exert a tonically inhibitory influence at the receptor level on repair of corneal epithelial injuries.

AB  - A 20-year-old man was treated for posteroinferior acromioclavicular dislocation. The diagnosis was based on standard radiographs and intraoperative findings. The distal end of the clavicle had impaled the supraspinatus muscle. Open reduction was performed 2 weeks after injury, followed by wire fixation of the acromioclavicular joint and repair of the torn superior acromioclavicular ligament and coracoclavicular ligaments. Two years after the procedure, standard radiographs revealed normal anatomic alignment of the acromioclavicular joint, with pain free range of motion. Active elevation in the scapular plane was 180 degrees, active external rotation was 80 degrees in the anatomic position, and passive internal rotation was to the T5 vertebra. The patient returned to playing baseball and tennis and was satisfied with the postoperative result.

TI  - Endogenous lesions, S-phase-independent spontaneous mutations, and evolutionary strategies for base excision repair.  
AB  - We calculate from published levels of endogenous base lesions that our cells constantly generate and excise during base excision repair (BER) about one million lesions per day.  Repair glycosylases may also non-specifically excise an additional number of undamaged bases. The resulting abasic sites are repaired daily by BER. The fidelity of polymerase-beta is 2.4x10(-5) and one must postulate additional fidelity mechanisms in the BER complex to explain the low mutation rate of resting cells. Any strategy which constitutively increases glycosylase activity to prevent endogenous lesions from entering S-phase and becoming mutations will also serve to increase the number of mutations per day caused by non-specific excision of normal undamaged bases. The best break-even strategy for reducing endogenous lesion-induced mutations is clearly not one of avid repair. Lower organisms from bacteriophage to fungi have adopted strategies to generate 0.0033 consequential mutations per cell division, no more and no less. Strategies such as down regulating glycosylase activity outside of S-phase to reduce time-dependent mutation frequency while leaving lesion replication-induced mutation frequency unchanged are discussed.

TI  - Splitting the ATM: distinct repair and checkpoint defects in ataxia-telangiectasia.  
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive human disorder that, because of its multisystem nature, is of interest to scientists and clinicians from many disciplines. A-T patients have defects in the neurological and immune systems, telangiectasia in the eyes and face, and are, in addition, cancer-prone and radiation-sensitive. A-T cell lines have a range of diverse phenotypes including sensitivity to ionizing radiation and defects in cell-cycle checkpoint control. The ATM protein is a member of the PI 3-kinase-like superfamily, and it has been widely accepted that A-T cells represent mammalian cell-cycle checkpoint mutants and that the radiation sensitivity is a consequence of this defect. However, several lines of evidence suggest that A-T cells have distinct repair and checkpoint defects. A-T cells therefore appear to harbour dual checkpoint/repair defects. Here, we review the evidence supporting this contention and consider its implications for an analysis of the A-T phenotype.

TI  - Modern surgical treatment of anal incontinence.  
AB  - New surgical treatment modalities have been developed for patients with anal incontinence resulting from extensive sphincter destruction and in whom standard sphincter repair has failed. These new modalities include the transposition of striated skeletal muscles combined with implantation of neurostimulators, artificial sphincters based on the same principle as artificial urinary sphincters, and direct sacral nerve stimulation. In a few reported series muscle transposition in combination with neurostimulation has given a satisfactory continence in 50-70% of the patients. The same is true for the smaller series published on artificial anal sphincters, whereas the results of sacral nerve stimulation have thus far been reported in only a few patients. The selection of patients and the performance of these procedures should be limited to few specialist centres.

TI  - Mitral valve repair: an odyssey to save the valves!  
AB  - The history of mitral valve repair surgery is an interesting odyssey that has nearly spanned the century. However, since the mid 1970s, both European and North American surgeons have developed and expanded these techniques to where repair of myxomatous valves is now expected by most cardiologists and patients. Preoperative functional assessment is most important to determine the specific needs for repair. Today, transesophageal echocardiography is the standard by which cardiologists and surgeons rely for these data. Herein, both methods of assessment and techniques for repair are detailed. The multidisciplinary approach is emphasized. Risks of surgery are detailed as well as long-term outcomes compared with replacement of the mitral valve. Lastly, surgical results from the 235 patients repair series at the East Carolina University School of Medicine are detailed and discussed. This series showed a 1.8% mortality rate for myxomatous valve patients, with a very low reoperative rate. This compared with a higher mortality rate of 5.6% for the overall group, which emphasizes the increased risk associated with an ischemic etiology. The author provides not only an overview but also tips to surgeons beginning to repair valves.

TI  - Efficient repair of all types of single-base mismatches in recombination intermediates in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Competition between long-patch and G-T glycosylase-mediated repair of G-T mismatches.  
AB  - Repair of all 12 single-base mismatches in recombination intermediates was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Extrachromosomal recombination was stimulated by double-strand breaks in regions of shared homology. Recombination was predicted to occur via single-strand annealing, yielding heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) with a single mismatch. Nicks were expected on opposite strands flanking hDNA, equidistant from the mismatch. Unlike studies of covalently closed artificial hDNA substrates, all mismatches were efficiently repaired, consistent with a nick-driven repair process. The average repair efficiency for all mispairs was 92%, with no significant differences among mispairs. There was significant strand-independent repair of G-T --> G-C, with a slightly greater bias in a CpG context. Repair of C-A was also biased (toward C-G), but no A-C --> G-C bias was found, a possible sequence context effect. No other mismatches showed evidence of biased repair, but among hetero-mismatches, the trend was toward retention of C or G vs. A or T.  Repair of both T-T and G-T mismatches was much less efficient in mismatch repair-deficient cells (approximately 25%), and the residual G-T repair was completely biased toward G-C. Our data indicate that single-base mismatches in recombination intermediates are substrates for at least two competing repair systems.

TI  - Long-term outcome after the mustard repair for simple transposition of the great arteries. 28-year follow-up.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines the late outcome in patients with simple transposition of the great arteries (TGA) after a Mustard operation. BACKGROUND: Continuing medical follow-up for patients after the Mustard procedure, now extending to three decades, is required. The quality of life of adult survivors has not been well documented. METHODS: Survival and quality of life among 113 hospital survivors of the Mustard operation performed for simple TGA between 1964 and 1982 were assessed by medical review and a lifestyle questionnaire. The incidence of right ventricular failure and echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) were determined. A measure of lifestyle, the ability index, was determined. RESULTS: Actuarial survival was 90%, 80%, and 80% at 10, 20, and 28 years, respectively, with 76% of survivors being New York Heart Association class 1. Sudden death, with an incidence of 7% without identifiable risk factors, was the most common cause of late demise. RVD was identified in 18% of patients who had echocardiography, but there was right ventricular failure in only two patients. Seventy-five percent of current survivors lead a normal life, 20% have some symptoms or lifestyle modification, and 5% are unable to work. CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients to 28 years with the Mustard repair has been good. Late sudden death is the most worrisome feature. There is a 97% freedom from right ventricular failure to date. The quality of life of late survivors is good, most achieving a normal level of education and employment.

TI  - Can intrarenal duplex waveform analysis predict successful renal artery revascularization?  
AB  - PURPOSE: No currently available noninvasive test can preoperatively predict a successful outcome to renal revascularization. Resistance measurements from the renal parenchyma obtained with duplex sonography reflect the magnitude of intraparenchymal disease, and patients with extensive intrarenal disease may respond less favorably to revascularization. To address this question, we reviewed our (primarily) operative experience in patients undergoing renal artery revascularization, and compared the blood pressure (BP) and renal function response with resistance measurements obtained from the kidney both before and after revascularization. METHODS: During a 56-month period, 31 consecutive renal artery revascularizations (25 surgical and 6 percutaneous angioplasties) were performed in 23 patients (21 atherosclerotic, 2 fibromuscular dysplasia). Duplex sonography was performed in each patient before and after revascularization, and parenchymal diastolic/systolic (d/s) ratios were calculated. BP and renal function response to intervention were compared with measurements of intrarenal flow patterns before and after revascularization. RESULTS: Mean parenchymal peak systolic velocity was significantly higher after repair in all patients (pre-repair: 19.5 +/- 1.3, postrepair: 27.2 +/- 1.7; P < .0001). Despite this, there were no statistical differences between preoperative and postoperative parenchymal d/s ratios. A favorable (cured or improved) BP response was seen in 81% (17 of 21) of revascularizations performed for hypertension. Among these successes, parenchymal d/s ratios were in the normal range (ie, > or = 0.30) both before and after repair (mean prerepair: 0.34 +/- 0.03, mean postrepair: 0.31 +/- 0.03; not significant). In 4 patients in which BP failed to improve after intervention, the d/s ratio was abnormal before surgery (< 0.3), and remained so after revascularization (mean preoperative d/s ratio: 0.18 +/- 0.04, mean postoperative d/s ratio: 0.11 +/- 0.04; P = .003). Mean preoperative parenchymal d/s ratios were significantly higher in all patients with a successful BP response when compared with failures (P = .048). Similarly, among patients with single artery repairs, mean preoperative d/s ratios approached significance in successes vs. failures (success: 0.40 +/- 0.03, failure: 0.21 +/- 0.03; P = .054). A decrease in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 20% was seen in 8 of 18 patients (44%) with ischemic nephropathy. These patients also had normal d/s ratios preoperatively (mean 0.39 +/- 0.04), whereas the 10 patients who failed to improve had significantly lower ratios (mean 0.24 +/- 0.03; P = .041). Kidney length did not correlate with d/s ratio. CONCLUSION: Although we do not believe that duplex sonographic measurement of intrarenal flow patterns alone is an accurate means of assessing main renal artery occlusive disease, the resistive indices seem to reflect the magnitude of intraparenchymal disease, and thus may provide important prognostic information for patients undergoing surgical revascularization. Our data suggest that a preoperative d/s ratio below 0.3 correlates with clinical failure relative to BP and renal function responses.

TI  - Role of MutS ATPase activity in MutS,L-dependent block of in vitro strand transfer.  
AB  - In addition to mismatch recognition, Escherichia coli MutS has an associated ATPase activity that is fundamental to repair. Hence, we have characterized two MutS mutant gene products to define the role of ATP hydrolysis in homeologous recombination. These mutants, denoted MutS501 and MutS506, have single point mutations within the Walker A motif, and rate constants for ATP hydrolysis are down 60-100-fold as compared with wild type. Both MutS501 and MutS506 retain mismatch binding and, unlike wild type, fail to relinquish this specificity in the presence of ATP, adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), and adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate. Both MutS501 and MutS506 blocked the level of strand transfer between M13 and fd DNAs. The level of inhibition varied between the mutants and corresponded with the relative affinities to a G/T mispair. Neither MutS501 nor MutS506, however, would afford complete block of full-length heteroduplex in the presence of MutL. DNase I footprinting data are consistent with these results, as the region of protection by MutS501 and MutS506 was unchanged in the presence of ATP and MutL. Taken together, these studies suggest that 1) MutS impedes RecA-mediated homeologous exchange as a distinct mismatch-provoked event and 2) the role of MutL is coupled to MutS-dependent ATP hydrolysis. These observations are in good agreement with the present model for E. coli methyl-directed mismatch repair.

TI  - The role of 3'-5' exonucleolytic proofreading and mismatch repair in yeast mitochondrial DNA error avoidance.  
AB  - In the D171G/D230A mutant generated at conserved aspartate residues in the Exo1 and Exo2 sites of the 3'-5' exonuclease domain of the yeast mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase (pol-gamma), the mitochondrial genome is unstable and the frequency of mtDNA point mutations is 1500 times higher than in the wild-type strain and 10 times higher than in single substitution mutants. The 10(4)-fold decrease in the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of the purified mtDNA polymerase is associated with mismatch extension and high rates of base misincorporation. Processivity of the purified polymerase on primed single-stranded DNA is decreased and the Km for dNTP is increased. The sequencing of mtDNA point mutations in the wild-type strain and in proofreading and mismatch-repair deficient mutants shows that mismatch repair contributes to elimination of the transitions while exonucleolytic proofreading preferentially repairs transversions, and more specifically A to T (or T to A) transversions. However, even in the wild-type strain, A to T (or T to A) transversions are the most frequent substitutions, suggesting that they are imperfectly repaired. The combination of both mismatch repair and proofreading deficiencies elicits a mitochondrial error catastrophe. These data show that the faithful replication of yeast mtDNA requires both exonucleolytic proofreading and mismatch repair.

AB  - The symptom of a garden path in sentence processing is an important anomaly in the input string. This anomaly signals to the parser that an error has occurred, and provides cues for how to repair it. Anomaly detection is thus an important aspect of sentence processing. In the present study, we investigated how the parser responds to unambiguous sentences that contain syntactic anomalies and pragmatic anomalies, examining records of eye movement during reading. While sensitivity to the two kinds of anomaly was very rapid and essentially simultaneous, qualitative differences existed in the patterns of first-pass reading times and eye regressions. The results are compatible with the proposal that syntactic information and pragmatic information are used differently in garden-path recovery.

TI  - The effects of soft-tissue expansion on lip repair and midfacial growth in a rabbit cleft lip model.  
AB  - Midfacial hypoplasia following primary cleft lip repair is a common clinical correlate. Recent experimental work has suggested that increased lip pressure following an undermined lip repair may contribute to midfacial growth inhibition. Soft-tissue expansion has been used to generate additional soft tissue for reconstruction in the cranial region. The use of this technique in the labial region may allow lip repair to be performed with less tension (pressure) and thus facilitate midfacial growth. To test this hypothesis, 40 4-week-old rabbits were randomly divided into four groups. Two groups had surgically created lip and alveolar defects. Ipsilateral labial tissue expanders were placed in all four groups. One cleft and one normal group underwent expansion. The other two groups served as a control. The expanders were removed at 4 weeks, and an undermined lip repair was performed in both cleft groups. Findings revealed that soft-tissue expansion increased labial surface area significantly by approximately 96% (p < 0.001). Labial soft-tissue expansion alone had no effect on midfacial growth during the observation period. In contrast, cleft animals undergoing tissue expansion exhibited significantly reduced (p < 0.05) postoperative lip pressure and increased midfacial growth compared with cleft animals without expansion through 36 weeks of age. Results suggest that preoperative tissue expansion reduced postoperative lip pressure and improved midfacial growth in a rabbit cleft lip model.

TI  - Microsatellite mutation rates in cancer cell lines deficient or proficient in mismatch repair.  
AB  - A selectable system has been used to determine mutation rates within a microsatellite sequence in human cancer cell lines with or without defects in mismatch repair. A sequence consisting of 17 repeats of poly (dC-dA).poly(dT-dG) [abbreviated as (Ca)17] was inserted near the 5' end of the bacterial neomycin-resistance gene in a plasmid vector, such that the reading frame of the neo gene is disrupted. This plasmid was introduced into cancer cell lines, where it became integrated into the cellular genome. Clones with insertions or deletions of CA-repeats that restored the normal reading frame of the neo gene were selected in G418, and mutation rates were determined by fluctuation analysis. The rates of reversion in LoVo cells, which are deficient for hMSH2, were about one in a thousand per generation, which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than in the repair-proficient HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line. The mutation rates in H6 cells, which are derived from the hMLH1-deficient HCT116 line, were more heterogeneous than in LoVo, but all were considerably higher than in the repair-proficient line. Nearly all of the revertants of the repair-deficient lines had deletions of a single CA-repeat from the microsatellite sequence, whereas repair-proficient cells had a broader spectrum of mutations.

All the repaired samples were again subjected to compressive load. The fracture resistance values of repaired and unrepaired restorations were recorded and statistically analysed. Results concluded that, the repair of hybrid composites resin gave in general higher fracture resistance values than microfilled composite. Roughening and etching the surface of old restoration before bonding agent application gave the highest fracture resistance values. It was also found that bonding agent alone without roughening or etching gave the lowest fracture resistance values.
