TI  - Cefuroxime resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Susceptibility to cefotaxime and ceftazidime despite production of ESBLs.  
AB  - The production of beta-lactamases, the outer membrane protein (OMP) patterns, some clinical impacts and the prevalence of resistance among cefuroxime-resistant Danish clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were investigated. Fifteen resistant and five susceptible strains were collected from 14 patients during 1991-1994. Isolates from five patients produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Cefuroxime resistance was accompanied by a 10-fold elevation of ciprofloxacin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), and for some isolates by an alteration of the OMP pattern. The relationship between alterations of the OMP patterns and cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin and the other antibiotics tested was not universal. Ten of the cefuroxime-resistant strains had elevated MICs of cefotaxime or ceftazidime, but the MICs were still below the breakpoint for susceptibility. The MICs of imipenem were not affected. Nosocomial infection or long-term colonization with resistant strains may be of importance since five patients were not treated with cefuroxime prior to isolation of the resistant strain, and all patients had either serious diseases or stayed at the hospital for a long period of time. The prevalence of cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin resistance among clinical isolates from Copenhagen county during 1990-1995 was 8.3% and 7.5%, respectively, but higher for urinary tract specimens. A greater consumption of cefuroxime as compared to cefotaxime and ceftazidime in this study, as seen generally in Denmark, indicated that ESBLs produced by the investigated strains of K. pneumoniae may be selected with cefuroxime.

TI  - Two alpha(1,2) fucosyltransferase genes on porcine chromosome 6q11 are closely linked to the blood group inhibitor (S) and Escherichia coli F18 receptor (ECF18R) loci.  
AB  - The Escherichia coli F18 receptor locus (ECF18R) has been genetically mapped to the halothane linkage group on porcine Chromosome (Chr) 6. In an attempt to obtain candidate genes for this locus, we isolated 5 cosmids containing the alpha (1,2)fucosyltransferase genes FUT1, FUT2, and the pseudogene FUT2P from a porcine genomic library. Mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization placed all these clones in band q11 of porcine Chr 6 (SSC6q11). Sequence analysis of the cosmids resulted in the characterization of an open reading frame (ORF), 1098 bp in length, that is 82.3% identical to the human FUT1 sequence; a second ORF, 1023 bp in length, 85% identical to the human FUT2 sequence; and a third FUT-like sequence thought to be a pseudogene. The FUT1 and FUT2 loci therefore seem to be the porcine equivalents of the human blood group H and Secretor loci. Direct sequencing of the two ORFs in swine being either susceptible or resistant to adhesion and colonization by F18 fimbriated Escherichia coli (ECF18) revealed two polymorphisms at bp 307 (M307) and bp 857 (M857) of the FUT1 ORF. Analysis of these mutations in 34 Swiss Landrace families with 221 progeny showed close linkage with the locus controlling resistance and susceptibility to E. coli F18 adhesion and colonization in the small intestine (ECF18R), and with the locus of the blood group inhibitor S. A high linkage disequilibrium of M307-ECF18R in Large White pigs makes the M307 mutation a good marker for marker-assisted selection of E. coli F18 adhesion-resistant animals in this breed. Whether the FUT1 or possibly the FUT2 gene products are involved in the synthesis of carbohydrate structures responsible for bacterial adhesion remains to be determined.

TI  - Chloroquine versus pyrimethamine/sulphadoxine in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in northern Kenya.  
AB  - The response of P. Falciparum to chloroquine (CQ) and pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine (PSD) in vivo was investigated in 173 indigenous uncomplicated malaria patients at Sololo Hospital, Moyale district in northern Kenya. All the patients were symptomatic and parasitaemic. They were divided in two age groups (children < 10 years, adults > 10 years). They were randomly assigned to receive either CQ or PSD standard treatment and then followed up at 7 and 14 days. In the child group, out of 91 patients enrolled, 65 (71.4%) completed the seven-day study; among these 38 (17 females and 21 males with mean age of 41.9 months) were treated with CQ and 27 (11 females and 16 males with mean age 39.1 months) with PSD. Parasites were significantly (p < 0.001) more resistant to CQ (18/38, 47.4%) than PSD (0/27, 0%). In the adult group, out of 82 patients enrolled, 54 (65.9%) completed the 7-day-study, and among these 27 (10 females and 17 males with mean age of 22.5 years) were treated with CQ and 27 (11 females and 16 males with mean age of 23.2 years) with PSD. Parasites were significantly (p = 0.01) more resistant to CQ (7/20, 25.9%) than PSD (0/27, 0%). Overall, considering the 119 patients who completed the follow-up, the resistance of P. falciparum was significantly higher (p < 0.001) to CQ (25/65, 38.5%) than to PSD (0/54, 0%). Out of the 94 patients with negative slide at day 7, fifty seven came at the control of the day 14 (30 children and 27 adults). Among them, 22 were in CQ group and five were found positive (22.7%), while the 35 patients in PSD group all tested negative (p = 0.006).  The resistance to CQ in the children group was 25% (p = 0.05) and 20% in the adult group (p = 0.13). We conclude that the significant parasitological resistance to CQ in the area under study questions the continued use of CQ as first line antimalarial treatment. On the contrary, PSD can still be considered a very effective drug against P. falciparum in northern Kenya.

TI  - Functional expression of a tobacco gene related to the serine hydrolase family -- esterase activity towards short-chain dinitrophenyl acylesters.  
AB  - We have recently reported the isolation of a tobacco gene, hsr 203J, whose transcripts accumulate during the hypersensitive reaction, a plant response associated with resistance to pathogens. We present and discuss here some structural and biochemical properties of the gene product. Nucleotide sequence analysis has shown that the hsr 203J gene contains an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 335 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence contains the GXSXG motif characteristic of serine hydrolases, and displays limited but significant similarity to lipases and esterases of prokaryotic origin. The hsr 203J gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein, purified to near homogeneity, was able to degrade p-nitrophenylbutyrate, a general substrate for carboxylesterases. The enzyme was unable to hydrolyze lipids, and was active on short-chain acyl esters only. The hydrolytic activity was abolished by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and a derivative of isocoumarin, as expected for a member of the serine hydrolase family. Sequence similarities between the tobacco esterase and expressed sequence tags in databases suggest the existence of members of this enzyme family in various plant species.

AB  - The pattern of mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains that confer resistance to didanosine (ddI) was analyzed in 2 groups of patients receiving either ddI monotherapy or ddI plus hydroxyurea (HU) combination therapy. Twelve patients receiving combination therapy and 8 receiving monotherapy were tested. Combinations of ddI plus HU did not prevent the onset of mutations, which emerged in 50% of the patients in this group compared with 25% of the ddI monotherapy group. In addition, in 1 patient from the combination therapy arm, who had a limited response to the therapy, an unusual pattern of mutations was found: the insertion of 2 amino acids between residues 69 and 70, a region critical for resistance to nucleoside analogs. The higher efficacy of the combination of HU and ddI compared with that of ddI monotherapy cannot be attributed to a delayed or decreased onset of resistance to ddI.

TI  - [Mechanism of multidrug resistant tumors and chemotherapeutic approaches against the resistant tumors]  
AB  - Research on multidrug resistance (MDR) has spread widely, with the emphasis on the development of therapeutic approaches. This line of research began in the early 1970s. In 1981 and 1982, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and calmodulin inhibitors were found to enhance the intracellular levels of vincristine (VCR) and adriamycin (ADM) in resistant tumor cells by inhibiting their outward transport and to circumvent MDR in animal experiments. Since these results were noted for verapamil, various other compounds have been investigated to overcome drug resistance. Among these compounds, two compounds were evaluated in our laboratory. The non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin derivative SDZ PSC833 (PSC) has been shown to reverse MDR completely in vitro and in vivo. The second compound is MS-209, a novel quinoline derivative. MS209 completely reversed the resistance against VCR and ADM in vitro. MS209 enhanced the chemotherapeutic effects of VCR and ADM in P388/VCR- and P388/ADM-bearing mice. MS-209 has now started clinical trials in Japan. In addition to these chemical agents, monoclonal antibodies (moAb) against P-glycoprotein such as MRK16 could be useful tools for selective killing of MDR tumor cells. Furthermore another moAb MRK17 can be used against human MDR cells transfected with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene. M-CSF can act as an enhancer of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in therapy of human MDR cancer with the anti-P-glycoprotein antibody.

TI  - Effect of the inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, on histamine-induced bronchospasm in the rabbit.  
AB  - New Zealand male rabbits were anaesthetized with thiopental, tracheotomized, curarized by vecuronium bromide and mechanically ventilated. Six rabbits received L-NAME 10 mg kg-1 i.v., six rabbits L-NAME 15 mg kg-1 iv, and six rabbits received saline i.v. (controls), 5 min before a histamine aerosol (2% solution during 5 min). Six others rabbits received an injection of L-NAME 15 mg kg-1 iv, 5 min before the histamine aerosol, followed by an infusion of L-arginine over a 60- min period.  Total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) were derived by least square analysis of the relationship between tracheal pressure and flow, and computed every minute before and over a 1-h period after the histamine aerosol. Oxygen free radicals (OFR) were measured with a luminometer, in microsomes from lung homogenates at the end of the experiment. Compared with the histamine response of the control group, the Rrs response in the L-NAME 10 group was slightly less, while Ers changes were the same in the two groups. In contrast, L-NAME 15 was responsible for an increased Rrs response, the difference being significant (P < 0.05) only between 15 and 40 min after the aerosol (+114% vs. +85% in controls at the 20th min). The increase in Ers with L-NAME 15 was stronger and significantly larger (+71% vs. +42% in controls at the 20th min after the histamine aerosol, P < 0.001). The relatively greater effect of L-NAME on Ers than on Rrs suggests that NO predominantly modulates the response to histamine of the peripheral lung rather than that of the large airways. Furthermore, the effect of L-NAME on Rrs was completely abolished by L-arginine, while its effect on Ers was only partially reversed. This suggests that the changes in Ers are partly related to a hardly reversible phenomenon. Possibly, the mechanical changes are linked with the rise of OFR in the lung parenchyma, which were significantly higher in the L-NAME 15 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05).

TI  - High relapse rate among lepromatous leprosy patients treated with rifampin plus ofloxacin daily for 4 weeks.  
AB  - Fifty-one lepromatous leprosy patients, all of whom had relapsed after previous dapsone (DDS) monotherapy, were treated between 1990 and 1991 with 600 mg of rifampin (RMP) plus 400 mg of ofloxacin (OFLO) daily for 4 weeks, and the great majority of the patients were followed up at least once a year after completion of the treatment. After only 173 patient-years of follow-up, 5 relapses had been detected; the overall relapse rate was 10.0% (confidence limits, 1.7 and 18.3%), or 2.9 relapses (confidence limits, 0.4 and 5.4) per 100 patient-years. The unacceptably high relapse rate indicated that 4 weeks of treatment with daily RMP-OFLO was unable to reduce the number of viable Mycobacterium leprae organisms to a negligible level. In addition, the M. leprae from one of the relapses were proved to have multiple resistance to DDS, RMP, and OFLO. To avoid further relapses, the follow-up was terminated and the great majority of the patients were retreated with the standard 2-year multidrug therapy from 1994. No further relapse has been diagnosed since the beginning of retreatment.

TI  - Nonspecific resistance to Mycobacteria: the role of the Nramp1 gene.  
AB  - The genus Mycobacteria consists of over 50 species that include two of the best-known human pathogens, M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, the causes of tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy, respectively. Whereas the spread of leprosy currently appears to be under control, there are presently about 30 million active cases of TB worldwide, with an alarming increase in the number of multidrug resistant case of M. tuberculosis. As strategies for antibiotic intervention against TB become more limited, it is imperative to develop new therapeutic approaches against this oppressive disease. One promising avenue is to characterize the host genes and gene products which regulate resistance to mycobacterial infections. In the mouse, resistance and susceptibility to intracellular growth of Mycobacteria in macrophages is controlled by the Bcg (Nramp1) gene, which has now been cloned and shown to encode a macrophage transmembrane protein with a putative transporter function. Sequencing of Nramp1 revealed that susceptibility to infection is associates with a single, nonconservative glycine to aspartic acid substitution at position 169 (G169D). Although the intracellular location of the Nramp1 protein in macrophages has not yet been determined, a phagosomal site has been postulated. Consistent with the proposed role of Nramp1 in macrophage activation, recent studies of the Nramp1 promoter region have revealed consensus sequences associated with responsiveness to IFN-gamma and LPS. Finally, a total of 11 polymorphisms have been identified within the human NRAMP1 gene which are being used to test for linkage of NRAMP1 alleles with human susceptibility to TB and leprosy.

TI  - Vitamin D metabolism in human colon adenocarcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells: expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1alpha-hydroxylase activity and regulation of side-chain metabolism.  
AB  - 1Alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3) and its synthetic analogues exhibit structure-related variations in their growth inhibitory actions in human colon adenocarcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Because this might be caused by differences in resistance against metabolic degradation, we used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to investigate pathways of vitamin D metabolism in two different Caco-2 cell clones. Importantly, when Caco-2 cells were incubated with tritium-labelled 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) for up to 2 h they produced almost exclusively a metabolite, which was identified as 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 by co-chromatography with the synthetic standard in two different HPLC systems, and by a radioligand assay showing an identical binding affinity to the intestinal nuclear vitamin D receptor. Expression of the 25(OH)D3-1alpha-hydroxylase appears to be constitutive because almost identical enzyme activities are observed in any growth phase. 1Alpha,25(OH)2D3 can also activate side chain metabolism in Caco-2 cells: thereby, 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or 25(OH)D3 are metabolized through the C-24 oxidative pathway into 1alpha,24(R),25(OH)3D3 and 24(R),25(OH)2D3, respectively, which undergo sequential metabolism into 1alpha,25(OH)2-24oxo-D3 and 24-oxo-25(OH)D3. Through C-23 oxidation these intermediary metabolites are further converted into 1alpha,23,25(OH)3-24-oxo-D3 and 23,25(OH)2-24-oxo-D3. Also direct C-23 oxidation of the substrates 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 generates 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)3D3 and 23(S),25(OH)2D3, respectively. In summary, our results demonstrated the presence of distinct pathways of vitamin D metabolism in Caco-2 cells: apart from metabolizing 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 along the C-24 and C-23 oxidative pathways, Caco-2 cells are able to synthesize 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3 through constitutive expression of 25(OH)D3-1alpha-hydroxylase activity. The relevance of this finding for the intrinsic growth control of neoplastic colonocytes is discussed.

TI  - Modulation of idarubicin-induced apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia blasts by all-trans retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.  
AB  - The relationship between differentiation of human myeloid cells and apoptosis remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that terminal differentiation need not necessarily lead to the apoptotic demise of myeloid cells, while other studies have shown that induction of differentiation is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents, such as chemotherapy and gamma-irradiation. Such results are pertinent to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, where differentiating agents and hemopoietic growth factors are being combined with chemotherapy to enhance response and limit toxicity. To elucidate the factors governing apoptosis in human AML blasts, we have studied the cytotoxic effect of idarubicin on HL60, U937 and KG1 cells, after incubation with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ). We show that prior incubation of human myeloid leukemic cells with ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 D3 induced resistance to idarubicin-induced apoptosis, which was modulated by coincubation with GM-CSF. The altered chemosensitivity of cells depended on the degree of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest induced by incubation with ATRA, 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and GM-CSF and was independent of differentiation status or Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression. These findings suggest that cell-cycle arrest in human leukemic cells can be induced by exogenous agents and may promote drug resistance. Determining the mechanisms by which cell-cycle arrest is induced may permit understanding of the processes by which the cells escape cytotoxic drug-mediated apoptosis.

TI  - Viscoelastic behavior of plantar flexor muscle-tendon unit at rest.  
AB  - Muscle stretching as an exercise routine is widely used in orthopaedic and neurological rehabilitation. However, the muscle response to specific stretching parameters is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect parameters, such as stretch velocity, stretch extent, and initial muscle-tendon resistance, on the plantar flexor response to passive movement. Eighteen healthy subjects (23-41 years) participated in this study. Five passive ankle dorsiflexions were randomly imposed at various velocities from 5 degrees/sec to 180 degrees/sec using a Kin-Com dynamometer, while unwanted activations of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were detected with surface electrodes. The resistive torque was averaged at -10 degrees and 0 degree of dorsiflexion. As shown by analyses of variance followed by Scheffe post hoc procedures, the resistive torque was significantly increased (p < 0.01) between 5 degrees/sec and higher velocities (60 degrees/sec or 120 degrees/sec and higher). A strong linear resistive torque-velocity relationship was also observed, as indicated by Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 (-10 degrees) and 0.91 (0 degree). The absolute resistive torque increment, calculated at 180 degrees/sec, was larger at 0 degree of dorsiflexion than at the -10 degrees of dorsiflexion position. Finally, subjects with larger initial plantar flexor resistance had a higher resistive torque increment (p < 0.05) at a high velocity of stretch (180 degrees/sec) than those with less initial muscle-tendon resistance. These results indicate that 1) the nonreflex resistive torque response to stretch is velocity-sensitive and 2) both a larger stretch extent and muscle initial resistance lead to greater resistive torque increments at high velocity. These observations suggest that slow and gradual stretching procedures, rather than rapid or ballistic movements, should be used, especially with stiff muscles to reduce the chance of injury from excessively high tension.

TI  - Nickel release from stainless steels.  
AB  - In 1994, a study of nickel release and allergic contact dermatitis from nickel-plated metals and stainless steels was published in this journal. It was shown that low-sulfur stainless steel grades like AISI 304, 316L or 430 (S < or = 0.007%) release less than 0.03 microgram/cm2/week of nickel in acid artificial sweat and elicit no reactions in patients already sensitized to nickel. In contrast, nickel-plated samples release around 100 micrograms/cm2/week of Ni and high-sulfur stainless steel (AISI 303-S approximately 0.3%) releases about 1.5 micrograms/cm2/week in this acid artificial sweat. Applied on patients sensitized to nickel, these metals elicit positive reactions in 96% and 14%, respectively, of the patients. The main conclusion was that low-sulfur stainless steels like AISI 304, 316L or 430, even when containing Ni, should not elicit nickel contact dermatitis, while metals having a mean corrosion resistance like a high-sulfur stainless steel (AISI 303) or nickel-plated steel should be avoided. The determining characteristic was in fact the corrosion resistance in chloride media, which, for stainless steels, is connected, among other factors, to the sulfur content. Thus, a question remained concerning the grades with an intermediate sulfur content, around 0.03%, which were not studied. They are the object of the study presented in this paper. 3 tests were performed: leaching experiments, dimethylglyoxime and HNO3 spot tests, and clinical patch tests; however, only stainless steels were tested: a low-sulfur AISI 304 and AISI 303 as references and 3 grades with a sulfur content around 0.03%: AISI 304L, AISI 304L added with Ca, AISI 304L+Cu. Leaching experiments showed that the 4 non-resulfurised grades released less than 0.5 microgram/cm2/week in acid sweat while the reulfurized AISI 303 released around or more than 0.5 microgram/cm2/week. This is explained by the poorer corrosion resistance of the resulfurized grade. Yet all these grades had the same reaction to the DMG test (negative result), which shows again its lack of sensitivity. In contrast, the HNO3 spot test distinguished AISI 303 from the non-resulfurized grades. Clinical patch tests again showed that some patients (4%) were intolerant to AISI 303, while none were intolerant to the other grades. Thus, this study confirms that non-resulfurized stainless steels (S < or = 0.03%) like Ni-containing 304 and 304L should not elicit Ni contact dermatitis, while the resulfurized grades (S > 0.1%) should be avoided.

TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of an acetylcholinesterase gene from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti confers insecticide insensitivity.  
AB  - Insecticide resistance is a serious problem facing the effective control of insect vectors of disease. Insensitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) confers resistance to organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate insecticides and is a widespread resistance mechanism in vector mosquitoes. Although the point mutations that underlie AChE insensitivity have been described from Drosophila, the Colorado potato beetle, and house flies, no resistance associated mutations have been documented from mosquitoes to date. We are therefore using a cloned acetylcholinesterase gene from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti as a model in which to perform site directed mutagenesis in order to understand the effects of potential resistance associated mutations.  The same resistance associated amino-acid replacements as found in other insects also confer OP and carbamate resistance to the mosquito enzyme. Here we describe the levels of resistance conferred by different combinations of these mutations and the effects of these mutations on the kinetics of the AChE enzyme. Over-expression of these constructs in baculovirus will facilitate purification of each of the mutant enzymes and a more detailed analysis of their associated inhibition kinetics.

TI  - Plasmodium falciparum: asparagine mutant at residue 108 of dihydrofolate reductase is an optimal antifolate-resistant single mutant.  
AB  - The codon for serine residue 108 of the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase gene was replaced with those for the other 19 amino acids. Except for the Lys108 mutant, which was not expressed, all other substitutions yielded DHFR mutants which were expressed in Escherichia coli as inactive inclusion bodies. Nine of the mutants--Asn108, Thr108, Gly108, Ala108, Gln108, Cys108, Val108, Leu108, and Met108--yielded active DHFR upon refolding of the protein from the inclusion bodies. The remaining mutants--IIe108, Arg108, Pro108, Asp108, His108, Tyr108, Phe108, Trp108, and Glu108--did not exhibit detectable DHFR activity on refolding. The Asn108 mutant had almost unperturbed kinetic parameters but conferred resistance to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil; other active mutants showed poorer DHFR activity. We purified and characterized four mutants which produced highest DHFR activity, i.e., the Gln108, Gly108, Cys108, and Ala108 mutants. These mutant enzymes had kcat/K(m) values ranging from 7 to 22% of the wild-type enzyme. While DHFRs from Gly108, Cys108, and Ala108 mutants were as susceptible to pyrimethamine and cycloguanil as the wild type, the Gln108 mutation conferred high resistance to both inhibitors. Our data suggest that residue 108 is important for antifolate binding, and that the Ser108 to Asn108 mutation was selected in nature because of (i) the need for only a single base change, (ii) its good activity, and (iii) its resistance to antifolates.

TI  - NDR1, a pathogen-induced component required for Arabidopsis disease resistance.  
AB  - Plant disease resistance (R) genes confer an ability to resist infection by pathogens expressing specific corresponding avirulence genes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, mediated by several R gene products, requires the NDR1 gene. Positional cloning was used to isolate NDR1, which encodes a 660-base pair open reading frame. The predicted 219-amino acid sequence suggests that NDR1 may be associated with a membrane. NDR1 expression is induced in response to pathogen challenge and may function to integrate various pathogen recognition signals.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a pigmentless-conidium mutant of Aspergillus fumigatus with altered conidial surface and reduced virulence.  
AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus is an important pathogen of immunocompromised hosts, causing pneumonia and invasive disseminated disease with high mortality. The factors contributing to the predominance of A. fumigatus as an opportunistic pathogen are largely unknown. Since the survival of conidia in the host is a prerequisite for establishing disease, we have been attempting to identify factors which are associated with conidia and, simultaneously, important for infection. Therefore, an A. fumigatus mutant strain (white [W]) lacking conidial pigmentation was isolated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that conidia of the W mutant also differed in their surface morphology from those of the wild type (WT). Mutant (W) and WT conidia were compared with respect to their capacities to stimulate an oxidative response in human phagocytes, their intracellular survival in human monocytes, and virulence in a murine animal model. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was 10-fold higher when human neutrophils or monocytes were challenged with W conidia compared with WT conidia. Furthermore, mutant conidia were more susceptible to killing by oxidants in vitro and were more efficiently damaged by human monocytes in vitro than WT conidia. In a murine animal model, the W mutant strain showed reduced virulence compared with the WT. A reversion analysis of the W mutant demonstrated that all phenotypes associated with the W mutant, i.e., altered conidial surface, amount of reactive oxygen species release, susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide, and reduced virulence in an murine animal model, coreverted in revertants which had regained the ability to produce green spores. This finding strongly suggests that the A. fumigatus mutant described here carries a single mutation which caused all of the observed phenotypes. Our results suggest that the conidium pigment or a structural feature related to it contributes to fungal resistance against host defense mechanisms in A. fumigatus infections.

TI  - Immunological approaches for the control of fasciolosis.  
AB  - The immunological relationship between liver flukes and their mammalian hosts is being unravelled by in vivo and in vitro studies. Vaccine studies in cattle and sheep with purified antigens (fatty acid binding protein, FABP; glutathione S-transferase, GST; cathepsin L, CatL; hemoglobin) have shown that high reductions in worm burdens (31-72%) and egg production (69-98%) can be achieved, raising the realistic possibility that immunological control of Fasciola infection is a commercially achievable goal. Combination vaccines may also be feasible since a cocktail of CatL and hemoglobin elicits a significant 72% protection in cattle. Analysis of immune responses to Fasciola during infection in ruminants suggests that chronic infection correlates with a type 2 helper T cell response, implying that type 1 helper T cell responses are down-regulated in fasciolosis. Recent results studying the resistance of Indonesian Thin Tail (ITT) sheep to F. gigantica have shown that this breed exhibits high innate (or rapidly acquired) resistance to infection and acquires a higher level of resistance after a primary challenge. Initial studies suggest that the resistance of ITT sheep to F. gigantica may be determined by a major gene. Merino sheep also acquire resistance to F. gigantica. In contrast, ITT and Merino sheep do not exhibit resistance to F. hepatica. These results suggest that there are fundamental differences between these two species of Fasciola in the biology of their interaction with the sheep immune system. In vitro studies on immune mechanisms of killing of juvenile fluke have shown that juvenile larvae of F. hepatica are susceptible to antibody-dependent killing by activated rat macrophages in vitro which is mediated by nitric oxide. Future studies on the immune effector mechanisms expressed by resistant sheep which control infection by F. gigantica will lead to new knowledge which may allow the design of more effective vaccines for fasciolosis.

TI  - Cloning of porcine neuron growth inhibitory factor (metallothionein III) cDNA and expression of the gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Growth inhibitory factor (GIF), a member of the metallothionein (MT) family, is also known as MTIII. This protein distinguishes itself from other MT isoforms by exerting an inhibitory effect on cortical neuron growth instead of metal ion buffering. In this work, we cloned MTIII genes from a porcine brain cDNA library. Two species of clones were isolated that vary with respect to one nt in the coding sequence. This discrepancy results in the translation of two MTIII primary structures having a different amino acid at residue 46. Herein, both MTIII cDNAs were constructed into an expression vector and transformed into yeast cells, respectively. The yeast carrying either MTIII gene displayed a similar metal tolerance when cultured in a medium containing metal.  The resistance to metal toxicity was attributed to the expression of MTIII gene which was confirmed by RNA and protein analyses. The characteristics of the protein stability, metal binding affinity and ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the yeast produced MTIII are also compared with those of MTII. The comparison reveals that both MTs have similar physical characteristics. Moreover, circular dichroism spectrum of Cd saturated MTIII was analyzed as well. Typical Cys-Cd bands for MTII appear in the spectrum, indicating similar metal-thiol interactions for MTIII to those for other MT isoforms.

TI  - Agents that down-regulate or inhibit protein kinase C circumvent resistance to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells that overexpress Bcl-2.  
AB  - The effects of the non-tumor-promoting protein kinase C (PKC) activator bryostatin 1 and the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and UCN-01 were examined with respect to modulation of 1-[beta-D-arabinofuranosyl]cytosine (ara-C)-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60) overexpressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. HL-60/Bcl-2 cells displayed a 5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein compared with empty-vector counter-parts (HL-60/pCEP4) but comparable levels of Bax, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL. After exposure to an equimolar concentration of ara-C (10 microM for 6 hr), HL-60/Bcl-2 cells were significantly less susceptible to apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and loss of clonogenicity than HL-60/pCEP4 cells. The protective effect of increased Bcl-2 expression was manifested by a failure of ara-C to induce activation/cleavage of the Yama protease (CPP32; caspase-3) and degradation of one of its substrates, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase to an 85-kDa cleavage product. When HL-60/Bcl-2 cells were preincubated with bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 24 hr) or coincubated with either staurosporine (50 nM; 6 hr) or UCN-01 (300 nM; 6 hr) after a 1-hr preincubation, exposures that exerted minimal effects alone, ara-C-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were restored to levels equivalent to, or greater than, those observed in empty-vector controls. These events were accompanied by restoration of the ability of ara-C to induce CPP32 cleavage and activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, and inhibition of colony formation. Western analysis of Bcl-2 protein obtained from overexpressing cells treated with bryostatin 1, staurosporine, or UCN-01 revealed the appearance of a slowly migrating species and a general broadening of the protein band, effects that were insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Alterations in Bcl-2 protein mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were reversed by treatment of lysates with alkaline phosphatase or protein phosphatase 2A; actions of the latter were blocked by the specific phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. In vivo labeling studies of Bcl-2 protein demonstrated increased incorporation of [32PO4]orthophosphate in drug-treated cells. Last, phosphorylated Bcl-2 failed to display decreased binding to the proapoptotic protein Bax. Collectively, these findings indicate that bryostatin 1, which down-regulates PKC, and staurosporine and UCN-01, which directly inhibit the enzyme, circumvent resistance of Bcl-2-overexpressing leukemic cells to ara-C-induced apoptosis and activation of the protease cascade. They also raise the possibility that modulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation status contributes to this effect.

TI  - Integrated clinical experience: University of Nebraska Medical Center.  
AB  - The Integrated Clinical Experience (ICE) at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine is a required, two-year course of study for first- and second-year students. It provides early clinical experiences in primary care settings in metropolitan and rural areas, and related instruction in the social, behavioral, and ethical foundations of medicine. The authors describe the course goals, teaching format, topics, and evaluation of students and faculty. ICE is based on the assumptions that medicine is an applied behavioral science as well as an applied biological science, that critical reflection is important in professional education, and that early exposure to primary care will promote interest in primary care careers. The authors also describe some of the challenges associated with the implementation of this new course of study. These include student dissatisfaction with behavioral and ethical topics, resistance to critical reflection about their personal attitudes and values, and discomfort with "subjective" grading. ICE has also been controversial with some basic science faculty who feel they have had to sacrifice curriculum time to make room for this new program. Also, recruiting the large number of faculty, particularly physicians, needed to run the program has been difficult. Finally, the organization of the curriculum, with basic sciences in the morning and the ICE in the afternoon, may inadvertently reinforce the conceptual split between the biomedical and psychosocial dimensions of medicine. Efforts are under way to address this problem by exploring ways to intergrate the curriculum better.

TI  - Nuclear corepressors enhance the dominant negative activity of mutant receptors that cause resistance to thyroid hormone.  
AB  - The syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by multiple distinct mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor-beta (TRbeta). Although the mutant receptors are transcriptionally inactive, they inhibit normal receptor function in a dominant negative manner to cause hormone resistance. Recently, a group of transcriptional cofactors, referred to as corepressors (CoRs), was shown to induce ligand-independent silencing of genes that contain positive T3 response elements. CoRs also play a role in the ligand-independent basal activation of genes that are negatively regulated in response to T3. We hypothesized that CoR might play a role in the dominant negative inhibition by TRbeta mutants that cause RTH. In gel mobility shift assays, RTH mutants retained interactions with CoRs even in the presence of T3, whereas the ligand dissociated CoR from wild-type TRbeta. Using Gal4-TR chimeric receptors and a VP16-CoR fusion protein in an interaction assay, a strong positive correlation was found between mutant receptor interactions with CoR and transcriptional silencing activity. A mutation (P214R) that impairs CoR interactions with TR was introduced into the RTH mutants to assess the role of CoR in dominant negative activity. In transient transfection assays, introduction of the P214R CoR mutation decreased RTH mutant silencing of positively regulated genes and basal activation of negatively regulated genes. The dominant negative activity of several different RTH mutants, studied by cotransfection with wild-type receptor, was greatly diminished by the CoR mutation, and this effect was seen with both positively and negatively regulated genes. These results suggest that CoR interactions play a critical role in the dominant negative effect of RTH mutants and support the idea that these proteins are involved in the regulation of genes that are positively as well as negatively regulated by T3.

TI  - Fetal arterial Doppler-IUGR and hypoxia.  
AB  - Vascular resistances of various fetal areas are assessed by Doppler ultrasound. The PI, RI and S/D indices are measured on the cerebral, renal, aortic and umbilical Doppler spectrum. Ratios of these indices based on the comparison of the cerebral (Rc) and the umbilical (Rp) resistances, or carotid (Rcc) and umbilical resistances, or cerebral (Rc) and aortic (Rao) resistances (Rc/Rp or Rp/Rcc, or Rc/Rao), measure the flow redistribution between the placenta and brain. The umbilical resistance indices, when greater than the upper limit of the normal range (> 2sd) are frequently associated with IUGR. (Sensitivity about 65 to 70%). Absent end diastolic flow is most of the time associated with severe IUGR and hypoxia and poor fetal outcome. A fairly good correlation was found between the existence of significantly decreased (< .2.sd) cerebral resistance and the development of post asphyxial encephalopathy in the neonate (Specificity 75% Sensitivity 87%). The earliest detectors of IUGR and hypoxia are the cerebral-umbilical cerebral-carotid, or cerebral-aortic ratios (Sensitivity 85% specificity 90%). When used as predictor of poor perinatal outcome in growth retarded fetuses, the cerebral umbilical ratio shows a sensitivity of 90% compared with 78% of the middle cerebral artery, and 83% for the umbilical artery indices. Changes of this ratio are well correlated with the fetal pO2 changes. The renal flow response to hypoxia depends on the degree of hypoxia. Opposite responses were found in case of moderate, and severe IUGR or hypoxia. Thus, it is too early to conclude if the renal indices are reliable parameters for the evaluation of fetal hypoxia. The sensitivity in predicting IUGR was for the aortic PI: 41% and for the aortic BFC (Blood flow classes): 57%. In predicting delivery for fetal distress, the corresponding values were 76 and 87%, respectively. Because the resistance indices are heart rate-dependent, it is dangerous to draw any conclusion from one single value of any of these parameters. Only several successive measurement of the Doppler indices or of their ratio, may lead to a reliable evaluation of fetal hemodynamics. In the case of significant IUGR with abnormal Doppler indices it is recommended to repeat the Doppler measurements daily both at the cerebral and umbilical or aortic level in order to follow up the fetal flow redistribution which is highly correlated with the fetal pO2 changes.

TI  - Axon conduction and survival in CNS white matter during energy deprivation: a developmental study.  
AB  - We investigated the postnatal development of axon sensitivity to the withdrawal of oxygen, glucose, or the combined withdrawal of oxygen + glucose in the isolated rat optic nerve (a CNS white matter tract). Removal of either oxygen or glucose for 60 min resulted in irreversible injury in optic nerves from adult rats, assessed by loss of the evoked compound action potential (CAP). Optic nerves at ages <P10 showed no permanent loss of function. CAP sensitivity to the withdrawal of oxygen or glucose emerged during a critical period in development between postnatal days 10-20 (P10-P20). The CAP was unchanged in adult optic nerve for 45 min after the withdrawal of glucose, demonstrating the presence of a significant energy reserve. Periods of glucose withdrawal >45 min caused the selective loss of late CAP components; this was not seen with oxygen deprivation. The amplitude of the early component recovered to 94.8% of control after 60 min of glucose withdrawal, although total CAP area recovered to only 42.3%. Combined oxygen + glucose withdrawal for 60 min produced a greater degree of permanent CAP loss than 60 min of glucose or oxygen withdrawal individually in optic nerves from rats older than P4. Younger than P4 optic nerves showed no permanent loss of function from 60 min of combined oxygen + glucose withdrawal. Unexpectedly, optic nerves from P21-P49 rats recovered significantly less after all three conditions than adult opticnerves (>P50). It is probable that this period of final myelination corresponds to a time of heightened metabolic activity in white matter. The tolerance of CNS white matter to energy deprivation can be categorized into four stages that are correlated with specific developmental features: premyelination (P0-P4), highly tolerant to anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; early myelination (P5-P20), partially tolerant of anoxia and aglycemia but not to combined anoxia/aglycemia; late myelination (P21-P49), very low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia; and mature (>P50), low tolerance of anoxia, aglycemia and combined anoxia/aglycemia.  The relative resistance of optic nerve function to glucose withdrawal in the presence of oxygen, compared with glucose withdrawal in the absence of oxygen, is presumably due to the presence of oxygen-dependent energy reserves such as astrocytic glycogen, amino acids. and phospholipids.

TI  - In vitro metabolism of pyriproxyfen by microsomes from susceptible and resistant housefly larvae.  
AB  - Levels of cytochrome P450 and b5 were investigated in microsomal enzymes of houseflies from the gut and fat body of the third instar larvae of a pyriproxyfen-resistant strain (YPPF) and two pyriproxyfen-susceptible strains (YS and SRS). In comparison to the YS and SRS strains, YPPF microsomes had higher levels of total cytochrome P450s in both the gut and fat body. Furthermore, microsomes from the gut and fat body of YPPF larvae were found to have a much greater ability to hydroxylate aniline than YS larvae. In vitro metabolism studies of pyriproxyfen indicated that the metabolic rates were much higher in both the gut and fat body of YPPF larvae than of YS and SRS larvae. The major metabolites of pyriproxyfen in houseflies were identified to be 4'-OH-pyriproxyfen and 5"-OH-pyriproxyfen. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, piperonyl butoxide (PB) and 2-propynyl 2,3,6-trichlorophenyl ether (PTPE), decreased the metabolic rates significantly in all three strains. This study confirmed that microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases play an important role in the pyriproxyfen resistance of the housefly. Furthermore, it suggests that the fat body must be as important as the gut for the metabolism of pyriproxyfen in resistant housefly larvae.

TI  - Constitutive transduction of peptide transporter and HLA genes restores antigen processing function and cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune recognition of human melanoma cells.  
AB  - Potentiation of immunogenicity of malignant cells by gene transduction provides a unique opportunity for immune targeting of human cancers in vivo. This approach is undoubtedly influenced by the ability of the malignant cells to process and present endogenously target epitopes on their cell surface for immune recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In the present study, we have investigated potential immune-resistance pathways in human malignant melanoma by analyzing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene expression and function in a panel of tumour cell lines. Our analysis showed that a large proportion of these cell lines consistently display a functional defect in the endogenous processing of CTL epitopes and are recognised poorly by specific T cells in spite of high levels of target antigen expression in the tumour cells. Molecular characterisation of this defect revealed that tumour cells under-expressed peptide transporters and surface-assembled MHC class I molecules, which constitute essential components of the class I processing pathway. Induction of peptide transporter and surface class I following treatment of these tumour cells with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) suggested a transcriptional defect in the expression of antigen-processing genes. Endogenous processing function in these tumour cells was restored completely following simultaneous transduction of cells with peptide transporter and HLA class I genes. Our findings provide a rationale for focussing on strategies designed to improve antigen-processing function in tumour cells and, thus, may strongly influence future strategies for melanoma-specific immunotherapy.

TI  - Heterogeneous vasomotor responses of coronary conduit and resistance vessels in hypertension.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between conductance and resistance coronary vasomotor responsiveness in hypertensive patients without atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: Although similar in morphology, conduit and resistance coronary vessels differ importantly in size, function and local environment and appear to be differentially affected in certain disease processes, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. However, little is known about the effect of hypertension on contiguous coronary conduit and resistance vessels in humans. METHODS: Changes in coronary blood flow (a measure of resistance vessel reactivity) and coronary artery diameter (a measure of conduit vessel reactivity) were investigated in response to graded infusion of the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine (ACh) in 98 patients with normal coronary arteries. RESULTS: In 31 normotensive, euglycemic patients, conduit and resistance coronary artery responses to intracoronary infusion of ACh were significantly correlated (r = 0.73, p = 1 x 10[-6]), although eight patients (26%) had constriction of conduit but dilation of resistance arteries at peak effect. In 28 hypertensive patients without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), conduit and resistance artery responses to ACh remained significantly correlated (r = 0.5, p = 0.006), although 12 patients (43%) had discordant findings. Finally, in 39 hypertensive patients with LVH, conduit and resistance artery responses to ACh displayed the lowest correlation (r = 0.38, p = 0.02), with 22 patients (56%) demonstrating conduit artery constriction and resistance artery dilation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite angiographically normal coronary arteries, heterogeneous vasomotor responses (dilation and constriction) were demonstrated in contiguous conduit and resistance arteries in normotensive and hypertensive patients referred for cardiac catheterization because of chest pain. In addition to more severe endothelial dysfunction among conduit and resistance arteries, a greater frequency of discordant conduit and resistance artery responses and resistance vessel constriction was found with increasing severity of hypertension. Our study suggests differing mechanisms of endothelium responsiveness to ACh among conduit and resistance coronary arteries.

TI  - Characterization of mutations contributing to sulfathiazole resistance in Escherichia coli.  
AB  - A sulfathiazole-resistant dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) present in two different laboratory strains of Escherichia coli repeatedly selected for sulfathiazole resistance was mapped to folP by P1 transduction. The folP mutation in each of the strains was shown to be identical by nucleotide sequence analysis. A single C-->T transition resulted in a Pro-->Ser substitution at amino acid position 64. Replacement of the mutant folP alleles with wild-type folP significantly reduced the level of resistance to sulfathiazole but did not abolish it, indicating the presence of an additional mutation(s) that contributes to sulfathiazole resistance in the two strains. Transfer of the mutant folP allele to a wild-type background resulted in a strain with only a low level of resistance to sulfathiazole, suggesting that the presence of the resistant DHPS was not in itself sufficient to account for the overall sulfathiazole resistance in these strains of E. coli. Additional characterization of an amplified secondary resistance determinant, sur, present in one of the strains, identified it as the previously identified bicyclomycin resistance determinant bcr, a member of a family of membrane-bound multidrug resistance antiporters. An additional mutation contributing to sulfathiazole resistance, sux, has also been identified and has been shown to affect the histidine response to adenine sensitivity displayed by these purU strains.

TI  - Retroviral transduction of human CD34+ umbilical cord blood progenitor cells with a mutated dihydrofolate reductase cDNA.  
AB  - Umbilical cord blood cells (UCB) have become a major target population for experimental and clinical studies using transfer of genes involved in inborn enzymatic diseases. Cord blood contains hematopoietic progenitor cells at a high frequency, and expanding these cells ex vivo generates sufficient numbers of hematopoietic precursors for transplantation into adults, e.g., as supportive treatment. As clinical reports about retroviral transduction into UCB cells have not been as encouraging as the first preclinical data, we have established a retroviral transduction system that allows expansion and selection of hematopoietic progenitor cells from UCB. CD34-enriched UCB cells were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a mutated dihydrofolate reductase cDNA that confers MTX resistance. We observed increased resistance to MTX in transduced granulocyte macrophage-colony forming units (CFU-GM) after co-culture of CD34+ UCB cells with the virus-producing cell line, or after incubation with virus-containing supernatant. The supernatant-based transduction protocol included a prestimulation with recombinant interleukin-1 (rhIL-1), rhkit-ligand, and rhIL-3 to increase the percentage of cells in S phase to greater than 50%. Using this protocol we measured a 72-fold expansion of CFU-GM and a 2.5-fold selective advantage of transduced versus nontransduced progenitor cells after exposure to low-dose methotrexate in liquid culture. Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed integration of proviral DNA into the majority of transduced colonies before and after ex vivo expansion. The retroviral vector and transduction protocol reported here provides an experimental system for selection and expansion of retrovirally transduced progenitor/stem cells from UCB that may help improve the efficiency of current clinical gene therapy strategies.

TI  - Relationship between nitrogen mustard drug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X and p53.  
AB  - Several genes have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis including bcl-2, bax, bcl-X and p53. These genes may be important in the development of nitrogen mustard (NM) drug resistance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Using Western blot analysis, we examined the levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X and p53 protein expression and determined whether the levels of these proteins correlated with in vitro drug resistance in CLL patients' lymphocyte samples. Our investigations suggest that in CLL, NM drug resistance develops without any detectable alteration of Bcl-2, Bax or Bcl-X. In addition, we determined the presence of p53 mutations in 14 samples in order to assess if there is an association between in vitro drug resistance and the presence of p53 mutations. Using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis, we observed a p53 mutation in two out of seven resistant samples. The mutation occurring in both cases was a G:C --> A:T transition at codon 273 (exon 8). One of these cases was de novo resistant to the nitrogen mustards. Only one of six samples with acquired resistance to the nitrogen mustards had a p53 mutation suggesting that p53 mutations are not a prominent feature of acquired NM resistance in CLL.

TI  - Anthelmintic resistance.  
AB  - Since the first reports of resistance to the broad spectrum anthelmintics were made some three decades ago, this phenomenon has changed from being considered merely as a parasitological curiosity to a state of industry crisis in certain livestock sectors. This extreme situation exists with the small ruminant industry of the tropical/sub-tropical region of southern Latin America where resistance to the entire broad spectrum anthelmintic arsenal now occurs. In contrast, the cattle industry does not appear to be threatened--or so it seems. Although field reports of resistance have been made to the range of broad spectrum anthelmintics in nematode parasites of cattle, it appears that the evolution of resistance in cattle parasites is not as dramatic as for sheep worms. However, one cannot remain confident that this state of affairs will remain static. Concern is shared amongst parasitologists that we have not looked closely enough. In regions of the world where internal parasites are considered a problem in cattle and drenching occurs frequently, no widespread surveys have been carried out. It appears that because of the very high costs and risks associated with taking a new active drug down the development track to marketing, that the pharmaceutical industry has, in general, turned away from this activity. By implication, the international small ruminant industry is too small for these companies to make the necessary investment. This begs two questions: What is the fate of the sheep (and goat) industries in those parts of the world where resistance is rampant and immediate ameliorative parasite control options are required? What will be the response if significant resistance is found in cattle parasites? There is a body of opinion which suggests that if resistance becomes an issue in the control of cattle parasites then the pharmaceutical industry will find it commercially attractive to re-enter the anthelmintic discovery and development business. This is based on the simple commercial fact that by far the greatest anthelmintic sales are associated with the cattle industry. However, this market is specific and sectoral, with by far the greatest sales in North America and Western Europe, where the prevalence of resistance is likely to be low and remain so, more-or-less indefinitely. So the chances of the above scenario occurring must be considered low. Remarkable developments have recently occurred in non-chemotherapeutic parasite control options, for example worm vaccines, host selection and biological control. Also, there seems to be greater acceptance of various grazing management practices designed to reduce the frequency of anthelmintic treatment. However, they collectively cannot be expected to offer immediate salvation to farmers now faced with chemotherapeutic failure to control nematode parasites in their flocks. The future for these farmers must be considered bleak, because compounded with these problems are the poor commodity prices for sheep and goat meat and fibre, resulting in relentless reductions in funding for research to support these industries. Perhaps the major social issues associated with re-structuring and possibly abandonment of sheep and goat farming in affected areas may precipitate action? As veterinary parasitologists, who in general have an interest and expertise in parasite control, we must promote the importance of the problem of anthelmintic resistance and ways to tackle it.

TI  - Skeletal muscle-specific immunotoxin for the treatment of focal muscle spasm.  
AB  - Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX) is used to treat many disorders characterized by muscular spasms. The utility of BTX, however, is limited by its short duration of action, the development of resistance after repeated injections, and cross-reactivity with autonomic neurons. To overcome these limitations, we engineered an immunotoxin (ITX) to damage skeletal muscle fibers selectively by chemically linking a monoclonal antibody against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to the toxin ricin. In vitro, the ITX was 20,000-fold more toxic to myotubes than myoblasts, consistent with the degree of acetylcholine receptor expression. The gastrocnemius muscles of 30 rats were unilaterally injected with a series of protein toxins at various concentrations and examined histopathologically 7 and 30 days later. ITX produced destructive myopathic changes at a dose 300-fold less than the maximum tolerated dose. Assessment of rat muscle strength after unilateral gastrocnemius injections showed that ITX was more effective and had a longer duration of action than BTX. ITXs may have potential for the treatment of involuntary muscle spasms.

TI  - Retroviral coexpression of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase confers fluoropyrimidine and antifolate resistance.  
AB  - Retroviral gene transfer of dominant selectable markers into hematopoietic cells can be used to select genetically modified cells in vivo or to attenuate the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. We show that retroviral gene transfer of thymidylate synthase (TS) confers resistance to TS directed anticancer agents and that co-expression of TS and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) confers resistance to TS and DHFR cytotoxic agents. Retroviral vectors encoding Escherichia coli TS, human TS, and the Tyr-to-His at residue 33 variant of human TS (Y33HhTS) were constructed and fibroblasts transfected with these vectors conferred comparable resistance to the TS-directed agent fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, approximately 4-fold). Retroviral vectors that encode dual expression of Y33HhTS and the human L22Y DHFR (L22YhDHFR) variants conferred resistance to FdUrd (3- to 5-fold) and trimetrexate (30- to 140-fold). A L22YhDHFR-Y33HhTS chimeric retroviral vector was also constructed and transduced cells were resistant to FdUrd (3-fold), AG337 (3-fold), trimetrexate (100-fold) and methotrexate (5-fold). These results show that recombinant retroviruses can be used to transfer the cDNA that encodes both TS and DHFR and dual expression in transduced cells is sufficiently high to confer resistance to TS and DHFR directed anticancer agents.

TI  - The effect of mismatch repair and heteroduplex formation on sexual isolation in Bacillus.  
AB  - In Bacillus transformation, sexual isolation is known to be an exponential function of the sequence divergence between donor and recipient. Here, we have investigated the mechanism under which sequence divergence results in sexual isolation. We tested the effect of mismatch repair by comparing a wild-type strain and an isogenic mismatch-repair mutant for the relationship between sexual isolation and sequence divergence. Mismatch repair was shown to contribute to sexual isolation but was responsible for only a small fraction of the sexual isolation observed. Another possible mechanism of sexual isolation is that more divergent recipient and donor DNA strands have greater difficulty forming a heteroduplex because a region of perfect identity between donor and recipient is required for initiation of the heteroduplex. A mathematical model showed that this heteroduplex-resistance mechanism yields an exponential relationship between sexual isolation and sequence divergence. Moreover, this model yields an estimate of the size of the region of perfect identity that is comparable to independent estimates for Escherichia coli. For these reasons, and because all other mechanisms of sexual isolation may be ruled out, we conclude that resistance to heteroduplex formation is predominantly responsible for the exponential relationship between sexual isolation and sequence divergence in Bacillus transformation.

TI  -  Resistance to ciprofloxacin in pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae in England and Wales in 1996 [see comments]  
AB  - In 1996, 6% of Escherichia coli from extraintestinal infections were resistant to ciprofloxacin with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > or = 2 mg/l (high level resistance). Low level resistance (MIC 0.125-1 mg/l) was also identified in 7% of Salmonella typhi, 4% of S paratyphi A, and 4% of non-typhoidal salmonellas. However, resistance to ciprofloxacin was rarely identified in shigellas. For E coli, physicians should be aware that treatment failures may occur when patients with invasive illness are treated with ciprofloxacin before the results of laboratory sensitivity tests are available. For salmonellas an increasing number of treatment failures have been recorded for patients infected with strains with low level resistance. Because of the increasing incidence of Enterobacteriaceae with low level resistance to ciprofloxacin, it is recommended that for this group of organisms a breakpoint of 0.125 mg/l should be included in laboratory sensitivity tests.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta and cancer: a love-hate relationship?  
AB  - This commentary proposes the working hypothesis that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can play two different and opposite roles with respect to the process of malignant progression. During the earliest stages of carcinogenesis, TGF-beta can act as potent tumor suppressor and may mediate the actions of chemopreventive agents such as retinoids and tamoxifen. However, at some point during the development and progression of malignant neoplasms, bioactive TGF-betas make their appearance in the tumor microenvironment and the tumor cells appear to escape from TGF-beta-dependent growth arrest. Evidence is accumulating rapidly that this TGF-beta resistance is the consequence of inactivating mutations in any one of the genes that encode signaling intermediates, which include the type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, as well as several Smad proteins. The potential implications of the phenotypic switch from TGF-beta sensitive to TGF-beta resistance that occurs during carcinogenesis for cancer prevention and treatment are discussed.

TI  - Pleiotropy of adaptive changes in populations: comparisons among insecticide resistance genes in Culex pipiens.  
AB  - Resistance to toxicants is a convenient model for investigating whether adaptive changes are associated with pleiotropic fitness costs. Despite the voluminous literature devoted to this subject, intraspecific comparisons among toxicant resistance genes are rare. We report here results on the pleiotropic effect on adult survival of Culex pipiens mutants involved in the same adaptation: the resistance to organophosphorus insecticides. This field study was performed in southern France where four resistance genes sequentially appeared and increased in frequency in response to intense insecticide control. By repeated sampling of overwintering females through winter, we analysed the impact of each of three resistance genes on adult survival. We showed that (i) the most recent gene seems to be of no disadvantage during winter, (ii) the oldest affects survival in some environmental conditions, and (iii) the third induces a constant, severe and dominant survival cost. Such variability is discussed in relation to the physiological changes involved in resistance.

TI  - Vasoconstrictor responses of coronary resistance arteries in exercise-trained pigs.  
AB  - Coronary resistance arteries isolated from exercise-trained pigs have been shown to exhibit enhanced myogenic reactivity (J. M. Muller, P. R. Myers, and M. Harold Laughlin. J. Appl. Physiol. 75: 2677-2682, 1993). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that exercise training results in enhanced vasoconstrictor responses of these arteries to all vasoconstrictor stimuli [specifically acetylcholine (ACh), endothelin-1 (ET-1), KCl, and the Ca2+ channel-agonist Bay K 8644]. Female Yucatan miniature swine were trained (Trn) on a motor-driven treadmill (n = 16) or remained sedentary (Sed, n = 15) for 16-20 wk. Arteries 50-120 micron in diameter were isolated and cannulated with micropipettes, and intraluminal pressure was set at 60 cmH2O throughout experiments. Vasoreactivity was evaluated by examining constrictor responses to increasing concentrations of ACh (10(-9) to 10(-4) M), ET-1 (10(-10) to 10(-8) M), KCl (bath replacement with isotonic physiological saline solution containing 30 or 80 mM), and Bay K 8644 (10(-9) to 10(-6) M). Constricted diameters are expressed relative to the passive diameter observed after 100 microM SNP. All four constrictors produced similar decreases in diameter in arteries from both groups [ACh: 0.52 +/- 0.07 (Trn) and 0.54 +/- 0,06 (Sed); ET-1: 0.66 +/- 0.05 (Trn) and 0.70 +/- 0.07 (Sed); KCl: 0.66 +/- 0.05 (Trn) and 0.70 +/- 0.07 (Sed); Bay K 8644: 0.86 +/- 0.05 (Trn) and 0. 76 +/- 0.05 (Sed)]. Present results combined with previous observations indicate that exercise training does not alter vasoconstrictor responses of porcine coronary resistance arteries but specifically increases myogenic reactivity. Thus the underlying cellular mechanisms for myogenic tone are altered by training but not receptor-mediated mechanisms (ACh and ET-1) nor voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (KCl and Bay K 8644) in coronary resistance arteries.

Associates thus prepared achieved remarkable resistance against nuclease attack, probably due to the formation of PEG palisade surrounding the ion-complexed core of the DNA with the PLL segment of the block copolymer. Further, to estimate the stability of the associate, the rate of interexchange reaction of DNA in the associate with poly(vinyl sulfonate) was evaluated from a method using a metachromasy of toluidine blue dye.

TI  - Effects of antiarrhythmic agents on junctional resistance of guinea pig ventricular cell pairs.  
AB  - Modulation of intercellular coupling through gap junctions can lead to a decrease in conduction velocity and conduction block. Previous studies have suggested that antiarrhythmic agents alter the internal resistance (sum of cytoplasmic and gap junctions resistances) of cardiac fibers. The objective of this study was to directly assess the effect of antiarrhythmic agents on junctional resistance between two isolated cells using the double whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The experimental protocol consisted in holding the membrane potential of each guinea pig ventricular myocyte of a coupled cell pair at 0 mV. Then, a junctional voltage gradient was created by changing membrane potential in only one cell. Voltage gradients were varied between -50 to +50 mV in steps of 20 mV. The extracellular medium was set to minimize trans-sarcolemmal currents and the junctional current was recorded in the cell maintained at 0 mV. Drugs tested were quinidine, lidocaine, procainamide, flecainide, propranolol, sotalol, amiodarone and verapamil. Drugs were superfused after a control period of 5 min. during which junctional resistance was observed to be stable. None of the antiarrhythmic agents tested in this study directly affected junctional resistance, although procainamide slightly increased junctional resistance 110 +/- 8% after 10 min of exposure. In conclusion, drugs tested in this study, chosen among all classes of antiarrhythmic agents, did not affect junctional resistance of cardiac myocyte cell pairs. However, long-term modulation or indirect effects of antiarrhythmic agents on gap junctions under physiological conditions cannot be excluded.

TI  - Switch of phenotype as an escape mechanism of the intruder.  
AB  - Phenotypic switching in Candida albicans is a reversible, high-frequency phenomenon that is readily detectable in a fungal population as changes in cell or colony morphology. Some putative attributes of virulence in C. albicans, including expression of cell wall glycoproteins, secretion of proteolytic enzymes and hypha formation have been associated with switching phenomena. C. albicans isolates from active infection tend to show a higher prevalence of phenotypic switching than those associated with commensalism. Moreover, some characteristics of azole resistance in C. albicans are compatible with a switch of phenotype. There is thus a preliminary basis of scientific evidence for a hypothesis that phenotypic switching may indeed serve as an attribute of virulence in at least one pathogenic fungus, facilitating invasion and escape from host defences.

TI  - Penciclovir and pathogenesis phenotypes of drug-resistant Herpes simplex virus mutants.  
AB  - We compared the penciclovir susceptibilities and pathogenesis phenotypes of mutants of Herpes simplex virus type 1 that are resistant to acyclovir and/or foscarnet. The mutants, which were derived from laboratory strain KOS, included six DNA polymerase mutants, a thymidine kinase negative mutant, a thymidine kinase partial mutant, and a double mutant. Two of four polymerase mutants not previously examined for penciclovir susceptibility exhibited modest resistance to this drug. A thymidine kinase negative mutant exhibited approximately 20-fold resistance while a thymidine kinase partial mutant was penciclovir-sensitive. Following intracerebral inoculation of 7-week old CD1 mice, the mutants ranged from exhibiting near wild-type neurovirulence (thymidine kinase partial) to modest attenuation (e.g. thymidine kinase negative) to more severe attenuation. Following corneal inoculation, three polymerase mutants exhibited modest deficits (relative to those of thymidine kinase negative mutants) in their abilities to replicate acutely in the ganglion and reactivate from latency. For mutant AraA(r)13, the deficit in ganglionic replication was shown to be due to its polymerase mutation by analysis of recombinant viruses derived by marker rescue. These results may have implications for issues of penciclovir action and resistance, for drug resistance in the clinic, and for the interactions of herpes viruses with the peripheral and central nervous systems.

TI  - Bromocriptine modulates P-glycoprotein function.  
AB  - The multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane transporter which carries, at the expense of MgATP hydrolysis, many amphiphilic molecules, such as the MDR-related cytotoxic drugs vincristine and vinblastine, and the MDR-reversing agents verapamil and progesterone. We have tested the effects on P-gp function of bromocriptine (BCT), an ergot alkaloid known as a D2 dopaminergic receptor agonist. BCT (at 4 microM) partially reverses the P-gp-mediated vincristine resistance of the Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts DC-3F/ADX, a MDR cell line. P-gp containing membrane vesicles prepared from the DC-3F/ADX cells exhibit, in the absence of any added drug, a basal MgATPase activity due to P-gp. BCT inhibits this basal ATPase activity, with a half-inhibiting concentration of 0.30 +/- 0.15 microM. BCT also inhibits the verapamil-induced P-gp ATPase stimulation competitively (Ki approximately 0.2 microM), and the progesterone-induced P-gp ATPase stimulation non-competitively (Ki approximately 0.07-0.10 microM). BCT also non-competitively inhibits the vinblastine-dependent P-gp ATPase activity within the same concentration range. Hydroxylated metabolites of BCT have different effects on P-gp ATPase, only the monohydroxylated being able to modulate both the basal and the drug-stimulated ATPase activities. In conclusion, these effects of BCT on P-gp function can be linked to a specific interaction with P-gp, probably involving inhibition of P-gp-mediated drug transport.

TI  - Fetal heart modelling based on a pressure-volume relationship.  
AB  - Study of the cardiovascular system of the human fetus is based on non-invasive measurement methods such as Doppler echography systems. The circulation conditions in fetal vessels are usually evaluated by resistance indices, giving limited physiological information on distal territories such as the placenta or the brain. To enhance the understanding of human fetal haemodynamics, a numerical model of the fetal heart has been developed, using the hydraulic-electric analogy. The model is based on a mechanical hypothesis of parallel functioning of the right and left ventricles, considered to have analogue elastance properties. Their behaviour is equivalent to that of a single ventricle ejecting an equivalent blood volume of 7 ml in the aorta. The characterisation of the equivalent ventricle is based on the determination of a set of four parameters (Emax, Vo, kv and Po) representing the maximum ventricle contractility, a reference volume, and volume and pressure constants, respectively. The model proposed is validated by studying the effects of preload and afterload variations on the fetal heart work, and by comparing the numerical results with literature and measured data. The model constitutes the first step towards a global model of the cardiovascular system of the human fetus.

TI  - Overexpression of both p185c-erbB2 and p170mdr-1 renders breast cancer cells highly resistant to taxol.  
AB  - We recently found that overexpression of p185c-erbB2 in c-erbB2 transfected MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells (435.eB transfectants) confers a 5-9-fold increase in Taxol resistance. To examine whether Taxol resistance is a common phenomenon in other c-erbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, we tested a panel of human breast cancer cell lines established from different patients and expressing pl85c-erbB2 at different levels for their sensitivity to Taxol and Taxotere, a synthetic taxoid. Higher expression of p185c-erbB2 in these breast cancer cell lines indeed correlated well with resistance to Taxol and Taxotere, and the degree of resistance was about 100-fold that in c-erbB2-overexpressing 435.eB transfectants, demonstrating that these breast cancer cells are highly resistant to Taxol. Since mdr-1-encoded p-glycoprotein (p170mdr-1) has been implicated in Taxol resistance, we next examined the p170mdr-1 levels in these breast cancer cell lines that are highly resistant to Taxol. Higher levels of p170mdr-1 expression were found in several breast cancer cell lines that are highly resistant to Taxol. Since these same breast cancer cell lines also expressed higher levels of p185c-erbB2, we sought to determine the relative contribution of p185c-erbB2 and p170mdr-1 overexpression to Taxol resistance. We first specifically down-regulated cell surface p185c-erbB2 using anti-p185c-erbB2 monoclonal antibodies and assayed sensitivity of these cells to Taxol. We next specifically inactivated p170mdr-1 function using p170mdr-1 blockers (thioridazine or verapamil) and again assayed Taxol sensitivity. Both p185c-erbB2 down-regulation and p170mdr-1 blockade significantly sensitized the breast cancer cell lines to Taxol. The results indicate that overexpression of either p185c-erbB2 or p170mdr-1 renders human breast cancer cells resistant to Taxol. Furthermore, p185c-erbB2 synergizes with p170mdr-1 conferring higher degrees of Taxol resistance. Finally, combination therapy (down-regulation of p185c-erbB2 plus blocking p170mdr-1 plus administration of Taxol) may be beneficial to breast cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of both p185c-erbB2 and p170mdr-1.

TI  - Validation of a frequency-weighted filter for continuous biomechanical stress in repetitive wrist flexion tasks against a load.  
AB  - This experiment validates a frequency-weighted filter for continuous measurements of force, posture and repetition using a stimulated industrial task. A peg transfer task was used requiring subjects to repetitively insert pegs into holes with controlled resistance. Ten subjects performed the task for six conditions. All wrist flexion angular data were recorded continually using an electrogoniometer and processed through the filter. Subjective discomfort was reported after performing the task for 1 h using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Results from linear regression analysis showed that the instrument reliably estimated subjective discomfort (r2 = 0.873). Applications and limitations of this instrument are explored.

TI  - Efficient transduction of human hematopoietic cells with the human multidrug resistance gene 1 via SV40 pseudovirions [see comments]  
AB  - Transduction of MDR1 may be of use in chemoprotection of normal bone marrow (BM) cells during treatment of malignancies, or as a selectable marker for the transfer of other genes into the BM, a critical target for the cure of many diseases. To that aim, the human multidrug resistance gene MDR1 was cloned into an SV40 pseudoviral vector containing the SV40 origin of replication (ori) and encapsidation signal (ses), and the plasmid was encapsidated in COS cells as SV40/MDR1 pseudovirions. Expression of the human MDR1 gene was demonstrated in murine MEL cells infected with SV40/MDR1 pseudovirions, using a monoclonal antibody (MPK16) specific for the human 170-kD P-glycoprotein. Functional P-glycoprotein was demonstrated by resistance to colchicine in NIH-3T3 cells infected with SV40/MDR1 pseudovirions. Activity of P-glycoprotein was assayed by rhodamine-123 dye exclusion and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS) in various cell types including hematopoietic cells. Highly efficient gene transfer and expression was demonstrated in all murine and human cell types tested, including primary human BM cells. Using multiplicities of infection (moi) of 1-2, over 95% of cells were found to become MDR1+. The percent of MDR1+ cells was proportional to the moi. We conclude that the SV40 pseudoviral vector is efficient for gene transmission into human hematopoietic cells.

TI  - Transvaginal ultrasonography combined with color velocity imaging and pulsed Doppler to detect residual trophoblastic tissue.  
AB  - The value of transvaginal B-mode ultrasonography combined with color velocity imaging and pulsed Doppler to detect retained trophoblastic tissue was evaluated prospectively in a series of 40 patients with postpartum (n = 15) or postabortion (n = 25) bleeding. Color velocity imaging was used to identify color-coded blood flow signals within myometrium and/or endometrium. Flow was subjectively quantified as absent, scanty or abundant. Pulsed Doppler was used to assess blood flow impedance by calculating the resistance index. The presence of abundant flow with a lowest resistance index of less than 0.45 was considered as suspicious of residual trophoblastic tissue. Twenty-two (55%) out of the 40 patients underwent dilatation and curettage and chorionic villi were demonstrated in 15 of these. Eighteen (45%) patients were managed conservatively. None of these patients suffered complications or needed readmission for curettage, and all of them were considered as not having retained tissue. On color pulsed Doppler ultrasound examination, 15 patients had suspected retained tissue; all of these underwent curettage and residual trophoblast was found in 14 (93.3%). Out of 25 patients considered as having no residual tissue on color pulsed Doppler ultrasound examination, seven underwent curettage and chorionic villi were found in one patient (false-negative rate 6.7%) All patients managed conservatively had an unsuspicious scan. We concluded that transvaginal ultrasonography combined with color velocity imaging and pulsed Doppler could be useful to detect retained trophoblastic tissue and to select patients suitable for conservative management.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction viraemia in patients receiving ganciclovir maintenance therapy for retinitis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether recurrence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viraemia during maintenance ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis correlates with (i) CMV disease at a new anatomical site, (ii) progression of the presenting retinitis, or (iii) acquisition of genetic changes in gene UL97 associated with resistance to ganciclovir. DESIGN: A previously described cohort of 45 patients presenting with first episode retinitis was followed clinically using ophthalmoscopy and serial tests for PCR viraemia for a median of 7 months. CMV viral load and genetic markers of ganciclovir resistance were measured in PCR-positive samples. METHODS: PCR amplification of the glycoprotein B region of CMV and quantitative competitive PCR assays were employed. Genetic changes in UL97 were identified by sequencing/point mutation assay. RESULTS: PCR viraemia correlated significantly with new episodes of CMV disease (P=0.011) and a trend was seen for the association with progression of retinitis (P=0.07). Amongst the 14 patients PCR-positive during maintenance ganciclovir, 10 (71%) had genetic markers of resistance. None of these patients became PCR-negative in blood after reinduction ganciclovir therapy compared with three out of four without markers of resistance (P=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: CMV PCR viraemia correlated strongly with the development of new episodes of CMV disease. Most patients with progression of retinitis remained PCR-negative in blood, consistent with therapeutic failure due to poor intraocular penetration of ganciclovir. However, the minority who were PCR-positive in blood may have reinfected their eye, and frequently had markers of ganciclovir resistance. The implications of these findings for the management of patients with CMV disease are discussed.

TI  - Tubuloglomerular feedback and prolonged ACE-inhibitor treatment in the hypertensive fawn-hooded rat.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spontaneously hypertensive fawn-hooded (FHH) rat develops severe glomerulosclerosis with ageing. The afferent arteriolar resistance is low, resulting in a strongly elevated glomerular capillary pressure (P(GC)). METHODS: Afferent arteriolar resistance is under the control of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system, and we studied whether young FHH rats, i.e. at a stage when only mild glomerulosclerosis was present, have diminished TGF responsiveness. RESULTS: Maximum TGF-mediated decreases in stop-flow pressure in response to late proximal perfusion with artificial tubular fluid were 9.0 +/- 1.0 mmHg, a value not different or even slightly lower than observed in normal rats. P(GC) was 59.9 +/- 1.2 mmHg and the estimated P(GC) at half-maximal activation of the TGF system (operating P(GC)) was 54.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg at 11 weeks of age (n = 11), a value higher than observed in normal rats. The second question of the present study concerns the effect of chronic angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) administration on P(GC). ACE-i, by reducing angiotensin II (Ang II) availability, diminishes TGF responsiveness, which would offset the beneficial effect on P(GC) under normal flow conditions to the macula densa. Maximum TGF responses were 8.9 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg in 11- and 26-week-old rats that had been treated with the ACE-i lisinopril in the drinking water started when the animals were 7 weeks of age. P(GC) was 44.3 +/- 1.2 (n = 9) and operating P(GC) was 40.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg (n = 9) at 11, values significantly lower than in untreated rats. Values remained lower in the 26-week-old treated animals and were 40.9 +/- 0.8 and 32.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: (1) the TGF system in this model of spontaneous hypertension and glomerulosclerosis is intact, despite the fact that the FHH rat has a characteristically low afferent arteriolar resistance as compared to other hypertensive rats; (2) the rat displays a normal or even enhanced function of the TGF system following prolonged administration of the ACE-i lisinopril. The latter finding indicates that the reduction of P(GC) achieved by the ACE-i is not offset by a concomitant attenuation of TGF function.

TI  -  Severe leptin resistance in brown fat-deficient uncoupling protein promoter-driven diphtheria toxin A mice despite suppression of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and circulating corticosterone concentrations [published erratum appears in Diabetes 1998 May;47(5):855]  
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has the capacity for uncoupled mitochondrial respiration and is proposed to be a key site for regulating energy expenditure in rodents. To better define the role of BAT in energy homeostasis, we previously created a line of transgenic mice with deficiency of BAT (UCP promoter-driven diphtheria toxin A transgenic mice [UCP-DTA]) mice. These mice develop obesity that initially is due to decreased energy expenditure and later accompanied by hyperphagia despite increased levels of circulating leptin. In addition, the obesity of these mice is accompanied by severe insulin-resistant diabetes and hyperlipidemia. To better define the basis for leptin resistance in this model, we treated UCP-DTA mice with leptin (300 microg i.p., b.i.d.) and compared their response with that of leptin-treated ob/ob and FVB control mice (30 microg i.p., b.i.d.). Leptin treatment of FVB and ob/ob mice decreased their body weight and food intake and improved their glucose homeostasis. In contrast, tenfold higher dosages of leptin had no effect on body weight, food intake, or circulating insulin or glucose concentrations of UCP-DTA mice. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression was lower in UCP-DTA mice than in littermate control FVB mice in the fed state, and increased progressively in response to food restriction as leptin levels fell. In parallel to the levels of hypothalamic NPY, corticosterone levels were initially suppressed and rose with food restriction. Thus food intake, body weight, and insulin and glucose homeostasis of UCP-DTA mice are all extraordinarily resistant to leptin, whereas hypothalamic NPY and the hypothalamopituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may remain under leptin control. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying leptin resistance in UCP-DTA mice may provide valuable insights into the basis for leptin resistance in human obesity.

TI  - Resistance exercise prevents glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in heart transplant recipients.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of resistance exercise training (ET) on glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in heart transplant recipients (HTR), 14 male HTR were randomly assigned to a ET group that trained for 6 months (54 +/- 3 yr old; mean +/- SD) or a control group (51 +/- 8 yr old; mean +/- SD). METHODS: Fat mass, fat-free mass, and total body mass were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry before and 2 months after transplantation (Tx), and after 3 and 6 months of ET or control period. The exercise regimen consisted of lumbar extension (MedX) performed 1 d.wk-1 and variable resistance exercises (Nautilus) performed 2 d.wk-1. PreTx body composition did not differ between groups. RESULTS: At 2 months after Tx, fat-free mass was significantly decreased below baseline in both control (-3.4 +/- 2.1%) and ET groups (-4.3 +/- 2.4%). Fat mass was significantly increased at 2 months after Tx in both the control (+8.3 +/- 2.8%) and ET groups (+7.3 +/- 4.0%). Six months of ET restored fat-free mass to levels 3.9 +/- 2.1% greater (P < or = 0.05) than before Tx. Fat-free mass of the control group decreased progressively to levels that were 7 +/- 4.4% lower than preTx values (P < or = 0.05). Both groups increased knee extension, chest press, and lumbar extensor strength, but improvements in the ET group were four- to six-fold greater (P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that glucocorticoid-induced changes in body composition in HTR occur early after Tx. However, 6 months of specific ET restores fat-free mass to levels greater than before Tx and dramatically increases skeletal muscle strength. Resistance exercise, as part of a strategy to prevent steroid-induced myopathy, appears to be safe and should be initiated early after heart Tx.

Here we describe the cytotoxic response and the mutagenic response at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus to the S(N)2 alkylating agent methyl methanesultfonate (MMS) in human cancer cell lines defective in mismatch repair (MMR). Our findings suggest that cytotoxicity to MMS is mediated through MMR, as indicated by an increased resistance to MMS in MMR-deficient cells. Cells in which specific MMR-gene defects were complemented by chromosome transfer were generally more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of MMS. Additionally, the induced mutant frequency at HPRT following exposure to MMS is significantly increased in MMR-deficient lines. These findings suggest that resistance to S(N)2 alkylation damage is mediated by MMR genes, and that resistance to such damage in MMR-defective cells correlates with an increase in genomic mutations. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that abasic sites may be substrates for repair involving MMR-gene products in human cells.

TI  - The modulating effect of PSC 833, cyclosporin A, verapamil and genistein on in vitro cytotoxicity and intracellular content of daunorubicin in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  
AB  - Resistance to anthracyclines is related to a poor prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Resistance to this class of drugs may (partly) be reversed by modulating agents, as has been demonstrated in a variety of cell lines. However, it is unknown which modulators may be of clinical benefit in childhood ALL. Therefore, we studied the modulating effect of PSC 833, cyclosporin A (CsA), verapamil (Vp) and genistein on daunorubicin (DNR) cytotoxicity, accumulation and retention in childhood ALL cells. DNR cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay; DNR accumulation, DNR retention and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and major vault protein/lung resistance protein (LRP) were determined by flow cytometry. In the majority of samples PSC 833 (19/26), CsA (22/26) and Vp (15/18) sensitized the cells to DNR whereas genistein made 25 out of 26 samples more resistant to DNR. The sensitizing effect on the cytotoxicity of DNR was median 1.2-fold using 2 microM PSC 833 (P = 0.025), 1.5-fold using 4 microM CsA (P = 0.003) and 1.6-fold using 6 microM Vp (P = 0.012) whereas the adverse effect of 25 microM genistein was median 1.8-fold (P < 0.0001). No relationship was found between the sensitizing effect of PSC 833, CsA or Vp and the degree of DNR resistance. In contrast, the adverse effect of genistein was largest in DNR sensitive samples (P = 0.003). The effect of each modulator on the cytotoxicity of DNR did not differ between initial and relapse ALL samples although the latter were median 1.4-fold more resistant to DNR (P = 0.005). Modulation of DNR cytotoxicity was not correlated with changes in the accumulated and retained intracellular DNR content or with the expression of P-gp, MRP and LRP. Besides genistein, PSC 833, CsA and Vp incidentally made ALL cells more resistant to DNR. CsA stimulated the leukemic cell survival in seven out of 26 samples, a phenomenon that was not related to the degree of DNR resistance. In conclusion, PSC 833, CsA and Vp but not genistein may be used to sensitize cells to DNR in childhood ALL. The data also indicate that not all patients may have a therapeutic benefit from these modulators. Therefore, an in vitro culture assay may be necessary to screen for patients who may benefit by a modulator in their therapy.

TI  - Tm-2(2) resistance in tomato requires recognition of the carboxy terminus of the movement protein of tomato mosaic virus.  
AB  - The Tm-2(2) resistance gene is used in most commercial tomato cultivars for protection against infection with tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). It has been suggested that Tm-2(2) resistance interferes with viral cell-to-cell movement in plants; ToMV strain ToMV-2(2) requires two amino acid (aa) exchanges in the carboxy-terminal region of the viral 30-kDa movement protein (at positions 238 and 244) to overcome Tm-2(2) resistance. For further analysis of this region of the 30-kDa protein, two stop codons were introduced into ToMV movement proteins at aa positions 235 and 237, leading to deletion of the terminal 30 aa. The mutant virus strains were able to infect wild-type tomato plants systemically, suggesting the carboxy-terminal portion of the ToMV 30-kDa protein is dispensable for virus transport in tomato. Even more important, the deletion mutants overcame the Tm-2(2) resistance gene. These data indicate the carboxy-terminal domain of the ToMV movement protein serves as a recognition target in the context of the Tm-2(2) resistance gene. Furthermore, expression of the 30-kDa movement protein from wild-type ToMV, but not from ToMV-2(2), in transgenic tomato plants with the Tm-2(2) resistance gene led to elicitation of a necrotic reaction in tomato seedlings, showing that the 30-kDa protein on its own is able to induce the plant's defense reaction.

PMID- 9629304
TI  -  Host resistance to mycobacteria is compromised by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  
AB  - Host resistance to the growth of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is controlled by a gene, termed Nramp1, that maps to chromosome 1 in mice. Activation of the HPA axis or treatment of macrophages from susceptible mice with corticosterone suppresses the expression of Nramp1 mRNA and results in an increased susceptibility to mycobacterial growth. In contrast, neither activation of the HPA axis nor treatment of macrophages from resistant mice with corticosterone results in an alteration in their resistance or suppression of Nramp1 expression. Investigation into the mechanism of the differential response of the macrophages to corticosterone indicated that differences were associated with the stability of the mRNA in macrophages from BCG-resistant mice. Thus, corticosterone induced the accelerated degradation of Nramp1 mRNA as well as mRNA of several other macrophage activation genes in macrophages from BCG-susceptible mice. Treatment of macrophages with corticosterone before the induction of Nramp1 resulted in the accelerated degradation of mRNA in macrophages from both resistant and susceptible mice. The Nramp1 gene product appears to protect the mRNA of macrophage activation genes from degradation induced by corticosterone by an iron-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Low-level resistance to camptothecin in a human small-cell lung cancer cell line without reduction in DNA topoisomerase I or drug-induced cleavable complex formation.  
AB  - To study the evolution of camptothecin (CPT) resistance, we have established two small-cell lung cancer cell lines with low (3.2-fold, NYH/CAM15) and high (18-fold, NYH/CAM50) resistance to CPT by stepwise drug exposure. NYH/CAM50 cells had reduced topoisomerase I (topo I) content and activity, and consequently CPT-induced DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) were reduced, as measured by alkaline elution. In contrast, NYH/CAM15 cells had identical topo I content and activity as compared with wild-type (wt) cells. CPT-mediated SSBs and the rate of their reversal after drug removal were also equal in wt and NYH/CAM15 cells, as were doubling time, the fraction of cells in S-phase and DNA synthesis rate in response to CPT. As the conversion of DNA SSBs to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is thought to represent a critical event leading to cell death, we measured DNA DSBs by neutral elution. In contrast to DNA SSBs, CPT induced fewer DNA DSBs in NYH/CAM15 than in wt cells. DNA flow cytometry showed that, in CPT-treated cells, the G1 phase was emptied as cells accumulated in late S- and G2M phase. A Spearman rank correlation showed that depletion of G1 and accumulation in late S and G2M correlated to CPT sensitivity in these three cell lines. In conclusion, acquired resistance to CPT can occur without a reduction in either topo I enzyme or CPT-induced cleavable complex formation, while a decrease in the level of CPT-induced DNA DSBs may be of major importance in the early stages of CPT resistance.

TI  - Pharmacologic management of periodontal diseases using systemically administered agents.  
AB  - Since the establishment of bacteria-laden plaque as a causative agent in gingivitis, the search for specific bacteria that induce different types of periodontitis has generated extensive research. In contrast to many other microbial-induced disorders, the specific periodontal pathogen(s) has not been identified to date. Therefore, the search for an effective systemic agent to prevent the loss of attachment through the selective reduction of known periodontal pathogens has remained elusive. It is not surprising then that antibiotics are not used solely to manage periodontal diseases but rather as an adjunct to the mechanical debridement of root surfaces in select periodontal diseases. Further, the sole use of antibiotics in patients with adult periodontitis (or those who exhibit signs of inflammation but are periodontally stable) has shown little benefit and only increases the chance of microbial resistance to antibiotics. Despite these limitations, considerable progress in antibiotic therapy has delivered regimens that enhance the effectiveness of conventional therapy. In contrast to traditional antimicrobial therapy, new treatment modalities have begun to focus on modulating the responses of host cells to bacteria rather than modulating only the bacteria. Current drugs used to regulate host cells inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway, reduce the activity of metalloproteinases, or inactivate bone resorptive cells (see Table 1). Although these drugs offer great potential to modulate a variety of mammalian cells, a notable and consequential limitation of these agents is a lack of specificity. Inflammation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue metabolism are two-edged swords; all are necessary for the homeostasis of the tissue, but some or all may also be involved in the pathologic destruction of that same tissue. Hence, drugs that inhibit destruction of the connective tissue in one site of the periodontium also interfere with wound healing at another. As a result of these limitations, the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the long-term use of these agents is unknown. Preliminary results of treatment with these drugs are promising, and future generations of host-modulating drugs will provide clinicians with additional agents to help improve the success rate of periodontal treatment for patients. Antibiotics remain an important adjunctive therapy in the treatment of periodontal diseases, and the use of host modulating drugs as supplemental agents in the management of periodontal diseases continues to grow. As more knowledge is gained about the causes of periodontal diseases, new drugs that are potent, effective, site specific, and safe can be delivered at optimal times by simply having the patient take a few tablets. Considering the dramatic progress in the past decade in understanding the cause and pharmacologic management of periodontal diseases, the twenty-first century holds great promise for the development of magic bullets.

AB  - A prospective study was undertaken to observe the emergence of resistance to imipenem, if any, among aerobic gram-negative bacteria. A total of 736 isolates were tested during 1994-95 and less than 1% of them were resistant to imipenem, whereas the next year ('95-'96) the rate increased to 11 of the 903 isolates tested. The resistant isolates during '94-'95 were all Stenotrophomonas maltophilia whereas the spectrum of resistant bacterial species increased in '95-'96 to include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii with a tendency to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the later part of the year. A majority (72%) of the resistant isolates were from patients with burns, and burn wounds were most frequently infected with such organisms. These data suggest that over a period of time aerobic gram-negative bacteria may develop resistance to imipenem and the pool of such bacteria increases with extensive use of the drug. Non-fermentative aerobic bacteria tend to develop resistance faster with widespread dissemination than Enterobacteriaceae. Hospital Burn Units are a potential source of development of such resistance.

TI  - Transduction of antibiotic resistance including imipenem resistance by wild type phages from nosocomial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  
AB  - In this report we describe transduction of antibiotic resistance determinants by three wild type bacteriophages isolated from three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The strains showed evident plaques of a lysis caused by a bacteriophage. The strains were identified as lysogenic among 31 imipenem (IMP)-resistant P. aeruginosa strains isolated at the National Institute of Oncology in Bratislava. The carbenicillin (CAR) resistance determinant was transduced by all the three phages to four P. aeruginosa recipients-PAO-1670, ML-M-88, ML-1292 and ML-1008. The gentamicin (GEN) resistance was transduced to ML-1008 only. The kanamycin (KAN) resistance was transduced in the following systems (combinations): "phage AP-37 to M-88", "phage AP-38 to PAO-1670, ML-1292 and M-88", and "phage AP-40 to M-88".  The IMP resistance determinant was transduced by all the three phages to P. aeruginosa recipient strains. All transductant colonies were tested for the presence of directly not selected but co-transduced resistance determinants. Whereas transductants selected on media with IMP were resistant to five antibiotics (IMP, CAR, streptomycin (STR), KAN and GEN), transductants selected on CAR, KAN, STR, or GEN were resistant to a block of four of these antibiotics but not to IMP.

TI  - An RGD-oligolysine peptide: a prototype construct for integrin-mediated gene delivery [see comments]  
AB  - We have synthesized a linear, bifunctional peptide that comprises an integrin-targeting domain containing an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide motif and a DNA-binding moiety consisting of a short stretch of 16 lysine residues. This peptide can form distinctive, condensed complexes with DNA and is capable of mediating its delivery and expression in a variety of mammalian cells in culture. Internalization is mediated by cell surface integrin receptors via a mechanism that is known to be phagocytic. We have analyzed the relationship between DNA and peptide and have investigated the conditions suitable for optimal gene delivery. The formation of condensed peptide DNA complexes leads to resistance to nuclease degradation. The level of reporter gene expression obtained is dependent on the peptide-to-DNA ratio and is enhanced in the presence of the endosomal buffer chloroquine, polyethyleneimine, and deactivated adenovirus during gene delivery. Under optimal conditions the levels of reporter gene expression obtained approach or even exceed those obtained with DNA delivered with the commercial liposome Lipofectamine. The ability to produce an efficient gene delivery system using small, easily modified, and well-defined constructs that have no constraint of particle size demonstrates the advantages of integrin-targeting peptides for gene transfer.

TI  - Mechanisms of resistance of HIV-1 primary isolates to complement-mediated lysis.  
AB  - Previous studies suggested that HIV-1 primary isolates (PI) were resistant to complement-mediated lysis (CML), while virus produced in certain T cell lines and virus taken directly from the plasma of HIV+ persons were both susceptible to CML. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) of PI resistance. PI were resistant to CML using pooled seropositive serum as an antibody source. Additionally, PI obtained from two patients at several times over 2 years were resistant to CML using autologous antibody. PI were also resistant to CML induced by monoclonal antibodies which neutralize a broad range of PI. Resistance to CML was associated with low binding of antibody to PI but was not due to low gp120 levels. Cell-line-derived virus and PI were equally sensitive to CML induced by antibody to host-cell proteins, suggesting that PBMC do not contribute properties to virions which make them more physically resistant to CML in general but that PI resistance is restricted to CML induced by antiviral antibody. These studies show that PI are resistant to CML mediated by various antiviral antibodies and indicate that low binding of antibody to virus is an important factor contributing to resistance.

TI  - Age-dependent characteristics of protection v. susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum.  
AB  - Naturally acquired immunity to Plasmodium falciparum may be linked to key features of the immune system that change during normal development and ageing. Evidence of this was seen in non-immune Javanese transmigrants taking up residence in hyperendemic Irian Jaya, Indonesia. After 1-2 years of residence, the adult migrants had less frequent and less intense parasitaemias than their children. Splenomegaly and malaria-like symptoms were also less common in the adults. These age-dependent patterns of relative resistance to P. falciparum mirrored those in lifelong residents. The Javanese adults acquired protective immunity against chronic exposure to infection relatively quickly compared with their children. However, during the initial exposure to infection, the incidence of emergency medical evacuation to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of malaria was 7-fold higher among the adults than in their children. The exaggerated susceptibility of adults to severe morbidity and mortality has been reported in other populations during initial exposure to infection. Thus, whereas adults acquired protection against chronic exposure more rapidly than the children, they were initially more susceptible to severe disease. One possible explanation for these findings is the changes in the immune system that normally occur during ageing. Such changes may establish differences between children and adults that profoundly affect the course of infection by P. falciparum. The ratio of naive to memory T cells gradually diminishes during ageing, as a result of the cumulative effect of exposure to the myriad antigens encountered throughout the normal course of life. Moreover, the gradual involution of the thymus progressively limits the production of naive T cells. The likelihood of stimulating memory T cells with cross-reactive antigens may increase with age and this may bias the immune response to the relative benefits of the host under chronic exposure, or to the detriment of the host under acute exposure. Intrinsic features of the immune system that change with age may determine key characteristics of the immune response to infection by P. falciparum, and whether that response is relatively harmful or beneficial may depend upon the conditions of exposure (i.e. acute or chronic).

TI  -  Resistance to fracture of crowned teeth restored with different post systems.  
AB  - This study examined the effect of four different post systems, Cast Post, Para Post, Flexi-post and Fil Post, on the fracture resistance of crowned endodontically treated teeth. The Flexi-post and Para Post groups showed significantly higher resistance to fracture than the others. Horizontal root fractures were seen in the prefabricated post groups compared with vertical root fractures in the Cast Post group. Findings of this study suggest that the choice of prefabricated post systems is important in determining maximum resistance to fracture in teeth that have been endodontically treated.

TI  - The emergence of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in Japan.  
AB  - Within the past year, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC=8 microg/mL) have been reported in both Japan and the United States. The emergence of these strains poses a potentially serious threat to public health. After 2 such strains (Mu3 and Mu50) were identified at Juntendo Hospital in 1996, a screening program to identify MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was initiated. Of 970 MRSA strains tested at 195 nonuniversity hospitals throughout Japan, 13 (1.3%) were found to have subpopulations with reduced vancomycin susceptibility (heterogeneous vancomycin resistance). Among 129 MRSA strains identified at 7 university hospitals, 12 (9.3%) demonstrated heterogeneity for vancomycin resistance; 1 of these strains had a vancomycin MIC of 7 microg/mL. Although resistance in these strains is not the result of the transfer of enterococcal vancomycin resistance genes (vanA or vanB), the clonal dissemination of MRSA strains with vancomycin-resistant subpopulations is obviously undesirable. Intensified testing of MRSA strains for resistance to vancomycin and appropriate measures for the prevention of the spread of such strains are recommended.

TI  - Flow resistance and drag forces due to multiple adherent leukocytes in postcapillary vessels.  
AB  - Computational fluid dynamics was used to model flow past multiple adherent leukocytes in postcapillary size vessels. A finite-element package was used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flow of a Newtonian fluid past spheres adhering to the wall of a cylindrical vessel. We determined the effects of sphere number, relative geometry, and spacing on the flow resistance in the vessel and the fluid flow drag force acting to sweep the sphere off the vessel wall. The computations show that when adherent leukocytes are aligned on the same side of the vessel, the drag force on each of the interacting leukocytes is less than the drag force on an isolated adherent leukocyte and can decrease by up to 50%. The magnitude of the reduction depends on the ratio of leukocyte to blood vessel diameter and distance between adherent leukocytes. However, there is an increase in the drag force when leukocytes adhere to opposite sides of the vessel wall. The increase in resistance generated by adherent leukocytes in vessels of various sizes is calculated from the computational results. The resistance increases with decreasing vessel size and is most pronounced when leukocytes adhere to opposite sides of the vessel.

TI  - Site-specific mutations in the 23S rRNA gene of Helicobacter pylori confer two types of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics.  
AB  - Clarithromycin resistance in Helicobacter pylori is mainly due to A-to-G mutations within the peptidyltransferase region of the 23S rRNA. In the present study, cross-resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics (MLS phenotypes) has been investigated for several clinical isolates of H. pylori. Two major types of MLS resistance were identified and correlated with specific point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. The A2142G mutation was linked with high-level cross-resistance to all MLS antibiotics (type I), and the A2143G mutation gave rise to an intermediate level of resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin but no resistance to streptogramin B (type II). In addition, streptogramin A and streptogramin B were demonstrated to have a synergistic effect on both MLS-sensitive and MLS-resistant H. pylori strains. To further understand the mechanism of MLS resistance in H. pylori, we performed in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (substitution of G, C, or T for A at either position 2142 or 2143 of the 23S rRNA gene). The site-directed point mutations were introduced into a clarithromycin-susceptible strain, H. pylori UA802, by natural transformation followed by characterization of their effects on MLS resistance in an isogenic background. Strains with A-to-G and A-to-C mutations at the same position within the 23S rRNA gene had similar levels of clarithromycin resistance, and this level of resistance was higher than that for strains with the A-to-T mutation. Mutations at position 2142 conferred a higher level of clarithromycin resistance than mutations at position 2143. All mutations at position 2142 conferred cross-resistance to all MLS antibiotics, which corresponds to the type I MLS phenotype, whereas mutations at position 2143 were associated with a type II MLS phenotype with no resistance to streptogramin B. To explain that A-to-G transitions were predominantly observed in clarithromycin-resistant clinical isolates, we propose a possible mechanism by which A-to-G mutations are preferentially produced in H. pylori.

TI  - Implementation of quality improvement methodology and the medical profession.  
AB  - Modern quality management (QM) has evolved in industry over the last few decades to be a major factor in organizational structure and focus. The health industry has to a degree recognized or perceived merits in this model and has applied the principles of QM to many of its activities. It has also incorporated the concept of a commitment to quality improvement (QI) into its most recognized peer-review structure, hospital accreditation (ACHS).  Apparent resistance exists in the medical fraternity to a transition from audit-focused quality assurance to contemporary systematic QI. An understanding of this issue may be gained from analysis of the medical profession's perception of QI, factors in the historical structures within health, and a review of the factors which hinder the transition to QI. By considering within a framework of organisational behaviour theory (OBT), some key concepts it is possible to work towards some solutions and proposals. These concepts include attitude, motivation, conflict, organizational change and development. It is likely that the appropriate focus should be broader than the 'recalcitrant group of conservative practitioners who resist change'. Indeed where a deficiency exists, QI methodology would have us look beyond an individual or single group towards the processes that create the opportunity for deficiency to occur. Within the current context, such processes are inherently structural and are historically established within the health industry. A solution to this problem requires organizational commitment and a period of analysis as well as the transformation of attitudes and practices. Organizational commitment will take the form of adequate resourcing and a developmental approach to organizational change. Internal professional change (perhaps guided by organizational development) must address the interface between the 'medical profession' and the broader group of professional health-care providers.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of loss of beta 2-microglobulin expression in drug-resistant breast cancer sublines and its involvement in drug resistance.  
AB  - In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the loss or decreased expression of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in several drug-resistant sublines of MCF-7 and in a doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant variant of the T-47D breast cancer cell line. beta 2m protein and RNA are not expressed in highly metastatic, multidrug-resistant MCF-7/Adr cells with high resistance to DOX. Nuclear run-on transcription and RNA stability assays demonstrate that while beta 2m in MCF-7/Adr cells is transcribed, its mRNA is rapidly degraded after synthesis in these cells, indicating that it is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. We also show that an MCF-7 subline (MCF-7/Adr-5) expressing a very low level of resistance to DOX has a decreased level of beta 2m expression. Treatment with actinomycin D revealed that the half-life of beta 2m mRNA in MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr-5 cell lines was comparable. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis revealed a decreased rate of beta2m transcription in MCF-7/Adr-5 cells compared to that in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, beta 2m mRNA remained undetectable in MCF-7/Adr cells following cycloheximide treatment. However, in MCF-7 cells, increased beta 2m mRNA was observed after 12 h, and a similar level of increased mRNA expression was observed after 36 h of cycloheximide treatment in MCF-7/Adr-5 cells; these results suggest that one of the mechanisms controlling beta 2m mRNA expression might be a negative regulatory protein in MCF-7/Adr-5 cells. Analysis of the beta 2m status of other drug-resistant MCF-7 sublines revealed that deregulation of beta 2m is not limited to DOX resistance, but can also be detected in cells selected for resistance to mAMSA and DOX-verapamil. In addition, our data show that reduced beta 2m expression correlates with the decreased levels of estrogen receptor (ER) expression in the DOX-resistant MCF-7/Adr and T-47D/Adr-4 human breast cell lines. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the partial inhibition of beta 2m by antisense RNA results in 2-3-fold decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to DOX and mAMSA. Moreover, the addition of exogenous beta 2m protein near its physiological human serum concentration can modulate the DOX sensitivity of the MCF-7 antisense beta 2m and control transfectants. Therefore, these results indicate that lost or decreased beta 2m expression is involved in the development of the drug-resistant phenotype and correlates with the loss of ER in human breast cancer cell lines.

TI  - [Antibiotic efflux, a mechanism of multiple resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa]  
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays three active efflux systems, made of three components: an inner membrane protein acting as a proton motive pump, a periplasmic linking protein and an outer membrane protein acting as an efflux porin. All three proteins are encoded by genes organised as an operon, with a regulator gene in the vicinity. Efflux systems produce phenotypes of multidrug resistance. The constitutively produced system MexAB-OprM generates intrinsic resistance to most beta-lactams, quinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole; in addition, genetic derepression causes acquired resistance to the same drugs. The non constitutive MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN can be expressed by mutation, producing then slightly different multidrug resistant phenotypes. Efflux systems are responsible for low level resistance, and seem to promote selection of mutations responsible for higher level resistance. The multidrug resistance associated to active efflux systems should be taken into account in our antibiotic policies, both at the individual and at the institutional level.

AB  - Three human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects with progressive cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis despite prolonged antiviral therapy had buffy coat CMV isolates that were resistant to both ganciclovir and foscarnet. Genetic analysis of the resistant isolates showed that each contained a well-known ganciclovir resistance mutation in the viral UL97 phosphotransferase sequence, as well as a mutation (Ala to Val at codon 809, V809) in conserved region III of the DNA polymerase (Pol) sequence. A segment of the Pol sequence from one of the clinical isolates was transferred to CMV laboratory strain AD169 by homologous recombination. The recombinant virus containing V809 showed 6.3-fold increased foscarnet resistance and 2.6-fold increased ganciclovir resistance. Occurrence of the V809 mutation in 3 unrelated cases suggests that it is a clinically significant viral genetic marker for foscarnet resistance and decreased susceptibility to ganciclovir.

TI  - A review of the actions and control of intracellular pH in vascular smooth muscle.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review is an account of the physiological issues involved in the effects of pH on vascular smooth muscle tone. The following criteria were considered when reviewing the literature: (i) the type of smooth muscle, i.e. either tonic or phasic, (ii) the source of the smooth muscle i.e. pulmonary, systemic, large artery, resistance artery, vein or cell line, (iii) the effects of changing intracellular or extracellular pH alone, (iv) the acute or chronic effects of altered pH (v) the influence of extracellular pH on intracellular pH and (vi) the influence of altered intracellular pH on basal or agonist induced tone. Studies of the effects of pH on the individual intracellular components of vascular tone, specifically sarcoplasmic reticulum and contractile proteins function are considered. Finally, the pH sensitivity of molecular components that contribute to smooth muscle cell tone are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be distinct differences in the response of large arteries and resistance arteries to altered intracellular pH which may be based on the different properties of the smooth muscle within the wall of each blood vessel. Similarly, systemic and pulmonary vessels may respond differently, but no systematic study exists to allow a more definitive conclusion. Factors controlling intracellular pH such as intracellular buffering power and sarcolemmal pH regulating mechanisms may differ across the vascular bed and may contribute to some of the differences observed in response to altered extracellular pH. Finally, few studies have examined the pH sensitivity the intracellular processes involved in basal tone and pharmaco-mechanical coupling in vascular smooth muscle. More information concerning these latter aspects of smooth muscle function is required to progress the understanding of the modulator action on pH on vascular tone.

TI  - Allelic exchange at the endogenous genomic locus in Plasmodium falciparum proves the role of dihydropteroate synthase in sulfadoxine-resistant malaria.  
AB  - We have exploited the recently developed ability to trans- fect the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to investigate the role of polymorphisms in the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), identified in sulfadoxine-resistant field isolates. By using a truncated form of the dhps gene, specific mutations were introduced into the endogenous gene by allelic replacement such that they were under the control of the endogenous promoter. Using this approach a series of mutant dhps alleles that mirror P.falciparum variants found in field isolates were found to confer different levels of sulfadoxine resistance. This analysis shows that alteration of Ala437 to Gly (A437G) confers on the parasite a 5-fold increase in sulfadoxine resistance and addition of further mutations increases the level of resistance to 24-fold above that seen for the transfectant expressing the wild-type dhps allele. This indicates that resistance to high levels of sulfadoxine in P.falciparum has arisen by an accumulation of mutations and that Gly437 is a key residue, consistent with its occurrence in most dhps alleles from resistant isolates. These studies provide proof that the mechanism of resistance to sulfadoxine in P.falciparum involves mutations in the dhps gene and determines the relative contribution of these mutations to this phenotype.

TI  - [The intracerebral route of kynurenine administration is one of the reasons for the resistance of kynurenine-induced seizures to diazepam]  
AB  - It has been shown many times that in experiments on mice systemic administration of anticonvulsive doses of diazepam caused a 15-20-fold higher effect against the endogenous convulsant kynurenine (injection into the brain ventricles) than against corasol (systemic injection). In the present work diazepam (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) prevented convulsions induced in nonbred and C57B1/6 mice by equally effective doses of corasol injected subcutaneously (80 mg/kg) better than in injection into the brain ventricles (500 micrograms). In injection of the three drugs into the ventricles diazepam (0.5-10 micrograms) relieved to a similar degree convulsions induced by equally effective doses of corasol (500 micrograms) and kynurenine (50 micrograms). It follows from this that the unique resistance the kynurenine convulsions to diazepam is due to the fact that only kynurenine is injected into the brain ventricles whereas all the other convulsants compared with it are administered systemically. It is suggested that besides the route of administration, the more significant dependence of kynurenine convulsions on GAMA(B) receptors and the activity of the brain dopaminergic system is responsible for the difference in the diazepam sensitivity of kynurenine and corasol convulsions.

TI  - Maturational change of KCl-induced Ca2+ increase in the rat brain synaptosomes.  
AB  - To investigate maturational change in the susceptibility of voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels (VDCC) in the brain to excessive depolarization, which is likely to occur during hypoxia or ischemia, we studied depolarization-induced increases in Ca2+ concentration in cortical synaptosomes ([Ca2+]i) obtained from young (8, 15, 22, 36, and 43-day-old) and adult rats using fura 2-AM as a Ca2+ indicator. The effects of Ca2+ antagonists on the increase were also studied. The maximal increase in [Ca2+]i caused by 50 mM KCl-induced depolarization was significantly lower in 8-day-old rats (73.3 nM) compared with that in adult rats (133.6 nM). On the other hand, the time necessary for [Ca2+]i to decrease to 50% of its maximal level (tau) was significantly shorter in immature rats compared with that in adult rats and was particularly short in 8- and 15-day-old rats (0.28 and 0.40 min vs. 3.85 for adult rats). The maximal increase in [Ca2+]i in 22-day-old rats and tau in adult rats were markedly reduced by verapamil, omega-agatoxin IVA, and omega-conotoxin GVIA (antagonists of L-, P-, and N-type Ca2+ channels, respectively) to similar extents, while a mixture of the three antagonists markedly decreased both maximal increase and tau in 8- and 22-day-old and adult rats. These results indicate that depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through VDCCs in immature rat brain is less pronounced than that in adult rats, and suggest that the susceptibility of all of L-, N-, and P-type Ca2+ channels is increased during maturation in the first few weeks after birth. This lower susceptibility to depolarization might be involved in the resistance to hypoxia in immature animals.

TI  - The human insulin analogue insulin lispro.  
AB  - Insulin lispro is a newly developed analogue of human insulin where the positions of the amino acids lysine and proline have been switched at the end of the B chain of the insulin molecule. Insulin lispro with lysine at position B28 and proline at position B29 has a weaker tendency for self-association than human insulin. This leads to three major differences in the pharmacokinetics: the action begins faster, has a higher peak and the duration is shorter than with human insulin. Thus, insulin lispro has a more precise action profile for the mealtime than human regular insulin. Insulin lispro is recommended to be injected within 15 min before the meal in contrast to 30-40 min for human insulin. In clinical trials with insulin lispro, the postprandial rise of blood glucose is smaller, the rate of hypoglycaemia is lower particularly at night-time, the need for snacks is smaller and the patient preference is better than with human insulin. The long-term control as reflected by an improvement in the HbA1c level is better with insulin lispro than with human regular insulin, provided that an appropriate basal insulin regimen is used to take into account the shorter duration of action. A few patients have been described who have a severe resistance to human insulin but who have been successfully treated with insulin lispro. Insulin lispro was designed to be used as a mealtime insulin, and it is a step forward in the treatment of diabetic patients using a basal-bolus insulin regimen.

TI  - D-subgenome bias of Xcm resistance genes in tetraploid Gossypium (cotton) suggests that polyploid formation has created novel avenues for evolution.  
AB  - A detailed RFLP map was used to determine the chromosomal locations and subgenomic distributions of cotton (Gossypium) genes/QTLs that confer resistance to the bacterial blight pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum (Xcm). Genetic mapping generally corroborated classic predictions regarding the number and dosage effects of genes conferring Xcm resistance. One recessive allele (b6) was a noteworthy exception to the genetic dominance of most plant resistance alleles. This recessive allele appeared to uncover additional QTLs from both resistant and ostensibly susceptible genotypes, some of which corresponded in location to resistance (R)-genes effective against other Xcm races. One putatively "defeated" resistance allele (B3) reduced severity of Xcm damage by "virulent" races.  Among the six resistance genes derived from tetraploid cottons, five (83%) mapped to D-subgenome chromosomes-if each subgenome were equally likely to evolve new R-gene alleles, this level of bias would occur in only about 1.6% of cases. Possible explanations of this bias include biogeographic factors, differences in evolutionary rates between subgenomes, gene conversion or other intergenomic exchanges that escaped detection by genetic mapping, or other factors. A significant D-subgenome bias of Xcm resistance genes may suggest that polyploid formation has offered novel avenues for phenotypic response to selection.

Cyromazine reduced egg production, hatch, and subsequent larval survival in susceptible genotypes by acting at the embryonic stage of development.  Resistance negated these effects dominantly for egg production and egg hatch and in a partially dominant manner for egg-to-adult survivorship.

TI  - Flow-induced responses in skeletal muscle venules: modulation by nitric oxide and prostaglandins.  
AB  - Skeletal muscle arterioles dilate in response to increases in flow velocity/wall shear stress (WSS). The effect of flow/WSS on the diameter of skeletal muscle venules and the possible endothelial mediation of the response, however, have not yet been characterized. Thus changes in diameter of pressurized (10 mmHg) and norepinephrine-preconstricted venules (179 +/- 8 micron in diameter) to increases in perfusate flow before and after endothelium removal or application of inhibitors of NO and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 10(4) M) and indomethacin (Indo, 2.8 x 10(5) M), respectively, were measured. Increases in perfusate flow [elicited by increases in the pressure difference (Pdiff) between proximal and distal cannulas] evoked with a delay of 17 +/- 2 s dilations, up to 36 +/- 9 micron at the highest flow, a response that was completely eliminated by removal/disruption of the venular endothelium. Calculation of WSS indicated that in endothelium-intact venules, the midpoint of the shear stress-diameter curve was at approximately 8 dyn/cm2, whereas in endothelium-denuded vessels, shear stress increased in a linear fashion with increases in flow, up to 40 dyn/cm2. L-NNA significantly reduced flow-induced dilations (from 38 +/- 11 to 17 +/- 9 micron at 14 mmHg Pdiff), whereas in the additional presence of Indo, flow elicited constriction of venules decreasing basal diameter (by 21 +/- 8 micron at Pdiff 12 mmHg). Thus in skeletal muscle venules an increase in shear stress due to increases in perfusate flow stimulates the release of endothelium-derived NO and PGs eliciting dilation, which in turn, regulates WSS, albeit at a lower value than what is observed in arterioles. In the absence of NO and PGs, flow-induced constriction is revealed, the cause of which remains obscure. From these data, we propose that shear stress-related responses of venules are involved in the regulation of venular resistance, especially during high flow conditions, such as reactive and exercise hyperemia.

TI  - Resistance to fracture of three all-ceramic systems.  
AB  - All-ceramic restorations have become an attractive alternative to porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns, but their strength is still an important issue. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro fracture resistance of three all-ceramic systems: IPS Empress, In-Ceram, and Procera AllCeram. Thirty dies were replicated from a master die using high filler resin with a modulus of elasticity similar to dentin. Ten cores each of In-Ceram and Procera were fabricated to a thickness of 0.5 mm. The remaining porcelain was applied using a sculpting device to produce a crown with a final thickness of 1.0 mm axially and 2.5 mm occlusally. Ten IPS Empress crowns were mixed to the same dimensions and were pressed by the manufacturer. The internal surfaces of all the crowns were etched and silanated prior to cementation with a resin cement (Panavia 21). The cemented samples were loaded in an Instron machine until fracture. The mean fracture loads were: IPS Empress, 222.45 (+/- 49) kg; In-Ceram, 218.8 (+/- 36) kg; Procera AllCeram, 194.20 (+/- 37) kg. Tukey's test showed no statistically significant differences among the three all-ceramic systems at p < .05.

TI  - The root knot nematode resistance gene Mi from tomato is a member of the leucine zipper, nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat family of plant genes.  
AB  - The Mi locus of tomato confers resistance to root knot nematodes. Tomato DNA spanning the locus was isolated as bacterial artificial chromosome clones, and 52 kb of contiguous DNA was sequenced. Three open reading frames were identified with similarity to cloned plant disease resistance genes. Two of them, Mi-1.1 and Mi-1.2, appear to be intact genes; the third is a pseudogene. A 4-kb mRNA hybridizing with these genes is present in tomato roots. Complementation studies using cloned copies of Mi-1.1 and Mi-1.2 indicated that Mi-1.2, but not Mi-1.1, is sufficient to confer resistance to a susceptible tomato line with the progeny of transformants segregating for resistance. The cloned gene most similar to Mi-1.2 is Prf, a tomato gene required for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Prf and Mi-1.2 share several structural motifs, including a nucleotide binding site and a leucine-rich repeat region, that are characteristic of a family of plant proteins, including several that are required for resistance against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and now, nematodes.

TI  - Origin and prevention of airport malaria in France.  
AB  - Since 1969, 63 cases of airport malaria have been reported in Western Europe, 24 of which occurred in France. Most were due to Plasmodium falciparum. In 1994, 7 cases occurred in and around Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG), showing 4 types of contamination: among employees working on airstrips or opening containers, among residents living near the airport, among people living at some distance from the airport after a secondary transport of vectors, and by vectors transported in luggage. In-flight or stop-over infection is not considered as airport malaria. The infective anophelines originated from airports where malaria transmission occurs, mostly in subsaharan Africa. A tentative list is given taking into account aerial traffic with France. Surveys in the airports of Dakar (Senegal), Cotonou (Benin), Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) and Yaounde (Cameroun) found potential vectors in all of these from July to September. After 1994, the Controle Sanitaire aux Frontieres (CSF) in charge at CDG concentrated its efforts on the flights at risk, as well as information and sensitization of airline companies, which resulted in 73% and 87% of the flights at risk being properly disinsected in 1995 and 1996.  Despite pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s. in West Africa, the efficacy of aircraft spraying with permethrin aerosols is still acceptable. However, surveillance of resistance should be improved and search for nonpyrethroid insecticides suitable for aircraft strongly encouraged.

TI  - Decreased resistance to primary intravenous Cryptococcus neoformans infection in aged mice despite adequate resistance to intravenous rechallenge.  
AB  - It is often stated that impaired immune functions in the aged underlie their greater susceptibility to infections. Indeed, in many experimental settings, T-cell responses in aged mice have been shown to be deficient compared with those from young adults. Nonetheless, there are very few examples where a greater susceptibility to infection in aged mice has been demonstrated to result from impaired T-cell function. The clinical importance of understanding the basis for increased susceptibility to infection that accompanies advanced age dictates a need for experimental models with which to study the effect that aging has on immunological resistance to infection. This study was undertaken to investigate whether aged mice were less resistant than young adult control mice to infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. After a primary intravenous challenge with yeast, aged mice died sooner and developed higher organ burdens of yeast than did young adults. Deficient in vitro responses were observed in T cells from aged mice; however, greater susceptibility to intravenous infection appeared not to result from less effective T-cell-dependent resistance in vivo. In fact, T-cell-replete aged mice were more susceptible to intravenous cryptococcal infection than were T-cell-depleted young adults. Furthermore, aged mice were as resistant to primary pulmonary challenge with Cryptococcus as were young adults. Similarly, vaccinated aged mice were as resistant to rechallenge as were young adult counterparts. Therefore, despite demonstrably deficient in vitro responses of T cells from aged mice, their T-cell-dependent resistance to C. neoformans is as effective as that of young adults.

TI  - Relation between transamination of branched-chain amino acids and urea synthesis: evidence from human pregnancy.  
AB  - Protein and nitrogen (N) accretion by the mother is a major adaptive response to pregnancy in humans and animals to meet the demands of the growing conceptus. Quantitative changes in whole body N metabolism were examined during normal pregnancy by measuring the rates of leucine N (QN) and carbon (QC) kinetics with the use of [1-13C,15N]leucine. Rate of synthesis of urea was measured by [15N2]urea tracer. Pregnancy-related change in total body water was quantified by H2[18O] dilution, and respiratory calorimetry was performed to quantify substrate oxidation. A significant decrease in the rate of urea synthesis was evident in the 1st trimester (nonpregnant 4.69 +/- 1.14 vs. pregnant 3.44 +/- 1.11 micromol . kg-1 . min-1; means +/- SD, P < 0.05). The lower rate of urea synthesis was sustained through the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. QN was also lower in the 1st trimester during fasting; however, it reached a significant level only in the 3rd trimester (nonpregnant 166 +/- 35 vs. 3rd trimester 135 +/- 16 micromol . kg-1 . h-1; P < 0.05). There was no significant change in QC during pregnancy. A significant decrease in the rate of transamination of leucine was evident in the 3rd trimester both during fasting and in response to nutrient administration (P < 0.05). The rate of deamination of leucine was correlated with the rate of urea synthesis during fasting (r = 0.59, P = 0.001) and during feeding (r = 0.407, P = 0. 01). These data show that pregnancy-related adaptations in maternal N metabolism are evident early in gestation before any significant increase in fetal N accretion. It is speculated that the lower transamination of branched-chain amino acids may be due to decreased availability of N acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate as a consequence of resistance to insulin action evident in pregnancy.

TI  - Characterization of a staphylococcal plasmid related to pUB110 and carrying two novel genes, vatC and vgbB, encoding resistance to streptogramins A and B and similar antibiotics.  
AB  - We isolated and sequenced a plasmid, named pIP1714 (4,978 bp), which specifies resistance to streptogramins A and B and the mixture of these compounds. pIP1714 was isolated from a Staphylococcus cohnii subsp. cohnii strain found in the environment of a hospital where pristinamycin was extensively used. Resistance to both compounds and related antibiotics is encoded by two novel, probably cotranscribed genes, (i) vatC, encoding a 212-amino-acid (aa) acetyltransferase that inactivates streptogramin A and that exhibits 58.2 to 69.8% aa identity with the Vat, VatB, and SatA proteins, and (ii) vgbB, encoding a 295-aa lactonase that inactivates streptogramin B and that shows 67% aa identity with the Vgb lactonase. pIP1714 includes a 2,985-bp fragment also found in two rolling-circle replication and mobilizable plasmids, pUB110 and pBC16, from gram-positive bacteria. In all three plasmids, the common fragment was delimited by two direct repeats of four nucleotides (GGGC) and included (i) putative genes closely related to repB, which encodes a replication protein, and to pre(mob), which encodes a protein required for conjugative mobilization and site-specific recombination, and (ii) sequences very similar to the double- and single-strand origins (dso, ssoU) and the recombination site, RSA. The antibiotic resistance genes repB and pre(mob) carried by each of these plasmids were found in the same transcriptional orientation.

Leadership is defined as the roles played by key individuals within a school in facilitating significant curricular change; institutional governance is the administrative structure through which the curricular changes were administered. The characteristics of successful leaders as well as problems caused by poorly chosen leaders are described. The author also discusses how leaders handled resistance to change and the role of students in overcoming this resistance at some institutions. The second half of the chapter focuses on governance structures. The author briefly discusses the role of curriculum committees, how student and faculty committees at some schools worked to implement change, and the implementation at each of the eight schools of a centralized education budget. He concludes with a list of characteristics of successful leadership and successful governance in the process of curriculum reform.

TI  - The expression of constitutively active isotypes of protein kinase C to investigate preconditioning.  
AB  - The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in ischemic preconditioning remains controversial because of difficulties with both its measurement and pharmacological manipulation. We investigated preconditioning in isolated neonatal rat cardiocytes by expressing constitutively active isotypes of PKC. Observations at differing durations of simulated ischemia suggested beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity reflected viability within transfected myocytes. Preconditioning with 90 min of ischemia significantly increased beta-gal activity and myocyte survival after 6 h of ischemia; an effect abolished by PKC inhibitors. After co-transfection with plasmids encoding beta-gal and either constitutively active mutants of PKC-delta, PKC-alpha, wild type PKC-delta, or empty vector, cardiocytes were subjected to 6 h of ischemia. Only PKC-delta, rendered constitutively active by a limited deletion within the pseudosubstrate domain, consistently increased resistance to simulated ischemia (beta-gal activity was 85.6 +/- 11.9% versus 53.7 +/- 6.5% (p &lt;/= 0.01) and dead myocytes 46.8 +/- 3.4% versus 68.7 +/- 2.8% (p &lt;/= 0.01)). Since transfection was apparent in only 5-12% of cells, the results suggested a protective bystander effect that was confirmed by co-culture of transfected myocytes with untransfected myocytes. In neonatal cardiocytes expression of active PKC-delta increases resistance to simulated ischemia. This observation may provide further insight into the mechanism and possible avenues for therapeutic exploitation of preconditioning.

AB  - Immunization of rhesus monkeys with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) recombinants expressing the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or fusion (F) glycoproteins of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) was compared with an intranasally-administered live, attenuated HPIV3 vaccine candidate, the cp45 derivative of the JS strain of wildtype HPIV3. The MVA recombinants, when given parenterally (i.m.) or as a parenteral-local (i.m. and i.t.) combination, induced an antibody response comparable to that of cp45 and protected the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the rhesus monkeys against challenge with wildtype HPIV3. When given by the i.n. route alone, the MVA/PIV3 recombinants induced a serum antibody response that was comparable to that of cp45 and induced resistance in the lower respiratory tract. Despite the ability of the intranasally-administered MVA/PIV3 recombinants to stimulate a good serological response and to protect the lower respiratory tract, they unexpectedly failed to induce a significant level of resistance in the upper respiratory tract. The live, attenuated virus vaccine candidate induced almost complete resistance in both the upper and lower tracts. The data thus identify two vaccine candidates that can protect both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of rhesus monkey, parenterally-administered MVA/PIV3 and intranasally-administered cp45. Further studies with these vaccines in non-human primates and humans should identify the relative merits of these immunogens for use in the very young infant.

TI  - [NO-Dependent mechanisms of adaptation to hypoxia]  
AB  - Studies of nitrogen oxide (NO)-dependent mechanisms of organism resistance to hypoxia demonstrate that (1) acute hypoxia induces NO hyperproduction in the brain and does not affect NO production in the liver; (2) adaptation to hypoxia decreases NO production in the liver and brain; and (3) adaptation to hypoxia prevents NO hyperproduction in the brain and enhances NO synthesis in the lever during acute hypoxia. An NO donor--dinytrosyl iron complexes (DCI, 200 micrograms/kg, single intravenous (i.v.) introduction)--decreases animal resistance to acute hypoxia by 30%, while introduction of an NO synthase inhibitor--N- nitro-L-arginine (NNA, 50 micrograms/kg, single intraperitoneal (i.p.) introduction)--and an NO trap--diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC, 200 mg/kg, single i.p. introduction)--increases the resistance 1.3 and 2 times, respectively. Adaptation to hypoxia is realized against a background of accumulation of heat shock proteins HSP70 in the liver and brain. Course treatment with DCI reproduces the antihypoxic effect of adaptation to hypoxia. Course treatment with NNA during adaptation to hypoxia prevents both accumulation of HSP70 and development of the antihypoxic effect. Hence, No and NO-dependent activation of HSP70 synthesis play an important role in adaptation to hypoxia.

TI  - Drug concentration heterogeneity facilitates the evolution of drug resistance.  
AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms use Darwinian processes to circumvent attempts at their control through chemotherapy. In the case of HIV-1 infection, in which drug resistance is a continuing problem, we show that in one-compartment systems, there is a relatively narrow window of drug concentrations that allows evolution of resistant variants. When the system is enlarged to two spatially distinct compartments held at different drug concentrations with transport of virus between them, the range of average drug concentrations that allow evolution of resistance is significantly increased. For high average drug concentrations, resistance is very unlikely to arise without spatial heterogeneity. We argue that a quantitative understanding of the role played by heterogeneity in drug levels and pathogen transport is crucial for attempts to control re-emergent infectious disease.

We studied the clinical usefulness of single oral doses of pimobendan (2.5 mg) in 8 patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic pulmonary emphysema. We measured the short-term effects of pimobendan on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. Pimobendan significantly decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 23.4 +/- 3.4 to 18.5 +/- 2.5 mmHg, and total pulmonary resistance from 383 +/- 111 to 281 +/- 81 dyne.sec.cm-5, while oxygen delivery and cardiac output increased significantly (oxygen delivery: from 81.8 +/- 10.2 to 93.5 +/- 16.2 ml O2/min. cardiac output: from 4.98 +/- 0.76 to 5.77 +/- 1.49 l/min, means +/- SD). Systemic vascular resistance was not significantly reduced. The ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance was reduced, but not significantly. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) did not change significantly. These results indicate that pimobendan may be useful in the treatment of patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension.

TI  - Identification and molecular characterization of an efflux pump involved in Pseudomonas putida S12 solvent tolerance.  
AB  - Bacteria able to grow in aqueous:organic two-phase systems have evolved resistance mechanisms to the toxic effects of solvents. One such mechanism is the active efflux of solvents from the cell, preserving the integrity of the cell interior. Pseudomonas putida S12 is resistant to a wide variety of normally detrimental solvents due to the action of such an efflux pump. The genes for this solvent efflux pump were cloned from P. putida S12 and their nucleotide sequence determined. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the three genes involved show a striking resemblance to proteins known to be involved in proton-dependent multidrug efflux systems. Transfer of the genes for the solvent efflux pump to solvent-sensitive P. putida strains results in the acquisition of solvent resistance. This opens up the possibilities of using the solvent efflux system to construct bacterial strains capable of performing biocatalytic transformations of insoluble substrates in two-phase aqueous:organic medium.

TI  - Fluconazole-resistant Candida species in the oral flora of fluconazole-exposed HIV-positive patients.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of preceding fluconazole treatment on the oral mycologic flora and on the sensitivity of oral Candida albicans isolates to fluconazole. Saline oral rinses were collected from 89 HIV-positive patients, of whom 48 had been exposed to fluconazole and 41 were fluconazole-naive. The rinses were cultured on Sabouraud's and Pagano Levin agars, and yeasts were identified by standard methods. Fluconazole sensitivity of C. albicans isolates was measured by disk diffusion assay. C. albicans was isolated from 69% of patients who had received fluconazole and from 93% of the patients who were fluconazole-naive (p < 0.05). Nine other species of yeasts were also isolated, most commonly C. glabrata. Five patients previously exposed to fluconazole harbored fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, whereas no resistance was detected among the patients who were fluconazole-naive (p < 0.01). Sixteen of the patients who were fluconazole-exposed carried yeasts other than C. albicans, compared with only five patients in the fluconazole-naive group (p < 0.01). All of the fluconazole-resistant strains were isolated from patients with low CD4 counts (less than 100 cells/ml) and after lengthy fluconazole exposures. Nevertheless, patients in Charlotte, N.C., who had a greater mean fluconazole exposure time (10.25 +/- 1.41 months) than patients in Glasgow, UK, (0.65 +/- 0.18 months; p < 0.005), did not develop significantly more in vitro resistance or species diversity. This study indicates that long-term fluconazole treatment can have significant effects on the yeast flora of the mouth, particularly in a patient with a CD4 count of less than 100 cells/ml.

TI  - [Determination of resistance mechanism in Culex quinquefasciatus Say 1823 and its operational implication in the correct use of insecticides for its control]  
AB  - Resistance to organophosphorous insecticides such as malathion, chlorpyrihos, and pyrimiphos-methyl; pyrethroids such as deltametrine and lambda cialotrine; and the propoxur carbamate was determined in 4 strain of Culex quinquefasciatus of the Eastern, Central and Western parts of Cuba. The increase of esterase enzymes was the main mechanism involved in resistance, followed by altered acetylcholinesterase (AChe). Gene frequencies were high for esterases (1), and moderate for acetylcholinesterase (0.52) in the four strains under study, as an average. Bioassays showed resistance to malathion and propoxur. The use of DEF as esterase inhibitor showed that pyrimiphos-methyl was not affected by this mechanism of resistance, and chlorpyriphos was slightly affected. After 5 years of using pyrethroids such as deltametrine and lambda cialotrine, these are still useful agents for the control of C. quinquefasciatus; the alternate use of these and pyrimiphos-methyl or chlorpyriphos could prevent the development of resistance in a short or medium term.
