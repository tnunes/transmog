TI  - Confusional State Evaluation (CSE): an instrument for measuring severity of delirium in the elderly.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium or confusional state is a common mental disorder in the elderly. To follow changes in symptoms over time and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of delirium, a reliable and valid instrument for measuring degrees of delirium is essential. METHOD: An observer's rating scale with 22 items, the Confusional State Evaluation (CSE), was developed. Scores on 12 of the items were summarised to a "confusion score". Based on ratings of 71 demented and non-demented elderly patients with delirium, the interrater reliability and validity of the scale was studied. RESULTS: Agreement between two independent raters was fair to excellent (weighted kappa 0.38-0.93). The correlation between the "confusion score" of the scale and the global rating by a psychogeriatrician was good (r = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The CSE seems to be a reliable and valid measuring instrument which can be useful in following the course of confusion in elderly patients.

TI  - Bayesian registration of models using finite element eigenmodes.  
AB  - This paper is concerned with registering three-dimensional wire-frame organ models. This involves finding correspondences between points on the models of two different examples of the same organ. Such registration is widely used in the processing of medical data; for example in segmentation, or to superimpose functional information on a more detailed structural map. The algorithm described in this paper is based on matching the modes of deformation of organ shapes. Modes with lower spatial frequency characterise large scale organ features whereas small scale variations determine the high frequency modes. First, the organ sizes are normalised using a generalised version of the centroid size metric. The axes of the fundamental frequency modes are then aligned to provide initial rigid-body registration. The registration is refined by matching increasingly high frequency modes using the 'Highest confidence first' algorithm. The matches are evaluated using a Bayesian combination of local prior and likelihood functions. The prior is derived from the Gompertz metric of biological growth and ensures that physically impossible matches are not accepted. The likelihood function is a measure of the similarity between local modal deformation components. The registration algorithm has been applied by the authors in the analysis of three dimensional ultrasound data. Results are presented showing the registration of two liver models derived from 3D ultrasound.

TI  - Clustering of long-term complications in families with diabetes in the diabetes control and complications trial. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group.  
AB  - We investigated familial clustering of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy in the families of 372 subjects from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). These subjects had 467 first-degree relatives with IDDM or NIDDM. Family sizes ranged from two to six. A complete data set was obtained from 241 relatives of 217 DCCT subjects. Among the DCCT subjects, 53% were in the intensive treatment group and 47% were in the conventional group; 44% were from the primary prevention cohort (no retinopathy or microalbuminuria at the DCCT baseline) and 56% were from the secondary intervention cohort (mild-to-moderate nonproliferative retinopathy and <200 mg/24 h albumin excretion rate [AER] at baseline). Retinopathy and nephropathy were assessed with seven-field stereo fundus photography and timed urinary AER measurements. Retinopathy was assessed using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. ETDRS scores and AERs were adjusted for the DCCT treatment group and for significant covariates from among sex, age, diabetes duration, HbA1c value, and body weight. Familial associations were assessed by comparing the prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy in diabetic relatives of the respective positive versus negative DCCT subjects. To determine family clustering of the severity of retinopathy or nephropathy, the intraclass (familial) correlation was computed from the log-adjusted retinopathy and nephropathy scores of DCCT subjects and their relatives for all family members and sib-sib relationships. For parent-offspring, mother-child, and father-child relationships, the pairwise estimate of the correlations was computed. A correlation of 0.2 was considered to be biologically meaningful a priori. Among families of patients in the intensive and conventional groups combined, there was an increased risk of severe retinopathy (an ETDRS score > or =47, clinically significant macular edema, or laser treatment in either eye) among relatives of retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative DCCT subjects in the secondary intervention cohort (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI 1.2-7.8; P < 0.05). There was no increase in the risk of retinopathy of any severity (microaneurysms or worse) in the relatives of retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative DCCT subjects of the primary prevention cohort. There was an increased risk of nephropathy (AER >40 mg/24 h) in relatives of nephropathy-positive versus nephropathy-negative DCCT subjects of the secondary intervention cohort (OR, 5.4; 95% CI 2.2-13.7; P < 0.001). The risk of severe retinopathy in the relatives of positive versus negative subjects from the conventional treatment group alone (OR, 4.3; 95% CI 1.01-18.6; P < 0.05) was statistically significant and somewhat greater than that among relatives of the subjects in intensive treatment group (OR, 2.4; 95% CI 0.7-8.1), which was not significant. Correlations for the severity of retinopathy were 0.187 (all family members), 0.327 (parent-offspring), 0.249 (father-child), 0.391 (mother-child), and 0.060 (sib-sib), using the combined treatment group families. All these correlations were statistically significant (P < 0.05), except for sib-sib. The results showed similar trends when the families from the conventional and intensive treatment groups were analyzed separately. Correlations for nephropathy in the combined treatment group families were 0.063 (all family members), 0.138 (parent-offspring), 0.170 (father-child), 0.103 (mother-child), and 0.107 (sib-sib). None of these correlations is statistically significant. The lack of significant correlation for the severity of nephropathy may reflect the relatively short duration of diabetes in the offspring of these families and the known high intrasubject variability of AERs. These data provide the first available evidence that the severity of diabetic retinopathy is inf

TI  -  Semi-micro-scale frontal gel chromatography of interacting systems of a protein and small molecules: binding of warfarin, tryptophan, or FMN to albumin, and of o-nitrophenol to catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.  
AB  - Frontal gel chromatography is a convenient and accurate method to obtain the free ligand concentration of a protein-ligand mixture. Because a large amount of sample (more than 6 ml) is required for the method, it has been rarely used for binding experiments. We have developed a system to carry out frontal gel chromatography on a semi-micro scale using short gel filtration columns (4.6 mm x 50-100 mm); frontal chromatograms could be obtained with small amounts of samples (1-2.5 ml) within 20 min. We used this technique to examine the binding of warfarin, L-tryptophan, or FMN to human serum albumin, the binding of warfarin to bovine serum albumin, and the interaction of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase with o-nitrophenol. The data fitted to a binding model in which a protein has one or several independent binding sites. Both human and bovine serum albumin showed the high-affinity bindings of two warfarin molecules. The binding number for L-tryptophan on human serum albumin was confirmed to be one, whereas maximal binding of FMN was 0.6 molecule per albumin molecule. o-Nitrophenol showed high-affinity binding only to holocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase. The absorption spectrum of the bound o-nitrophenol resembled that of anionic o-nitrophenol. These results demonstrated that frontal gel chromatography on a semi-micro scale is useful for the study of binding systems; the method is rapid and would be easy to automate fully.

TI  - Dutch normal-pressure hydrocephalus study: prediction of outcome after shunting by resistance to outflow of cerebrospinal fluid.  
AB  - The authors examined whether measurement of resistance to outflow of cerebrospinal fluid (Rcsf) predicts outcome after shunting for patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). In four centers 101 patients (most of whom had idiopathic NPH) who fulfilled strict entry criteria underwent shunt placement irrespective of their level of Rcsf obtained by lumbar constant flow infusion. Gait disturbance and dementia were quantified by using an NPH scale and the patient's level of disability was assessed by using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). In addition the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination was performed. Patients were assessed prior to and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Primary outcome measures were based on differences between the preoperative and last NPH scale scores and mRS grades. Improvement was defined as a change measuring at least 15% in the NPH scale score and at least one mRS grade. Intention-to-treat analysis of all patients at 1 year yielded improvement for 57% in NPH scale score and 59% in mRS grade. Efficacy analysis, excluding serious events and deaths that were unrelated to NPH, was performed for 95 patients. Improvement rose to 76% in NPH scale score and 69% in mRS grade. Six cut-off levels of Rcsf were related to improvement in NPH scale score using two-by-two tables. Positive predictive values were approximately 80% for an Rcsf of 10, 12, or 15 mm Hg/ml/minute, 92% for an Rcsf of 18 mm Hg/ml/minute, and 100% for an Rcsf of 24 mm Hg/ml/minute. Negative predictive values were low. More important was the highest likelihood ratio of 3.5 for an Rcsf of 18 mm Hg/ml/minute. Extensive comorbidity was a major prognostic factor. Measurement of Rcsf reliably predicts outcome if the limit for shunting is raised to 18 mm Hg/ml/minute. At lower Rcsf values the decision depends mainly on the extent to which clinical and computerized tomography findings are typical of NPH.

TI  - Measuring excessive alcohol use in college drinking contexts: the Drinking Context Scale.  
AB  - Research on youthful drinking has shown that the greatest risks associated with alcohol abuse are related to contextual factors that may potentiate heavy drinking as well as increase risks for adverse consequences. These contextual factors include interacting psychological, interpersonal, and environmental dimensions of alcohol use. However, despite considerable college drinking research to identify these factors, few formal instruments have been produced for measuring excessive drinking in multidimensional contexts. The current study of 197 college students who were cited their first time for breaking university drinking rules focuses on the development and validation of a scale for measuring the likelihood of excessive drinking across an array of psychological, interpersonal and situational contexts resulting in the 23-item Drinking Context Scale (DCS). Three distinct factors emerged defining Convivial drinking, Private Intimate drinking, and drinking as a form of Negative Coping. These three factors explained 61.5% of the variance after principal components analysis and varimax rotation, showed excellent internal reliabilities, and were moderately intercorrelated. MANOVA analysis demonstrated concurrent validity with the Quality Frequency Index (QFI) and a modified version of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Implications for further research with the DCS are suggested.

TI  - Genetic population structure of the Greater Bilby Macrotis lagotis, a marsupial in decline.  
AB  - The Greater Bilby has shown a rapid decline in range during this century and now occupies only a small isolated area in south-western Queensland (QLD) and a larger, but mostly low-density area in the north-western deserts of the Northern Territory (NT) and Western Australia (WA). We have examined variation in the control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and at nine microsatellite loci in order to investigate the extent of current and historical subdivision across the species range, and to provide a preliminary assessment of genetic structuring and mating system on a finer scale within the QLD population. Both mtDNA and microsatellite loci had substantial variation within and among populations, with mtDNA divergence being greater between QLD and NT than between NT and WA. The QLD population had two unique and divergent mtDNA lineages, but there was no evidence for strong phylogeographical structure across the range. The available evidence suggests that the bilby should be considered as a single Evolutionarily Significant Unit consisting of multiple Management Units. Augmentation of the remnant QLD population from the NT does not appear necessary at this stage, at least not on genetic grounds.  Finer-scale analysis of microsatellite variation for two QLD colonies revealed a deficiency of heterozygotes and significantly greater relatedness within than between colonies. However, structuring was observed only for males; relatedness values for females did not depart from those expected under panmixia. Parentage exclusion analysis for one colony allowed the construction of a partial pedigree which indicated strong polygyny, with one male fathering all but one of the eight offspring assigned. The extent to which fine-scale genetic structuring and differences between sexes is due to sex-biased dispersal vs. effects of mating system remain to be determined.

TI  - Translation-, rotation-, scale-, and distortion-invariant object recognition through self-organization.  
AB  - The task of visual object recognition is often complicated by the fact that a single 3-D object can undergo a number of transformations which can substantially alter its projection onto a 2-D surface, such as the retina. Such transformations include translation of the object in the visual field, changes in the size of the object, its orientation in the 2-D plane and the viewing perspective. For a general pattern recognition system to detect and recognize and object after such transformations, it must be able to associate widely differing patterns with the same object label. In this paper, a novel self-organizing model, called the Multiple Elastic Modules (MEM), is presented which attempts to solve this problem by searching a multi-dimensional space, where each axis is defined by one of the transformations (e.g. scale, translation, rotation, etc.). A particular object of a specific size, orientation and spatial location is mapped onto a single point in this space. Of course, distortions and minor variations in an object's image will expand this point to a small localized area in this multi-dimensional space. Such a powerful representation scheme comes at a cost of high computational demand due to the combinatorially large search space. The MEM approach to solving this problem efficiently partitions the solution space to search the most promising areas for the correct match. Simulation results are presented on detecting a stick-figure object under translation, distortion, scale, and rotation transformations in a cluttered background.

TI  - Recognition of rotating images using an automatic feature extraction technique and neural networks.  
AB  - This paper presents a new automatic feature extraction technique and a neural network based classification method for recognition of rotating images. The image processing technique extracts global features of an image and converts a large size image into a one-dimensional small vector. A special advantage of the proposed technique is that the extracted features are the same even if the original image is rotated with rotation angles from 5 to 355 or rotated and a little bit distorted. The proposed technique is based on simple co-ordinate geometry, fuzzy sets and neural networks. The proposed approach is very easy in implementation and it has been developed in C++ on a Sun workstation. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach performs successfully on a variety of small as well as large scale rotated and distorted images.

TI  - Pressure ulcer scale for healing: derivation and validation of the PUSH tool. The PUSH Task Force.  
AB  - Measuring progress toward healing is fundamental to the management of pressure ulcers. A method to assess progress of an individual ulcer over time is lacking. Given the limitations of currently available instruments and the need for a precise and practical method of monitoring healing in clinical practice, the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel initiated the development of a new tool for measuring pressure ulcer healing. The key elements in developing an instrument include simplicity of use in clinical settings, validity for measuring whether ulcers are improving or worsening, and sensitivity to changes in the ulcer between observations. A new tool incorporating surface area, exudate amount, and surface appearance is proposed. Content validity, correlation validity, prospective validity, and sensitivity to change can be met by the proposed Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing instrument.

TI  - Three models of song learning: evidence from behavior.  
AB  - Research on avian song learning has traditionally been based on an instructional model, as exemplified by the sensorimotor model of song development.  Several large-scale, species-wide field studies of learned birdsongs have revealed that variation is narrowly restricted to certain aspects of song structure. Other aspects are sufficiently stereotyped and so widely shared by species' members that they qualify as species-specific universals. The limitations on natural song variation are difficult to reconcile with a fully open, instructive model of song learning. An alternative model based on memorization by selection postulates a system of innate neural templates that facilitate the recognition and rapid memorization of conspecific song patterns. Behavioral evidence compatible with this model includes learning preferences, rapid conspecific song learning, and widespread ocurrence of species-specific song universals that are recognized innately but fail to develop in songs of social isolates. A third model combines instruction, in the memorization phase, with selection during song production. An overproduced repertoire of plastic songs previously memorized by instruction is winnowed by selection imposed during social interactions at the time of adult song crystallization. Selection during production is well established as a factor in the song development of several species, in the form of action-based learning. The possible role of selective processes in song memorization merits further neurobiological investigation.

TI  - The prognostic significance of coma-rating, duration of anoxia and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.  
AB  - Early determination of outcome after successful prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a common problem with great ethical, economic, social, and legal consequences. We prospectively investigated 112 adult patients who had been resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA). The aim of our study was to determine whether coma rating by the mobile intensive care unit (MICU) is a useful tool for outcome prediction. For neurological assessment the Innsbruck Coma Scale (ICS) was used initially and after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or 20-30 min after the start of CPR, before any sedating drugs were given. The duration of anoxia and CPR were determined with the automatically recorded emergency call protocol of the dispatch centre and the protocol of the MICU. For estimation of cerebral outcome at the time of discharge from hospital we used the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). Restoration of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 42 patients (37%), and 15 (13%) were discharged from hospital. The first coma rating performed immediately at the time of arrival on scene had no significant prognostic value for prediction of neurological outcome (P = 0.204) and survival (P = 0.103). The second coma rating (performed after ROSC or 20-30 min after the start of CPR), however, demonstrated a significant correlation with neurological outcome (P = 0.0000) and survival (P = 0.0000), a correlation which was comparable to both duration of anoxia and duration of CPR. In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic information could be obtained with the ICS as early as 20-30 min after the start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

TI  - Noise analysis of three newborn infant isolettes.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the noise of three newborn infant isolettes. STUDY DESIGN: An observational, prospective study evaluated noise in three isolettes (Ohmeda, Air Shields, and Drager). The study measured interior isolette noise production during quiet noise situations and isolette noise attenuation of added low- and high-frequency noise. Noise was measured on the decibel A scale and in the 125 Hz and 1000 Hz bands. RESULTS: During quiet conditions the Ohmeda and Drager isolettes had the least noise production on the basis of decibel A levels (p < 0.001). Low-frequency noise on the decibel A scale was attenuated the most by the Drager isolette (p < 0.001), although the overall difference may be clinically insignificant. The Ohmeda isolette attenuated high-frequency noise by 28.4 dB as measured on the decibel A scale, which was greater than values for the Drager (22.8 dB) and Air Shields (14 dB) isolettes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency noise attenuation by the Ohmeda and Drager isolettes is clinically and statistically greater than high-frequency noise attenuation by the Air Shields isolette.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the influence of amiodarone hydrochloride on time- and frequency-domain parameters of signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The study population consisted of 33 patients (18 female and 15 male), mean age 59.2 +/- 7.7. Amiodarone hydrochloride was orally used in the initial dose 600 mg/day for 10 days, and subsequently 200 mg/days for 6 weeks. Recording of SAECG and ambulatory Holter monitoring were made at baseline and in 10 day and after 6 weeks of therapy. The following time-domain parameters were analyzed: the root mean square voltage of the last 40 and 50 ms of the filtered QRS (RMS40 i RMS50), total time duration of filtered QRS (t-QRS) and duration of low amplitude signals < 40 microV in the terminal part of QRS (LPD). Late potentials (LP) were recognized when at least two from three criteria were fulfilled: 1) RMS40 < 20 microV, 2) t-QRS > 114 ms, 3) LPD > 38 ms. Frequency analysis of SAECG allowed to calculate the following parameters in logarithmic scale: energy spectrum > -60 dB (A) and decibel drop at 40Hz (Dd) and also in linear scale: area ratio 20-50/0-20Hz (Ar) and magnitude ratio (MR1-7). The values of RMS40 and RMS50 did not significantly change during amiodarone therapy. The obtained values of t-QRS were significantly longer after antiarrhythmic therapy, respectively 97.8 +/- 9.1 ms at the baseline, 102.1 +/- 10 ms after 10 days (p < 0.05), and 104.1 +/- 10.4 ms after 6 weeks (p < 0.005). Moreover the values of LPD did not significantly change after amiodarone treatment. At the baseline the presence of LP were observed in 3 (9%), after 10 days were recorded in 8 (24%), and after 6 weeks in 7 (22%) cases. Only in one case the LP were observed during the whole antiarrhythmic therapy. Moreover, amiodarone hydrochloride did not statistically significant change frequency-domain parameters in logarithmic scale and in linear scale.

METHODS: After a drug-free baseline evaluation, patients with rhinitis were randomized to receive either a triamcinolone aerosol spray of 110 microg in each nostril once daily (n = 117) or a fluticasone solution spray of 100 microg in each nostril once daily (n = 116) in a single-blind, parallel-group study. The Rhinitis Index Score (sum of scores of symptoms on a scale from 0 to 3) was evaluated daily, in the morning before drug administration, for 21 days. The efficacy of each treatment was assessed by the mean reduction from baseline in the Rhinitis Index Score and in individual symptom scores. Patients' acceptance of the study drugs was also monitored by a daily questionnaire. RESULTS: Reductions of the Rhinitis Index Score (mean +/- SEM) were 4.20 +/- 0.21 and 4.60 +/- 0.21 for triamcinolone and fluticasone, respectively (p = 0.23). There were no statistically significant differences between the drugs in the reduction of any of the individual symptoms. Patients expressed statistically significant differences between the drugs regarding acceptance; different properties of the aerosol and the solution were appreciated differently. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that triamcinolone acetonide aerosol and fluticasone propionate solution sprays are both clinically equally effective, safe, and well tolerated for the treatment of spring pollen allergic rhinitis.

TI  - High affinity neurotensin receptor mRNA distribution in rat brain and peripheral tissues. Analysis by quantitative RT-PCR.  
AB  - Neurotensin (NT) is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues, and its actions are mediated by a specific family of G protein-coupled receptors. In this study, the authors have measured the levels of gene expression of the high-affinity neurotensin receptor (NTR) with quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the rat brain, the highest quantities of NTR mRNA were found in the ventral mesencephalon and in the hypothalamus. Surprisingly, almost identical quantities were detected in both structures, despite results from in situ hybridization studies revealing a low expression of NTR mRNA in the hypothalamus. The RT-PCR data suggest that large scale NTR mRNA synthesis is occurring in restrictive hypothalamic nuclei. Intermediate levels of expression were detected in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, and scant levels in the cerebellum. In peripheral tissues, the highest levels of NTR mRNA were detected in the colon, followed by the liver, and then duodenum and pancreas. In this study, the sensitivity and the accuracy of the quantitative RT-PCR method provided the means to estimate the relative distribution of NTR mRNA between brain structures and peripheral tissues. Therefore, this study promotes a better understanding of the localization of NTR synthesis in relationship with the various physiological effects of NT.

TI  - Factors associated with aggressive and delinquent behaviors among patients attending an adolescent medicine clinic.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among delinquency/aggressiveness and alcohol or drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and other scales from the Problem-Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT). METHOD: A total of 173 15- to 18-year-olds attending adolescent medicine clinic completed a 183-item questionnaire. The questionnaire contained the POSIT, the CAGE questions, a 22-item alcohol and drug screen (AOD), and a human immunodeficiency virus and sexual risk behavior screen. The dependent variable was the Aggressive Behavior/Delinquency (ABD) scale from the POSIT. RESULTS: There were no gender or racial differences in the ABD scale (p > 0.05). The ABD scale was significantly (p < or = 0.001) associated with the POSIT AOD scale (r = 0.46), the 22-item AOD drug screen (r = 0.57), the CAGE questions (r = 0.39), the sexual risk behavior scale (r = 0.39), and the POSIT physical health (r = 0.34), mental health (r = 0.51), family relations status (r = 0.37), peer relations (r = 0.57), educational status (r = 0.44), social skills (r = 0.31), and leisure/recreation (r = 0.16) scales. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the AOD screen and problems in the area of peer relations, family relations, and mental health accounted for 47.7% of the variation in the ABD scale (p < or = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that adolescents who engage in more aggressive and delinquent behaviors are more likely to use alcohol and other drugs, engage in sexual risk behaviors, report problems with peer and family relationships, and report more mental health symptoms.

AB  - Early identification of potentially harmful eating patterns is critical in the effective remediation of such behaviors. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the degree to which various factors including gender, family history, and athletic status predict disordered eating behavior; social physique anxiety and percent body fat were added as potential predictor variables. The eating behaviors of student-athletes and nonathlete students were also compared. One hundred eighty undergraduate students (males = 49, females = 131) provided demographic information and completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Social Physique Anxiety Scale (SPAS). Stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that social physique anxiety, gender, and body fat (%Fat) combined to predict 34% of disordered eating behaviors: EAT = 0.921 SPA - 1.05 %Fat + 10.95 Gender (1 = M, 2 = F) - 17.82 (R2 = .34, SE = 4.68). A one-way ANOVA comparing the eating behaviors of athletes and nonathletes revealed no significant difference between these groups.

AB  - Of 60 patients with atopic dermatitis (30 males and 30 females, 15-30 years old) 30 were treated with gamma-linolenic acid of (C18:3 n-6) at a dosage of 274 mg twice a day; the other 30 patients were given placebo. The patients were treated for 12 weeks, during which their symptoms were assessed on a linear scale both by a dermatologist and by themselves every 4 weeks. The patients who received gamma-linolenic acid, showed gradual improvements in pruritus, erythema, vesiculation and oozing, which were statistically significant compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Only one patient had presented with scaling at the beginning of the study and this symptom appeared to be less influenced by the effects of gamma-linolenic acid. The assessments of symptoms made by the dermatologist were generally consistent with those made by the patients themselves. gamma-linolenic acid was found to be effective and without side-effects for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

TI  - Development of a modified Winchester disability scale--the elderly at risk rating scale.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To show that the elderly at risk rating scale (EARRS) satisfies the requirements of an assessment tool for routine health checks in people over 75 and would also be suitable as a method of collecting epidemiological data on the needs of the elderly in a locality. DESIGN: Development and validation of a questionnaire based on a modification of the Winchester rating scale, by a series of prospective, comparative studies before the use of the instrument in a community survey. SETTING: Elderly care day hospital and the community. SUBJECTS: Elderly patients referred to an elderly care day hospital; population survey of subjects over 75 living at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reliability of responses using the kappa statistic; comparison of the scale with the Barthel index of daily living. RESULTS: EARRS has satisfactory validity and reliability when repeated by the same observer or a different observer, with a mean weighted kappa score above 0.80 in both instances. As a measure of disability in the community, it is better than the Barthel score in that it avoids the ceiling effect. The score is correlated with age, social situation, and receipt of support services, and individual questions scale appropriately to adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION: The EARRS satisfies the requirements of an assessment tool for health checks in the elderly, It is suitable for both population surveys and routine practice in primary care, has proved popular with practice nurses, and is easy to complete.

TI  - Validating the concept of abuse: women's perceptions of defining behaviors and the effects of emotional abuse on health indicators [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate the construct of abuse in 2 ways: first, to examine female patients' perceptions of abusive behaviors that are typically used in standardized abuse scales; and second, to determine health status symptom and medical utilization differences between women who report emotional abuse and women who are not abused. DESIGN: Cross-sectional interviews and medical record reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Modified directions to the Conflict Tactics Scale were used to identify women's perceptions of abusive behaviors. Personal history of abuse was determined by self-report. Health status was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey-36 and medical services utilization was determined from medical records. The Wahler Physical Symptom Inventory was used to measure symptom experience. SETTING: Patients were interviewed in either a rural primary care practice or an urban medical university practice. PATIENTS: Four hundred seven women older than 18 years were interviewed. Half were from an urban and half from a rural setting. Sixty-four percent of the sample was black. RESULTS: Women saw more behaviors as abusive than are typically identified by the Conflict Tactics Scale and abused women identified more abusive behaviors than nonabused women. Significant health status differences were found between women who reported emotional abuse with no concurrent physical or sexual abuse and nonabused women on 7 of the 8 dimensions of the Short-Form Health Survey health status scales and on 25% of measured symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reflect the idea that women consider many behaviors to be abusive and that abused women perceive more behaviors as abusive than do nonabused women. Given that significant health status differences are shown between emotionally abused and nonabused women, emotional abuse can be viewed as a critical variable in patient health behavior.

TI  - Two-dimensional gray-scale clustering for texture analysis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a new quantitative method for the visual discrimination of image texture. METHODS: Two kinds of image phantoms were prepared, one for evaluating the effects of change in size and gray values of individual pixels (primitives) on perceived coarseness and the other for evaluating changes in groups of pixels (clusters) on perceived heterogeneity. The phantom images were displayed on a CRT and presented to 11 observers who assessed heterogeneity and coarseness on a 10-point scale between -5 and +5. On the basis of the observers' results, a new texture analysis method termed two-dimensional gray-scale clustering analysis was developed and applied to measure quantitatively the texture of the phantoms. The results obtained were then compared with those of the visual evaluation. RESULTS: The size of the primitives and the clusters greatly affected the visual evaluation of heterogeneity and coarseness. Changes in the gray value had only a slight effect. The intra-observer variation for heterogeneity was significantly larger than that for coarseness. Two-dimensional gray-scale clustering analysis could differentiate heterogeneity from coarseness. A high correlation was obtained between the visual evaluation and the quantitative data. CONCLUSION: Quantitative two-dimensional gray-scale clustering analysis appears to be a useful means of texture analysis.

TI  - A comparison a amitriptyline and maprotiline in the treatment of painful polyneuropathy in diabetics and nondiabetics.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare amitriptyline and maprotiline in the treatment of painful polyneuropathy in diabetics and nondiabetics. DESIGN: A double-blind, crossover trial of treatment with amitriptyline, maprotiline, and placebo. Treatment was given in randomized order for periods of 4 weeks. Each period was separated by a 1-week washout. The final dose was 75 mg/day for both amitriptyline and maprotiline. PATIENTS: Thirty-seven patients with diabetic and nondiabetic painful polyneuropathy. OUTCOME MEASURES: The treatment effects were assessed by daily ratings of pain intensity on a 10-step verbal scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worst thinkable pain) and at the end of each treatment period by a global rating of the analgesic effect on a 5-step verbal scale (pain relief scale). For the assessment of depression, the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) was used. RESULTS: Using the global assessment of pain relief at the end of each treatment period, 22 of 33 patients reported reduced pain on amitriptyline treatment compared with 14 of 33 patients on maprotiline treatment and 8 patients on placebo treatment (p < .0001 and p < .05 for amitriptyline and maprotiline, respectively, against placebo). Amitriptyline was slightly better than maprotiline (p < .05) [tested by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. The order in which treatments occurred and the diagnosis of diabetes or nondiabetes did not have any significant effect on the global rating of pain relief. The mean values of the daily ratings of pain intensity showed that pain was more severe in the evenings than in the mornings and that diabetic patients reported worse pain than nondiabetics at baseline. The mean values of pain reduction as assessed with the 10-step verbal scale during the 4th week of treatment showed that amitriptyline and maprotiline were significantly better than placebo in relieving the pain (p < .0001 and p < .01, respectively, post hoc test according to Scheffe). However, there was no significant difference between the pain reduction of amitriptyline compared with maprotiline when assessing pain reduction with the 10-step verbal scale during the 4th treatment week. Nor was there a significant difference between diabetics and nondiabetics with regard to the effect of the drugs. The clinical effect was not significantly correlated to plasma concentration of either amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline or maprotiline in the global or daily assessments. The effect of treatment was not correlated to any particular pain quality nor to the intensity of pain. Depression was noted in three patients who completed the medication trial, but the effect of treatment of pain and depression did not clearly correlate. The adverse side effects of amitriptyline and maprotiline were common, and in 5 patients the medication had to be discontinued because of severe side effects. CONCLUSION: From the present results and the literature, it is concluded that tricyclic antidepressants with a pharmacologic profile similar to amitriptyline are the most effective drugs in the treatment of polyneuropathy pain in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients.

TI  - Ebselen in acute ischemic stroke: a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Ebselen Study Group.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effect of ebselen, a seleno-organic compound with antioxidant activity through a glutathione peroxidase-like action, on the outcome of acute ischemic stroke was evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Patients diagnosed as having acute ischemic stroke who could receive drug treatment within 48 hours of stroke onset were enrolled. Oral administration of ebselen granules suspended in water (150 mg BID) or placebo was started immediately after admission and was continued for 2 weeks. The major end points were the Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 1 month and 3 months after the start of treatment.  The modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores at 1 month and 3 months were also studied as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Three hundred two patients were enrolled in the trial. Intent-to-treat analysis of 300 patients (151 given ebselen and 149 given placebo) revealed that ebselen treatment achieved a significantly better outcome than placebo at 1 month (P = .023, Wilcoxon rank sum test) but not at 3 months (P = .056, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The improvement was significant in patients who started ebselen within 24 hours of stroke onset but not in those who started treatment after 24 hours. There was a corresponding improvement in the modified Mathew Scale and modified Barthel Index scores. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with ebselen improved the outcome of acute ischemic stroke. Ebselen may be a promising neuroprotective agent.

TI  - Adapting the MMPI for use in assessing late adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago.  
AB  - In this study, the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was modified slightly by rewording ten items to fit the vernacular of English employed by young men and women in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The response alternatives were extended to include a "don't understand" answer in addition to "true" and "false." To determine the effectiveness of the MMPI for use in this cultural setting, 202 male and 246 female high school students between the ages of 15 and 20 years were examined. Two clinical groups also were studied: 26 male and 32 female adolescents in psychiatric treatment, as well as 49 male and 14 female juvenile offenders incarcerated for various delinquent acts. The retest stability of the basic MMPI scores was evaluated by readministering the MMPI one week later to samples of normal males and females.  Validity scale data indicated that these late adolescents were responding to the MMPI in ways comparable to normal and clinical groups in the United States. The results of this investigation support the use of the MMPI in the appraisal of emotional problems of adolescents seen in both the mental health and criminal justice systems in Trinidad and Tobago.

TI  - Long-term evaluation of cosmetic appearance of repaired lacerations: validation of telephone assessment. The Stony Brook Wound Registry Study Group [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with lacerations are most concerned about the ultimate cosmetic appearance of their wound. We evaluated methods to assess the long-term cosmetic appearance by telephone survey. METHODS: Patients with lacerations repaired in the ED were contacted by telephone and had direct examination a mean of 112 days after injury. At the time of telephone contact to schedule the ED follow-up visit, patients completed a structured survey instrument. Patients rated their laceration appearance from 0 to 100, and completed a 6-item categorical assessment of cosmetic appearance. During ED follow-up, patients assessed satisfaction with a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), a 0 to 100 numerical scale, and the same 6-item categorical scale. The criterion standard was the validated 6-item categorical scale used by physicians. A score of 6 is optimal; less than 6 is suboptimal. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients participated (mean age 17 years; 55% male subjects). Wounds were mostly located on the head (72%) and upper extremity (24%). Mean wound length was 1.9 cm. On all numerical scales (numerical assessment by telephone, assessment in the ED by VAS, and by 0 to 100 scale in the ED) the patients considered the wound better when the physicians considered the cosmetic appearance to be optimal (87 mm versus 71 mm; 90 mm versus 73 mm; 90 mm versus 73 mm, respectively; P < .01 for all comparisons). The relationship between the 0 to 100 numerical rating scale used in the ED and that used during the telephone survey revealed a strong relationship. The scales had a mean difference of 2.1 mm (95% confidence interval -26 to 30 mm). However, patient categorical scale assessment from the phone interview was not concordant with physician assessment in the ED (kappa = .12). CONCLUSION: The long-term cosmetic appearance of lacerations repaired in the ED can be assessed by asking patients to grade their lacerations from 0 to 100 over the telephone. By contrast, categorical assessment over the telephone is not concordant with physician assessment in the ED. This information may allow easier assessment of injuries and their long-term consequences.

TI  - The role of social anxiety in adolescent peer relations: differences among sociometric status groups and rejected subgroups.  
AB  - Examined the relation between sociometric nominations and social anxiety in adolescence. Participants were 973 students (473 boys and 500 girls) in Grades 6, 7, 8, and 9. Students completed the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents and a sociometric nomination task that included the following behavioral descriptors: liked most, liked least, starts fights the most, best sense of humor, class leader, easiest to push around, and most cooperative. Sociometric nominations were used to classify students into standard sociometric status groups (i.e., popular, average, rejected, neglected, and controversial) as well as into rejected subgroups (aggressive rejected and submissive rejected). Results indicated that students classified as rejected and neglected reported more social anxiety than those classified as average, popular, or controversial. In addition, submissive rejected students reported significantly more social anxiety than did aggressive rejected or average students. Implications of these results for assessment and treatment of adolescents with peer problems are discussed.

TI  - Quality of life among patients with glaucoma in Sweden.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in an unselected sample of patients with glaucoma. METHODS: The HRQOL was studied in a cross-sectional survey in 270 patients from two departments of ophthalmology in different parts of Sweden by using the Swedish Health-Related Quality of Life Survey, a generic HRQOL-instrument adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study. RESULTS: Compared to a random Standard Population Sample, the glaucoma patients showed lower mean score only in the scale of 'Pain' (p < 0.05, effect size 0.17), but higher mean score in 'Sexual functioning' (p < 0.01, effect size 0.35). Significant factors correlated to a lower score on HRQOL-scales were decreased visual acuity and visual field, and comorbidity of cardiovascular and non-vascular systemic diseases. Regarding the topical medications, beta-blockers with or without miotic agents had no negative impact on the HRQOL. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that health-related quality of life in glaucoma patients in general is good, especially when vision is intact, and that topical beta-blockers do not have any negative influence.

TI  - Social phobia: long-term treatment outcome and prediction of response--a moclobemide study.  
AB  - In this open, prospective, structured, naturalistic study of the efficacy of long-term treatment in social phobia 93 consecutive outpatients suffering from severe generalized or circumscribed social phobia (median Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale score 83) and a high degree of concomitant psychiatric disease were administered treatment with moclobemide (712 +/- 75 mg/day at steady state). Fifty-nine patients who responded (Clinical Global Impression for Change: very much/much improved) completed 2 years of treatment. Patients then entered a drug-free period of at least 1 month during which 88% of the patients deteriorated. In a further 2-year treatment period with moclobemide those patients who had deteriorated became responders again. Symptoms recurred in a substantial number of the patients at the end of the study when the dose was reduced and then discontinued. Post-study follow up at 6-24 months after study completion found that 63.2% of patients were almost asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms, 15.8% were off all treatment, 28.1% were back on moclobemide, 10.6% were taking another psychotropic drug and 8.8% were in psychotherapy. All previous non-responders to moclobemide and mostly alcohol abusers (36.9%), had moderate or severe social phobia and were off all treatment (13.3%), on psychotherapy (15.9%) or on another psychotropic drug (8.8%). Discriminant analysis correctly predicted outcome in 93.5% of all patients. Alcohol abuse was by far the strongest predictor of negative outcome. Coexisting generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia were less potent in this regard, whereas high baseline Hamilton anxiety or depression scale scores, circumscribed social phobia, or social phobia unassociated with avoidant personality disorder were predictors of a positive outcome. In conclusion, severe social phobia can be successfully treated in the long-term but many patients may need medication or psychotherapy for many years. Treatment should start as early as possible because complications such as alcohol abuse make treatment difficult.

AB  - Efficacy and safety data of liposomal drugs in a laboratory environment are often not reproduced on an industrial production scale. This is largely due to the fact that the colloid-chemical properties of the liposomes manufactured on a small scale are not reproduced in large scale production. Though the size and the electric charge of liposomes are measured and are adequately specified in relation to the bio-distributions in most developments of liposomes (1), uniformity of lipid components, exposure of bio-chemically important functional groups on the outer surface of liposomes (2), fixed aqueous layer thickness (FALT), number of the lipid bilayers, etc., are dependent upon the scale of production. Nevertheless these properties are not always exactly specified. Uniformity, especially of the functional groups on the membrane surface can be assessed chemically or bio-chemically with fractionated samples, and FALT can be easily determined through electro-chemical means (3). In this review, colloid chemical characterization of liposomes is introduced, FALT as an example, and its importance in a quality control of a liposomal product in an industrial scale production is shown. Methoxy-polyethyleneglycol-diacylglycerol (PEG-DAG) with varying PEG chain length and acyl chains were synthesized, FALT of liposomes coated with PEG-DAG determined and tissue distribution in tumor bearing mice. The higher incorporation ratio of PEG-DAG into liposomal membrane was observed with PEG-DAG with short acyl chains (myristoyl) and a small PEG molecular weight (1000). The easier to incorporate, the easier to be stripped in the serum. The disposition data in the rats well reflected the colloid chemical and in vitro data of the PEG liposomes. Galactosyl-carbonyl-propionyl-polyethyleneglycol-diacylglycerol (Gal-PEG-DAG) with oxyethylene number, n = 10, 20 and 40 were synthesized. The exposure of the galactose residue beyond the fixed aqueous layer of liposomes coated with Gal-PEG-DAG was monitored by a lectin, Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) induced agglutination, the half life in the blood after i.v. injection into rats, organ distribution determined and intrahepatic distribution studied. Only the liposomes containing the Gal-PEG10-DAG aggregated with the lectin, indicating that only with this derivative the galactose group was adequately exposed. The Gal-PEG10-DAG liposomes were cleared from the plasma with a half life of 0.3 h. The plasma elimination could be attributed entirely to increased uptake by the liver. The increased liver uptake was almost entirely attributed to increased uptake by the non-parenchymal cell. Incorporation of PEG-DSPE in to the Gal-PEG10-DAG liposomes caused 1) a three-fold increase in blood circulation time, 2) a small but significant decrease in hepatic uptake after 20 h and 3) a significant shift in intrahepatic distribution in favor of the hepatocytes, comparable to that of the control liposomes. In conclusion, therapeutic efficacy and safety of liposomes can be controlled by their colloid chemical, more exactly, surface chemical properties. By setting up reasonable quality control specification of the properties in laboratory and examining the specifications satisfied in upscaling, the efficacy and safety are reproduced in a large scale product.

TI  - [The role of human recombinant erythropoietin in oncologic surgery]  
AB  - Anemia is common in cancer patients, especially in those with more advanced stages of progressive tumor growth, the frequency varying on type of cancer, stage and chemotherapy or radiation therapy used. The pathophysiology is multifactorial. However the most common anemia is the anemia whose features are similar to those seen in other chronic diseases (anemia of chronic disease--ACD). The pathophysiological mechanisms are: a mild decrease in red blood cells survival, a decreased re-utilization of bone marrow iron stores and an inadequate erythropoietin response to the degree of anemia. When anemia cannot be corrected through the administration of hematinics and anemia is severe enough to significantly restrict physical activity and quality of life, blood transfusion is requested. It has been reported that the percentage of patients requiring transfusion ranges from 20 to 50%. The transfusion of allogeneic blood exposes the recipient to immunological and infectious risks. There is evidence that allogeneic blood transfusions can have immunologic consequences and some argue that these immune changes can adversely affect the prognosis in cancer patient. Although this is still controversial, until it can be shown that blood transfusion is not harmful in the long term to patients with cancer, it seems reasonable to avoid it whenever possible. Recently the availability of recombinant DNA technology permitted large scale production of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). To date several clinical trials employed rHuEPO in anemic cancer patients with various solid tumors both on and off chemotherapy. All these studies have reported a significantly increase in Hct than placebo in more than 50% of the treated patients. The problem of correcting anemia and of blood transfusion is even more important when cancer patients become candidate to major surgery. In such situation, the transfusion of a consistent number of units is generally required to cover the surgical blood loss. The use of homologous blood in surgery can be substantially reduced by the introduction of autologous blood transfusion (ABT) programmes in association with rHuEPO. A number of experimental and clinical studies on the effects of rHuEPO on AB donation and on erythropoiesis in the peri-operative period have demonstrated that it resulted to be effective in stimulating erythropoiesis, with a consequent increase in the volume of red cells produced during the course of treatment and in the number of units predeposited. It was also effective in correcting anemia induced by collection of blood units. The efficacy of rHuEPO in increasing the volume of autologous blood the patient can predeposit before surgery has been demonstrated also in patients with ACD and cancer. No significant adverse effects of rHuEPO administration have been reported in any of the studies published to date. It can be concluded that rHuEPO therapy may be safe and effective in selected surgical patients, in stimulating erythropoiesis, in expanding the circulating RBCs mass, in increasing the volume of AB that can be collected pre-operatively and, consequently, in reducing the exposure to homologous blood. Therapy with rHuEPO may prove to be a useful addition to existing strategies of blood conservation to minimize exposure to HB.

TI  - Nucleus double electrode array: a new approach for ossified cochleae.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ossified cochlea is still a special surgical issue that requires a special surgical procedure. The current cochlear implants only have one electrode lead, which can be placed only partially in the drilled out basal turn. The small number of used active electrodes leads to worse performance as compared with patients with full insertion. METHODS: To overcome this limitation, a special electrode was developed consisting of two arrays. One array with 11 active electrode rings is placed in the drilled out basal turn, the second array with 10 active electrodes in the opened second turn. The number of inserted electrodes can be significantly increased. The surgery is similar to that in nonossified cochleae. After the posterior tympanotomy, the bridge is removed and the incus is located. A cochleostomy is performed at the basal turn and the new-built tissue removed. A second cochleostomy is placed below the cochleariform process. In most cases, the second turn is not obliterated and the second electrode array can be fully inserted. RESULTS: The surgical procedure was in all nine cases uneventful. Intraoperative stapedius reflex could be recorded with elevated thresholds. The wide variety of stimulation modes and sites allows an individual fitting to maximize the performance. All patients show a gap in the pitch scale between the apical and the basal array. The pitch variation is much smaller in the apical array. All patients have some benefit from the additional apical array and an improved performance. CONCLUSION: The nucleus double electrode array is an advanced treatment option for patients with ossified cochleae. The receiver/stimulator is a regular nucleus cochlear implant.

TI  - Reduced disorderliness of growth hormone release in biochemically inactive acromegaly after pituitary surgery [see comments]  
AB  - The episodicity of 24 h GH release was studied in 18 patients with active acromegaly, 12 patients 7-10 days after pituitary surgery, 14 patients long after operation (3-17 years), and 21 healthy gender- and age-matched control subjects, using a recently introduced scale- and model-independent regularity statistic, approximate entropy (ApEn). Blood samples were taken at 10-min intervals for 24 h, and plasma GH concentrations were measured by immunofluorometric assay (detection limit 11.5 ng/l). For this study we selected operated patients who were biochemically in remission, defined by normal circulating IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations, normal glucose-suppressed plasma GH concentration (<0.38 microg/l), and the normalization of the paradoxical rise of GH to TRH or GnRH. In patients with active acromegaly ApEn was 1.23+/-0.04, with no overlap with the control subjects (P = 1.2 x 10[-16]), who had an ApEn of 0.40+/-0.04. ApEn in patients shortly after surgery was 0.71+/-0.09 (P < 0.001 vs controls), and long after surgery 0.56+/-0.05 (P < 0.011 vs controls). ApEn values in treated and untreated patients correlated significantly with the plasma concentration of IGF-I (r=0.531) and IGFBP-3 (r=0.598), and the log-transformed 24h GH secretion rate (r=0.749). Shortly after surgery only one-third of the patients had a normal ApEn value, whereas long after surgery about 70% of the patients had a normal ApEn value. Although ApEn eventually normalized in about 70% of the operated patients, the cause of the persistence of abnormal GH release in the remainder of the subjects is not known, and might reflect permanent hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction or a very early recurrence of the somatotroph adenoma.

TI  - Is low AT III a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease? Anecdotal observations.  
AB  - I report on my 6-year experience identifying the correlation of low antithrombin III (AT III) levels with coronary artery disease in a rural Missouri family practice setting. I measured plasma AT III levels in 78 patients who were at risk for coronary artery disease. I also tracked lipid profiles, HBA1C, blood pressure, body mass index, hostility, and nicotine use. I measured AT III levels using Baxter Diagnostic AG Dade antithrombin III chromogenic coagulation assays of antithrombin III (normal range, 88% to 126%) at the Boone County Hospital Laboratory, Columbia, Missouri. I analyzed the patient records and looked for the worst recording of each of the above risk factors, selecting the highest blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HBA1C, weight, and age. I selected the lowest AT III level, which often occurred when the patient was stressed. When the worst risk factors were picked over a long period of time, low AT III correlated with an arbitrary coronary artery disease scale 24% of the time. This negative correlation (r = -.49) was higher than any other risk factor in these selected patients.

TI  - Geographical distribution of birth places of children with cancer in the UK.  
AB  - Using birth addresses, we examined the geographical variation in risk for all types of childhood cancers in the UK, on a scale corresponding to the 10-km squares of the National Grid. The effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including natural background radiation, were investigated and their relative importance assessed using Poisson regression. Data came from a national collection of all fatal cancers between 1953 and 1980 in children aged 0-15 years and consisted of 9363 children of known place of birth from 12 complete annual cohorts born in the period 1953-64. For solid cancers, as well as for leukaemias and lymphomas, there was marked variation of cumulative mortality according to place of birth. High mortalities were associated with areas characterized as having high social class, higher incomes and good housing conditions, but also with high population densities (births per hectare). Each of these contrasting social indicators operated independently of the other, indicating complex determining mechanisms. Mortalities increased with increased radon exposure, and the relationship operated independently of the socioeconomic factors. At this scale of analysis, we found no increased mortality in industrialized areas. A population-mixing infective hypothesis, which postulates high rates of leukaemia when highly exposed urban populations are introduced to isolated rural areas, was supported by observations of high mortalities in 'growth areas' and New Towns, but was not readily reconcilable with the high rates seen in the high-density areas. If these correlations do indeed represent an infective mechanism, then the outcomes are not limited to malignancies of the immune system alone.

TI  - A highly sensitive method for large-scale measurements of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  
AB  - A quantitative method for measuring 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) was developed utilizing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the highly inducible 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase promoter in a stably transfected cell line. Transient transfections with constructs containing the 24-hydroxylase gene promoter 5' to a luciferase reporter were first performed in cell lines with high levels of vitamin D receptor, i.e., the rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) and human breast cancer (T-47D) cell lines. ROS 17/2.8 cells, stably transfected with the plasmid, gave a 60-fold stimulation with 10(-10) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. A standard curve was constructed showing a large range of response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 pg to 1 ng). The assay was adapted to microtiter plates, which permits a large number of samples to be assayed simultaneously. Other metabolites of vitamin D and analogs such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 have negligible effects on the detection of 1,25-(OH)2D3, thus eliminating the need for purification of sample. The sensitivity of the method permitted the use of 100 microliters of serum with excellent results. Comparison of this method with a commercially available assay demonstrates that it gives higher sensitivity, simpler manipulations, and comparable results.

TI  - The analysis of short-term growth.  
AB  - The analysis of short-term growth needs repetitive measurements of body stature or of segments of the body. When body stature is measured at monthly intervals, an irregular incremental pattern becomes obvious with a number of large-scale components such as series of prepubertal and pubertal growth spurts, seasonal influences on height gain, and influences of the psychosocial and economic background. When measurement intervals decrease, incremental patterns appear even more irregular, and a number of short-scale components become apparent that are distinct from measurement error. The review summarizes the analysis of short-term growth, and presents the current findings supporting different views on how growth progresses at short term. In particular, observations are presented that suggest growth being a pulsatile, a periodic, a saltatory, and a chaotic event. Some recent animal studies and studies in human newborns are added in detail as they illustrate short-term growth on the basis of accurate 24-hour measurements of the lower leg. The latter investigations support the idea of short-term growth being characterized by chaotic series of'mini growth spurts' that occur at intervals of approximately 4-5 days, not only in human neonates, but also in rats. The amplitude of mini growth spurts ranges between 2 and some 10 mm, and growth velocity of each spurt also varies considerably so that one spurt needs between less than 1 and up to several days for completion.

TI  - Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and polymerase chain reaction-site-specific primers genotyping for HPA-1 alloantigens in an Italian blood donor population.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is increasing interest in the development of rapid and reliable techniques for human platelet alloantigen (HPA) typing. This study investigates the reliability of flow cytometry for large-scale immunophenotyping of platelet alloantigens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction-site-specific primer (PCR-SSP) for the characterization of the human platelet antigen 1 (HPA-1) mosaic in blood donors. RESULTS: By using specific alloantisera and immunofluorescence labelling 9 (2.6%) out of 351 samples were HPA-1a-negative. To confirm this antigenic phenotype, all of the latter samples were submitted to PCR-SSP analysis, showing an HPA1-b/b genomic pattern. In HPA-1a-positive donors, flow cytometry was unable to distinguish HPA-1a/b heterozygous from HPA-1a/a homozygous subjects who were clearly identified by genotyping. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry is a valuable tool for large-scale screening to identify HPA-1a-negative persons, whereas genotyping is the assay of choice for zygosity testing, antenatal diagnosis, and for thrombocytopenic alloimmunized patients.

TI  - Use of the Columbia University Scale to assess psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - The Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease (CUSPAD) was developed as a short, semistructured instrument that can be administered by a clinician or trained lay interviewer to the relatives or caregivers of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). The components of the scale focus on symptoms of psychosis, behavioral disturbance, and depression. A simple decision-tree approach is used to identify the presence of specific psychotic features and makes it possible for the instrument to be used by trained lay interviewers. Interrater reliability has been established. Use of this scale in a multicenter longitudinal study of patients with mild to moderate AD revealed that agitation was the most common and persistent symptom, depressed mood with vegetative signs was the least common and least persistent, and paranoid delusions and hallucinations showed moderate persistence over time. Besides its established psychometric properties, the strengths of the CUSPAD include its brevity, clarity in assessing psychotic symptoms, and ease of administration. These features make it useful for cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation of the symptoms of psychopathology in AD. The main disadvantage is the lack of quantitative ratings of severity for many of the components, making it unsuitable for use in psychopharmacologic trials.

TI  - Do non-dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area play a role in the responses elicited in A10 dopaminergic neurons by electrical stimulation of the prefrontal cortex?  
AB  - It is rapidly becoming apparent that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a major role in controlling the activity of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We have previously demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the PFC elicits inhibition-excitation (IE) and excitation (E) activity patterns in DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA; A10 cell group). Since non-DA neurons in the VTA are cortically innervated, synapse upon DA neurons and appear to have an inhibitory impact, we determined the extent to which the responses of these neurons to stimulation of the PFC could account for the responses seen in DA neurons upon cortical stimulation. Stimulation of the PFC (0.25 mA and 1.0 mA) elicited three categories of response in the majority of VTA non-DA neurons. Types I and II were characterised by a short-to-moderate latency excitation (referred to as "early excitations"), in the latter case preceded by inhibition. Type III responses consisted of inhibition in the absence of an early excitation. Elements of these responses were compared with the temporal characteristics of key elements of responses elicited in DA neurons by PFC stimulation. Although the early excitations in non-DA neurons preceded the inhibitions in DA neurons exhibiting IE responses, the early excitations began approximately 100 ms before the inhibitions in DA neurons and often ended several tens of milliseconds before the inhibitions began, making a causal relationship between these events unlikely. The inhibitions in Type III responses, combined with the inhibitions which followed the early excitations in many Type I and II responses, showed temporal characteristics that suggested a possible causal relationship with the excitations in DA neurons exhibiting E responses, but not those exhibiting IE responses. However, since the excitatory phases of E and IE responses appear to be homologous, the lack of involvement of non-DA neurons in the excitatory phase of IE responses tends to cast doubt on the involvement of non-DA neurons in the excitation during E responses. In fact, the most coherent impression that emerges is that non-DA neurons in the VTA do not influence the activity of A10 DA neurons on a short time-scale (i.e. phasically), but instead may influence activity on a longer time-scale (i.e. tonically).

TI  - Relationships between cognitive behavioral techniques, temperament, observed distress, and pain reports in children and adolescents during lumbar puncture.  
AB  - A limited number of studies have examined relationships between temperament and children's/adolescents' responses to painful procedures and have identified several different dimensions of temperament that are related to children's pain response. The focus of these studies was one-time, acute pain experiences, such as immunization and postoperative pain. In this study, children and adolescents' responses to a moderately painful procedure, lumbar puncture, were examined as they related to temperament. Nineteen children and adolescents, ages 4 to 18 years, who were receiving treatment for cancer, were participants in this study. Parents completed one of three age-appropriate temperament questionnaires at the beginning of the study and prior to the parent and child learning cognitive-behavioral techniques. Behavior during the procedure was videotaped at baseline, and for up to four visits after baseline and coded using the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress (OSBD). Pain reports were collected after the procedure using the Oucher pain self-report scale. Improvement in the level of behavioral distress was determined by examining the differences between pre- and post-treatment OSBD scores and self-reported pain ratings. There was a significant improvement in pain reports over the 5-month period, but behavioral distress did not change significantly. At the baseline visit, the temperament dimensions of more positive mood, lower activity, less persistence, and lower distractibility were related to higher pain reports, but not behavioral distress. However, after 5 months, only the dimension of positive mood was significantly correlated with improvement in pain reports. The amount of time parents and children practiced the techniques, their comfort with the techniques and their perceived effectiveness also were correlated with positive mood.

TI  - High-speed magic-angle spinning 13C MAS NMR spectra of adamantane: self-decoupling of the heteronuclear scalar interaction and proton spin diffusion.  
AB  - We have investigated the carbon line shape of solid adamantane under high-speed magic-angle sample spinning (MAS) acquired without proton decoupling. The CH-group shows a spinning-speed-dependent line broadening while the CH2-group consists of a spinning-speed-independent sharp component and a spinning-speed-dependent broader part. These phenomena can be explained by self-decoupling of the J-interaction due to proton spin diffusion. Such a self-decoupling process can be described by a magnetization exchange process between the multiplet lines. Changing the spin-diffusion rate constant by off-resonance irradiation of the protons allows us to observe the full range from slow exchange to coalescence to fast exchange of the carbon spectra. One of the multiplet components in the CH2-group corresponds to a group spin of the protons of zero and therefore does not couple to the other protons. This gives rise to the sharp central line. The magnetization exchange rate constant between the different multiplet lines can be determined from the spectra and is a measure for the spinning-speed-dependent proton spin-diffusion rate constant. Even at an MAS speed of 30 kHz, proton spin diffusion is still observable despite the relatively weak intermolecular proton dipolar-coupling network in adamantane which results in a static proton line width of only 14 kHz (full width at half height).

TI  - Cross-cultural adaptation of the hearing handicap inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S) for use with Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To cross-culturally adapt the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S) for use with older Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Two different samples were used. First, a convenience sample of 100 older community-dwelling Mexican American men and women in San Antonio, Texas, was used to test technical equivalence of the Spanish and English language versions of the HHIE-S. Second, a neighborhood-based sample of older Mexican Americans was used to establish conceptual (n = 433) and criterion equivalence (n = 381) of the two HHIE-S language versions. METHODS: Independent forward and back translations were done to create a Spanish language version of the HHIE-S. In the convenience sample, subjects were administered the English and Spanish HHIE-S in random order on separate days. In the neighborhood sample, the HHIE-S was given on one occasion in the language of the subject's preference. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression scale to see if the two language versions of the HHIE-S were similarly associated with depression (conceptual equivalence). Hearing impairment was assessed using the Welch-Allyn Audioscope to see if the two language versions were similarly associated with an audiometric measure for hearing loss (criterion equivalence). RESULTS: In the convenience sample, the overall mean (SD) Spanish and English HHIE-S scores were 6.2 (8.7) and 6.2 (9.3), respectively (P = 1.00). Total scores of the English and Spanish versions were highly correlated (r = .89), and regression analysis indicated that the two language versions gave nearly identical results. In the neighborhood-based sample, men had higher HHIE-S scores than women (OR 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3-3.5). Having depressive symptoms (OR 3.2, 95% CI = 1.9-5.5) or hearing impairment (OR 6.1, 95% CI = 3.5-10.5) was associated with higher HHIE-S scores. After adjustment for gender, depressive symptoms, and/or hearing impairment, the language of interview was not associated with HHIE-S score. CONCLUSION: We have developed and tested a Spanish translation of the HHIE-S that yields equivalent results to those obtained with the English version in bilingual Mexican Americans. The Spanish HHIE-S presented here is suitable for clinical use and research studies involving older Mexican Americans.

TI  - Whole blood selenium in exudative age-related maculopathy.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We tested whether exudative ARM was associated with low whole blood levels of selenium (Se). METHODS: Blood samples, drawn from 10 exudative ARM patients (61.2-76.1 yr) and 9 healthy-eyed (66.9-75.1 yr) subjects, were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. RESULTS: Selenium concentration was significantly lower in the ARM group (186.6 microg/l) than in controls (207.0 microg/l). Because many ARM patients took Se supplements, we tested the effect on blood Se of 80 microg per day of sodium selenate. We found no enduring effects of supplementation for healthy-eyed, younger adults. CONCLUSIONS: Significant group differences in this preliminary study indicate a larger-scale study of blood Se concentration in exudative ARM patients is warranted. If the effect of Se supplementation on the progression of exudative ARM is tested in future trials, it will be important to use organic Se, to identify the components of blood affected, and to observe protocol for at least six months.

TI  - Splenic para-amyloid material: a possible vasculopathy of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  
AB  - We have observed perivascular para-amyloid in the spleens of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients at autopsy. Whether this phenomenon is unique to AIDS patients or is a common degenerative phenomenon in the spleen has not been determined. Autopsy spleens from 355 patients (171 AIDS, 184 non-AIDS) were graded for presence of splenic para-amyloid material (SPAM) on a scale of 0 to 3. The average ages of the AIDS and non-AIDS groups were 38.4 and 60.4 years, respectively. All SPAM-positive AIDS cases had age-matched non-AIDS controls. Selected positive cases were examined ultrastructurally. Of the 171 AIDS patients, 55 had SPAM; in 30 cases, it was considered grade 2 or 3. Although none of the non-AIDS cases were graded 2 or 3, eight of them were grade 1. SPAM is highly correlated with AIDS (32.1 v 4.3%; P < .0001), with a specificity of 95.6% and a positive predictive value of 87.3%. These perivascular deposits correspond to areas of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths and appear to be in continuity with arteriolar adventitia. Ultrastructurally, they contain collagen, long-spaced collagen, fibrillin, and occasional residual cells. No viral particles were noted. SPAM appears to be more prevalent and in greater quantity in AIDS patients. It does not correlate with advanced age; it can be mistaken for amyloid. Its consistent association with the adventitia of vessels raises the possibility of a new vasculopathy of AIDS; it also may be related to follicular involution and hyalinization associated with regression of prior follicular hyperplasia.

TI  - From Kilimanjaro to the Himalayas: studies of health determinants in Third World communities.  
AB  - Studies in communities in developing countries may seem far from occupational medicine in the UK, but there is much in common. Poverty and inequality, and the lack of control and choices that follow, are important causes of ill health. The methodology described in this paper is based on the concept that measurement should itself contribute to development and empower people. It combines quantitative data from large scale household surveys with qualitative data from focus groups, key informants and institutional reviews. In Nepal, malnutrition in children is seen to be related not only to feeding practices but also to the status of women. In Uganda, highlighting areas of poor service delivery in health and agriculture has initiated dialogue about improving local delivery of these services. In Tanzania, corruption in public services adversely affects everyday life; the survey results are part of an integrated strategy to tackle the problem.

TI  - Eleven peak flow meters: a clinical evaluation [see comments]  
AB  - Peak flow meters are essential tools in the management of asthma. Many types are on the market. A computer-driven piston pump is normally not available for evaluation of the various meters. Comparison with values from a pneumotachograph is an accepted way of testing peak flow meters. This study aims at comparing 11 peak flow meters, for accuracy and linearity. Seven adult peak flow meters were tested: Miniwright with an equidistant scale (Clement Clarke); Personal Best (Healthscan); Wright Pocket fdE (Ferraris); Vitalograph (Vitalograph); Assess (Healthscan); Pocket Peak flow meter (Micro Medical); and Truzone (Monaghan). Furthermore, four low-range (LR) peak flow meters were tested: LR Miniwright with equidistant scale (Clement Clarke); LR Personal Best (Healthscan); LR Wright Pocket (LR Ferraris); and LR Pocket peak flow meter (LR Micro Medical). Two test series were performed: in the first one, a peak flow meter was connected downstream in series with a Fleisch #4 pneumotachograph. One subject performed 50 partial forced expiratory manoeuvres through this ensemble. In the second series, 50 adult patients and 25 healthy children performed sequential maximal forced expiratory manoeuvres on each peak flow meter, and on the pneumotachograph. A ranking system was devised for the various parameters of agreement of the meters with the pneumotachograph. Substantial differences in the quality of the adult meters were found. The adult peak flow meters with the closest agreement to the pneumotachograph were Personal Best and Micro Medical. In the low-range peak flow meters, the lowest differences were seen in the LR Personal Best and LR Micro Medical.

TI  - A simultaneous comparison of three neonatal pain scales during common NICU procedures.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated neonatal pain scales during procedures commonly performed in a neonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN: Evaluated were the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), the Comfort scale, and a new scale known as the Scale for Use in Newborns (SUN). Four procedures were scored: intubation, intravenous catheter insertion, endotracheal tube suctioning, and diaper changes. Scoring was done before, during, and after each procedure. Thirty-three patients were tested during 68 procedures with 1,428 scale scores. RESULTS: All scales demonstrated significant changes. In before-versus-during for each procedure, the increase in pain scale score was significant for the NIPS, Comfort scale, and SUN. All three scales also demonstrated a return to baseline (before-vs.-after) for the four procedures, except for the Comfort scale, which remained elevated (p < .05) following diaper change. The NIPS had a significantly larger coefficient of variation (CV, 188% +/- 99%), whereas the Comfort scale and SUN had small CVs (27% +/- 5% and 33% +/- 8%, respectively). In evaluating potential confounding influences, it was found that infants > 2.5 kg on sedative or analgesic medications appeared to have procedure-related accentuation and sustained elevation in scale scores, whereas swaddling seemed to provide little added benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The pain scale scores identify changes in an infant's behavior/physiologic state. It is unclear whether these changes are totally "pain specific." In comparing the three scales, the SUN overall was a preferable tool because of its ease of use, scale symmetry, and scoring consistency.

TI  - Peer review in the Croatian Medical Journal from 1992 to 1996.  
AB  - We analyzed the peer review process in the Croatian Medical Journal (CMJ) from 1992 to 1996 by a retrospective analysis of review forms for 319 manuscripts. The forms asked about manuscript's structure (7 questions), its scientific value (7-item scale), clarity and length, and final recommendation (5-item scale). An international manuscript had at least one author affiliated with a non-Croatian institution. The overall rejection rate of manuscripts was 23.5%. National and international manuscripts had similar rejection rates except for original research manuscripts in clinical sciences (34.7% vs. 18.9%, p=0.046). Out-door peer review was asked for 77.4% of the manuscripts; other manuscripts were commissioned and passed an in-house review. Over the years, the number of international reviewers increased, and that of national reviewers decreased. National reviewers more often did not fill in the review form, and international reviewers more often asked for a major revision. The agreement between reviewers ranged from 34.1% (scientific value) to 90.7% (reference citations). Kappa for inter-rater agreement was poor to fair, without difference between national and international manuscripts. International manuscripts had shorter median review time (from receipt to decision) and publishing time (from acceptance to publication) than national manuscripts: 58 vs. 112 days (p<0.001), and 116 vs. 140 days (p<0.009), respectively. Our analysis shows that peer review can be introduced and sustained in a small journal from the scientific periphery. It can be fair both to national and international manuscripts, although work with the authors of national manuscripts may be needed to improve the quality of data presentation.

TI  - A multivariate logistic regression analysis in predicting malignancy for patients with ovarian tumors.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to improve the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian malignancy using a multivariate logistic regression analysis on the basis of demographic, serologic, gray-scale morphological, and Doppler variables. METHODS: One hundred seventy-one patients with ovarian tumors (120 benign, 51 malignant including 9 tumors of low malignant potential) were studied with transvaginal B-mode, color, and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography before surgery. Based on the gray-scale ultrasound imaging, each tumor was classified as a unilocular cyst, multilocular cyst, unilocular cyst with solid parts, multilocular cyst with solid parts, or solid tumor. Intratumoral blood flow velocity waveforms were recorded on all tumors except unilocular cyst and were evaluated for resistance index (RI) and peak systolic velocity (PSV). Serum CA 125 levels were also measured. RESULTS: Twenty tumors were unilocular cysts and were all benign. Seventy tumors including all unilocular cysts which showed no flows were all benign. The remaining 101 tumors (50 benign, 51 malignant including 9 tumors of low malignant potential) presented intratumoral blood flows. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify variables predictive of ovarian malignancy in these 101 tumors. The variables included age, menstrual state, serum CA 125 levels, B-mode classification, RI, and PSV. In univariate analysis, menopause, the positivity of CA 125 (> or = 35 U/ml), and PSV larger than or equal to 10.4 cm/s were found to be significantly associated with malignant tumors. The PSV value of 10.4 cm/s was the median in benign tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that serum CA 125 levels (> or = 35 U/ml) (P = 0.002) and PSV (> or = 10.4 cm/s) (P < 0.001) were to be independent predictors of malignancy. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that intratumoral PSV is the strongest means of differentiating benign from malignant ovarian tumors with suspicious gray-scale ultrasonographic findings.

TI  - Oral versus written feedback in medical clinic.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether residents perceived oral, face-to-face feedback about their continuity clinic performance as better than a similar, written version. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two university-based, internal medicine residency clinics. PARTICIPANTS: All 68 internal medicine and combined program (medicine-pediatrics, medicine-psychiatry, medicine-neurology, and preliminary year) residents and their clinic preceptors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Residents at each program were separately randomized to oral or written feedback sessions with their clinic preceptors. The oral and written sessions followed similar, structured formats. Both groups were later sent questionnaires about aspects of the clinic. Sixty-five (96%) of the residents completed the questionnaire. Eight of the 19 questions dealt with aspects of feedback. A feedback scale was developed from the survey responses to those eight questions (alpha = .86). There were no significant differences in the responses to individual questions or in scale means (p > .20) between the two feedback groups. When each university was analyzed separately, one had a higher scale mean (3.10 vs 3.57, p = .047), but within each university, there were no differences between the oral and written feedback groups (p > .20). CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed between the oral and written feedback groups. In attempting to provide better feedback to their residents, medical educators may better apply their efforts to other aspects, such as the frequency of their feedback, rather than the form of its delivery.

TI  - Norms for the physical and mental health component summary scores of the SF-36 for young, middle-aged and older Australian women.  
AB  - The SF-36 was developed in the USA to provide an eight-scale health profile and two component summary scores representing physical and mental health. The published norms and scoring procedures are based on data from the US general population. The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (Women's Health Australia) undertook a survey in 1996 of approximately 42,000 Australian women in three age groups of 18-22, 45-49 and 70-74 years and provided age- and gender-specific norms for the SF-36 health profile. From these data, factor weights and factor score coefficients were calculated for these age- and gender-specific populations of Australian women. Thus, component summary scores for physical and mental health can now be calculated using a formula standardized to the relevant Australian population. This will facilitate the interpretation of the physical and mental health component summary scores in the Australian context and will allow meaningful comparisons within the young, middle-aged and older cohorts of Australian women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.

TI  - Cognitive progress associated with gambling behaviour.  
AB  - Gambling behaviours can be pathological if positive response is extreme, but very little is known about the psychological precursors of pathological gambling in Australia. This study examined the relationships between self-reported gambling behaviours and scores on locus of control measures. The sample of 80 male and 75 female undergraduate students completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen and Levenson's multidimensional Locus of Control Scale. No significant association was found for the self-reported gambling behaviours with scores on the Internal scale but a positive one obtained between scores on the Powerful Others subscale. Self-reported gambling behaviours differed significantly for men reported that they gambled more than women. For these Australian undergraduates an additional question on borrowing money increased the apparent frequency of pathological gambling. Thus an avenue for further research is the development of a valid and reliable measure of gambling behaviours in an Australian sample.

TI  - Dynamics of different functional parts of bacteriorhodopsin: H-2H labeling and neutron scattering [see comments]  
AB  - We show that dynamics of specific amino acids within a protein can be characterized by neutron spectroscopy and hydrogen-deuterium labeling, and we present data on the motions of a selected set of groups within bacteriorhodopsin (BR), the retinal-based proton pump in the purple membrane of halophilic Archaea. Elastic incoherent neutron scattering experiments allow the definition of motions in the nano- to picosecond time scale and have revealed a dynamical transition from a harmonic to a softer, anharmonic atomic fluctuation regime in the global behavior of proteins. Biological activity in proteins is correlated with this transition, suggesting that flexibility is required for function. Elastic incoherent neutron scattering is dominated by H atom scattering, and to study the dynamics of a selected part of BR, fully deuterated purple membrane with BR containing H-retinal, H-tryptophan, and H-methionine was prepared biosynthetically in Halobacterium salinarum. These amino acids cluster in the functional center of the protein. In contrast to the protein globally, the thermal motions of the labeled atoms were found to be shielded from solvent melting effects at 260 K. Above this temperature, the labeled groups appear as more rigid than the rest of the protein, with a significantly smaller mean square amplitude of motion. These experimental results quantify the dynamical heterogeneity of BR (which meets the functional requirements of global flexibility), on the one hand, to allow large conformational changes in the molecule and of a more rigid region in the protein, on the other, to control stereo-specific selection of retinal conformations.

TI  - Optimization considerations for the purification of alpha1-antitrypsin using silica-based ion-exchange adsorbents in packed and expanded beds.  
AB  - The influences of the fluid superficial velocity, sample concentration, loading volume, and wash cycle on the recovery and corresponding purification factors for alpha1-antitrypsin [syn. alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI)] from crude mixtures of human plasma proteins were investigated using packed and expanded beds of DEAE-Spherodex LS. As part of this study, the effect of fluid superficial velocity on the bed dispersion number (Dv) and dispersion coefficient (D) for this adsorbent in expanded beds was determined with feedstocks containing human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant of the contaminating proteins in human plasma protein preparations used for the isolation of alpha1-PI. When multicomponent protein feedstocks prepared from human plasma were examined with DEAE-Spherodex LS, reduced chromatographic productivity was observed for alpha1-PI as the extent of column utilization and the superficial velocity were increased, yet the opposite trend was evident for HSA. In particular, higher adsorption capacities and recoveries were obtained for alpha1-PI at lower fluid superficial velocities with both packed and expanded bed conditions. These findings indicate that for process scale purifications of alpha1-PI from multicomponent feedstocks with expanded beds containing this silica-based ion-exchange adsorbent, the optimal range of superficial velocities to achieve the highest bed productivity will not be synonymous with maximally fluidized modes of operation. Rather, the results confirm that the adsorbent has an optimum operational performance when fluidization procedures corresponding to plug flow expansion are employed for the capture of alpha1-PI. These findings also indicate that advantage can be taken of displacement effects between closely related protein species with packed and expanded bed systems containing the DEAE-Spherodex LS type of ion-exchange porous silicas.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the construct validity of the Hoensbroeck Disability Scale for Brain Injury (HDSB) against the Disability Rating Scale (DRS). METHODS: The HDSB was correlated with the DRS at admission, 6 weeks later and at discharge in 33 brain injured patients during post-acute rehabilitation. Next, to study the longitudinal construct validity of the HDSB the mean changes in score of the HDSB and the DRS were correlated. Finally, the sensitivity to change over a 6-week period was evaluated by comparison of the effect sizes of the HDSB scores with the DRS scores. RESULTS: The HDSB subscales correlate high and in the expected direction with the DRS at all three points in time. The correlation of the changes between HDSB and DRS is moderate, but in the expected direction. The sensitivity to change in time of the HDSB is lower than that of the DRS. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the validity of the HDSB as an instrument to describe the disability of acquired brain injury patients at a single point in time. Its ability to measure changes in disability over time is questionable and needs further investigation.

TI  - Lower precombat intelligence is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder.  
AB  - The authors examined the relation between intelligence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by studying the association among precombat intelligence, current intelligence, and self-reported PTSD symptoms. Military aptitude test results were obtained in 59 PTSD and 31 non-PTSD Vietnam combat veterans who had undergone a psychodiagnostic interview and current intelligence testing. People with lower precombat intelligence were more likely to develop PTSD symptoms as assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale even after adjustment for extent of combat exposure. The association between current intelligence and PTSD was no longer significant after adjusting for precombat intelligence. These results suggest that lower pretrauma intelligence increases risk for developing PTSD symptoms, not that PTSD lowers performance on intelligence tests.

TI  - Human general transcription factor TFIIB: conformational variability and interaction with VP16 activation domain.  
AB  - Human TFIIB, an essential factor in transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II, consists of an amino-terminal zinc binding domain (TFIIBn) connected by a linker of about 60 residues to a carboxy-terminal core domain (TFIIBc). The TFIIB core domain has two internally repeated motifs, each comprising five alpha-helices arranged as in the cyclin box. Compared to the crystal structure of TFIIBc in complex with TBP and a TATA-containing oligonucleotide, the NMR-derived solution structure of free TFIIBc is more compact, with a different repeat-repeat orientation and a significantly shorter first helix in the second repeat. Analysis of backbone 15N relaxation parameters indicates the presence of relatively large amplitude, nanosecond time-scale motions in the TFIIBc interrepeat linker and structural fluctuations throughout the backbone. Interaction of TFIIBc with the acidic activation domain of VP16 or with TFIIBn induces 1H-15N chemical shift and line width changes concentrated in the first repeat, interrepeat linker and the first helix of the second repeat. These results suggest that TFIIB is somewhat pliable and that the conformation of the C-terminal core domain can be modulated by interaction with the N-terminal zinc binding domain. Furthermore, binding of the VP16 activation domain may promote TFIIBc conformations primed for binding to a TBP-DNA complex.

TI  - The reproducibility of a method to identify the overuse and underuse of medical procedures [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the overuse and underuse of medical procedures, various methods have been developed, but their reproducibility has not been evaluated. This study estimates the reproducibility of one commonly used method. METHODS: We performed a parallel, three-way replication of the RAND-University of California at Los Angeles appropriateness method as applied to two medical procedures, coronary revascularization and hysterectomy. Three nine-member multidisciplinary panels of experts were composed for each procedure by stratified random sampling from a list of experts nominated by the relevant specialty societies. Each panel independently rated the same set of clinical scenarios in terms of the appropriateness of the relevant procedure on a risk-benefit scale ranging from 1 to 9. Final ratings were used to classify the procedure in each scenario as necessary or not necessary (to evaluate underuse) and inappropriate or not inappropriate (to evaluate overuse). Reproducibility was measured by overall agreement and by the kappa statistic. The criteria for underuse and overuse derived from these ratings were then applied to real populations of patients who had undergone coronary revascularization or hysterectomy. RESULTS: The rates of agreement among the three coronary-revascularization panels were 95, 94, and 96 percent for inappropriate-use scenarios and 93, 92, and 92 percent for necessary-use scenarios. Agreement among the three hysterectomy panels was 88, 70, and 74 percent for inappropriate-use scenarios. Scenarios involving necessary use of hysterectomy were not assessed. The three-way kappa statistic to detect overuse was 0.52 for coronary revascularization and 0.51 for hysterectomy. The three-way kappa statistic to detect underuse of coronary revascularization was 0.83. Application of individual panels' criteria to real populations of patients resulted in a 100 percent variation in the proportion of cases classified as inappropriate and a 20 percent variation in the proportion of cases classified as necessary. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriateness method is far from perfect. Appropriateness criteria may be useful in comparing levels of appropriate procedures among populations but should not by themselves be used to direct care for individual patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether acutely psychotic first-episode schizophrenics show an increased cerebral blood flow velocity and whether this condition is reversible on psychopathological improvement. METHODS: In the first of two examinations, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and assessment with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were performed on 28 acutely psychotic, neuroleptically naive, first-episode schizophrenics. In the second examination, the same patients were assessed psychometrically (PANSS) as well as with Doppler ultrasonography after psychopathological improvement. RESULTS: Acutely psychotic first-episode schizophrenics showed a significant increase of the mean velocity on both sides in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries and in the right posterior cerebral artery. Blood flow showed significant correlations with productive psychotic symptoms. After psychopathological improvement there was a bilateral normalization of the mean velocity in the middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Acutely psychotic first-episode schizophrenics show a significantly increased bilateral cerebral blood flow velocity, which normalizes on psychopathological improvement. There were significant correlations of cerebral blood flow velocity with psychopathology.

PROCEDURE: Dogs were allocated into 3 groups (group 1, 25 dogs assessed 1 hour after the end of surgery; group 2, 41 dogs assessed between 21 and 27 hours after the end of surgery; group 3, 16 dogs assessed on the day of surgery and on the subsequent day). Each dog was scored for pain 4 times by 3 (groups 1 and 3) or 4 (group 2) veterinarians, using all 3 scales (i.e. simple descriptive, numerical rating, and visual analogue) during each scoring period. Analysis of data was performed using ANOVA, log-linear modeling, calculation of reproducibility coefficients, and Cohen's kappa statistic. RESULTS: Significant variability existed among observers for use of all 3 scales. Variability among observers and between observers and dogs accounted for 29 to 36% of the total variability (group 1, 36.1 and 32.3% and group 2, 35.1 and 29.7%, for visual analogue scale and numerical rating scale scores, respectively). Kappa statistic values calculated for data obtained by use of the simple descriptive scale indicated that agreement was fair for the observers (group 1, 0.244 to 0.299; group 2, 0.211 to 0.368; group 3, 0.233 to 0.321). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Analysis of pain score data in dogs must incorporate observer variability when more than 1 observer is used. Comparative analysis of data accrued from pain studies in various hospitals must account for this variability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Henry Armaignac, a French ophthalmologist in the early twentieth century, criticized the Monoyer optometric scale, which was used to measure visual acuity. METHODS: This article discusses the "optometric scale" for visual acuity letter sizes proposed by Armaignac in a 1906 publication. CONCLUSION: Armaignac pointed out the flaws of the Monoyer visual acuity chart commonly used in France at the time and suggested an improvement in the progression of letter sizes on the chart.

TI  - Lymph node staging in non-small-cell lung cancer with FDG-PET scan: a prospective study on 690 lymph node stations from 68 patients.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the accuracy of computed tomography-(CT) scan and the radiolabeled glucose analog 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) visually correlated with CT (PET + CT) in the locoregional lymph node (LN) staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with potentially operable NSCLC underwent thoracic CT, PET, and invasive surgical staging (ISS). Imaging studies were read prospectively and blinded to the surgical and pathologic data.  A five-point visual scale was used for the interpretation of LNs on PET. Afterwards, with knowledge of the pathology, the relationship between standardized uptake values (SUVs) and the presence of metastasis in LNs was explored in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the likelihood ratios (LRs) for SUVs of LNs were determined. RESULTS: ISS was available for 690 LN stations. CT correctly identified the nodal stage in 40 of 68 patients (59%), with understaging in 12 patients and overstaging in 16 patients. PET + CT was accurate in 59 patients (87%), with understaging in five patients and overstaging in four patients. In the detection of locally advanced disease (N2/N3), the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 75%, 63%, and 68%, respectively. For PET + CT, this was 93%, 95%, and 94% (P = .0004). In the ROC curve, the best SUV threshold to distinguish benign from malignant LNs was 4.40. The analysis with this SUV threshold was not superior to the use of a five-point visual scale. The LR of a SUV less than 3.5 in an LN was 0.152; for a SUV between 3.5 and 4.5, it was 3.157; and for a SUV greater than 4.5, it was 253.096. CONCLUSION: PET + CT is significantly more accurate than CT alone in LN staging of NSCLC. A five-point visual scale is as accurate as the use of an SUV threshold for LNs in the distinction between benign and malignant nodes. The very high negative predictive value of mediastinal PET could reduce the need for mediastinal ISS in NSCLC substantially.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus and depression in drug users.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical case studies have implicated depression as a possible side-effect of interferon treatment for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, because these studies generally did not include a pretreatment assessment of depression, it cannot be definitively stated whether depression is a side-effect of interferon treatment, a syndrome coexisting with HCV, or a common characteristic of individuals who are vulnerable to HCV infection. To gather more information about this issue, self-reported depressive symptomatology of drug users with HCV who have not received interferon treatment was compared to that of uninfected drug users. METHODS: Subjects were 309 drug users not currently in substance abuse treatment who were participating in a National Institute on Drug Abuse project. Subjects completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) instrument and provided a blood sample for HCV testing. RESULTS: Serological findings revealed that 52.4% of the subjects tested positive for HCV antibodies. Of the HCV-positive subjects, 57.2% had significant depressive symptomatology, whereas only 48.2% of the HCV-negative subjects did, for an overall rate of 52.6%. The two groups also differed on two specific dimensions of depression, with the HCV-positive group scoring lower on the Positive Affect scale and higher on the Somatic/Retarded Activity scale. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal high levels of depressive symptomatology among drug users, as well as the possibility of a coexisting depressive syndrome with HCV infection. These findings raise the possibility that depression associated with interferon treatment may, at least partially, be accounted for by preexisting depression. Further research is needed to determine the nature and origins of depression in individuals in treatment with interferon for HCV with specific focus placed on determining the dimensions of depression associated with HCV infection and interferon treatment.

TI  - [Acceptance of breast feeding and public discussion--evaluation of health campaigns for breast feeding between 1991 and 1995]  
AB  - In 1990 the Innocenti Declaration on promoting breastfeeding was proclaimed in Florence/Italy. It became the subject of resolution 45.34 of the World Health Assembly in 1992. In the Federal Republic of Germany there was no wide-scale mass-media campaign to promote breastfeeding as in other countries. But mother-to-mother support groups, medical services and the newly founded National Breastfeeding Committee supported prolonged breastfeeding in public. The effects of the joint effort could be estimated by comparing the results of two postal surveys in 1991 and 1995. The surveys were conducted in Lower Saxony, North-Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin. A tendency could be shown toward more exclusive breastfeeding. Breastfeeding with supplementary food increased by a factor of 1.3 after adjusting for the variables mother's age, sleeping in parents' room or bed and no-smoking household. In Lower Saxony the increase was by a factor of 1.5 starting from a lower base value. The baby sleeping in the parents' room or in their bed furthered breastfeeding by a factor of 1.5 to 4. Non smoking mothers are 4 times more willing to breastfeed their infants than smoking mothers. German mothers breastfeed their infants two to three times more often than turkish mothers.

TI  - Postoperative epidural injection of saline can shorten postanesthesia care unit time for knee arthroscopy patients.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The goal of this prospective, double-blind study was to ascertain if the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay of outpatients receiving epidural anesthesia for knee arthroscopy is decreased by injection of epidural saline at the end of the case. METHODS: Twenty healthy patients undergoing knee arthroscopy received lumbar epidural anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. At the end of surgery, in a double-blind design, group 1 patients (intervention group) received 20 mL 0.9% saline injected into the epidural catheter. Patients in group 2 (control group) had 1 mL 0.9% saline injected into the epidural catheter. In the PACU, the epidural catheter was removed, and motor block was assessed at 15-minute intervals according to the Bromage scale. Standard discharge criteria for our ambulatory surgery center were followed. RESULTS: Patients who received 20 mL epidural 0.9% saline remained in phase I (intensive nursing) 83 +/- 8 minutes compared with control patients who stayed 110 +/- 8 minutes (P < .01). Nonmedical issues related to the unavailability of the patients transportation or waiting for medications to be issued from the pharmacy delayed discharge from phase II (non-nursing) in 70% of group 1 patients and 60% of group 2 patients. Time to actual hospital dismissal for group I was 119 +/- 14 minutes, compared with 159 +/- 13 minutes (P < .05) for group 2. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving epidural anesthesia for knee arthroscopy had a shorter PACU stay if they received an injection of saline into the epidural space at the end of surgery.

TI  - Neurologic sequelae associated with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies of the incidence of neurologic disturbances after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest produced conflicting results. This article reviews the results of the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study, and another study undertaken to compare neurologic outcome in infants after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest using alpha-stat and pH-stat strategies. METHODS: The study population in the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study consisted of 171 infants less than 3 months of age. Neurologic outcomes were evaluated perioperatively, at 1 year, and at 4 years. The study population in the alpha-stat versus pH-stat study consisted of 182 infants no older than 9 months of age. Patients were evaluated for postoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) and clinical seizures, recovery time to first EEG activity, and postoperative mortality and morbidity. RESULTS: After about 30 minutes of circulatory arrest there was increasing probability of perioperative clinical seizures, EEG seizures, and increased time to recovery of EEG activity. One-year evaluations showed a significant relation of duration of circulatory arrest to lowered psychomotor developmental index and increased neurologic abnormalities. Four-year evaluations showed no difference between low-flow and circulatory-arrest patients in results of neurologic examination or in full-scale general IQ, although there was an effect of circulatory arrest duration on various subscores of cognitive function. Compared with the pH-stat strategy, the alpha-stat strategy tended to be associated with more EEG seizures and higher postoperative morbidity and mortality, and was significantly associated with longer recovery time to first EEG activity. CONCLUSIONS: These studies strongly suggest that in infants undergoing open heart operations for complex congenital heart defects, low-flow bypass is associated with better neurologic outcome than is circulatory arrest and that the pH-stat strategy is associated with a better outcome than the alpha-stat strategy when circulatory arrest is used.

TI  - Thermal denaturation of ribonuclease A characterized by water 17O and 2H magnetic relaxation dispersion.  
AB  - Water oxygen-17 and deuteron nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) measurements were used to characterize ribonuclease A (RNase A) in the course of thermal denaturation at pH 2 and 4. The structure and dynamics of the protein were probed by specific long-lived water molecules, by the short-lived surface hydration, and by labile side-chain hydrogens. The NMRD data show that native RNase A contains at least three water molecules with a mean residence time of 8 ns at 27 degreesC and an activation enthalpy of ca. 40 kJ mol-1. These water molecules are identified with some or all of six ordered water molecules partly buried in surface pockets in the crystal structure of RNase A. The loss of the 17O dispersion at higher temperatures demonstrates that, in the thermally denatured protein, these surface pockets are either not present or undergoing large structural fluctuations on a subnanosecond time scale. The relaxation dispersion step vanishes monotonically and essentially in concert with the CD denaturation curves, thus ruling out the existence of equilibrium intermediates with a substantial amount of non-native and long-lived hydration water. The NMRD data show that thermally denatured RNase A has a relatively compact but highly flexible structure. The global solvent exposure and the hydrodynamic volume of the denatured protein are much less than for maximally unfolded disulfide-intact RNase A. The NMRD data show that thermal denaturation is accompanied by a large reduction of the mean-square orientational order parameter of side-chain O-H bonds, implying that, in the denatured state, these side chains sample a wide distribution of conformational states on a subnanosecond time scale.

TI  - Improving the specific gravity adjustment method for assessing urinary concentrations of toxic substances.  
AB  - Changes in urinary flow induce changes in urinary concentrations of toxic substances. The authors modified the conventional specific gravity adjustment method for measuring urinary concentration of toxic substances to compensate for the dilution effects from varying degrees of hydration. The conventional specific gravity adjustment method is a special case to the more general method proposed in this article. The conventional method generally does not correct the urinary concentration to the mean specific gravity of urine. It requires the assumption that a change in urine flow preserves the relative ratio between the mass of the xenobiotic and the mass of total dissolved solids. The derivation of the modified specific gravity adjustment method shows that a change in urine flow does not necessarily preserve this ratio. An experimental slope between urinary flow and urinary specific gravity was linear on a log scale. A ratio was formed between the experimental slope and Araki's "b" slopes for various substances to predict changes in urine concentrations due to changes in the specific gravity of a spot sample. Since excretion rates typically vary for different substances with changes in urinary flow, an appropriately weighted exponential adjustment factor is required for each substance to normalize its concentration to the standard specific gravity of urine.

TI  - Interrater reliability of neurologic soft signs in an acquired brain injury population.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the interrater reliability of a battery of tests that assess for neurologic soft signs in an acquired brain injury population. STUDY DESIGN: Correlation study of the battery's interrater reliability. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient acquired brain injury rehabilitation program. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen patients with an acquired brain injury and two control subjects. METHODS: The battery of tests for neurologic soft signs was administered to all 16 subjects. Each subject was videotaped. Fifteen "nonexpert" allied health professionals independently rated the subjects' performances. Two scoring systems were used. All neurologic soft signs were rated on an ordinal scale, and, where possible, a quantitative measure of performance was recorded. RESULTS: Using the ordinal scale scoring system, all neurologic soft signs had interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of > or =.60. The signs "Two-Point Discrimination" and "Go-No-Go part 1 and part 2" achieved ICCs of > or = .75. For the scoring system requiring a quantitative measure of performance, ICCs ranged from .18 to .97. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic soft signs administered to an acquired brain injury population can be reliably rated by "nonexpert" clinicians. The signs should be rated on an ordinal scale.

AB  - The psychometric properties of the OARS ADL scale, comprised of seven physical activities of daily living (PADL) and seven instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) items, were examined using a Rasch measurement approach. Two of the PADL items failed to demonstrate acceptable goodness-of-fit with the measurement model but the remaining 12 items could be combined into a single measure of ADL ability. Although the OARS ADL scale was designed to identify those community-dwelling elderly who need supports and services to continue to live in the community, the scale items were found to be poorly targeted to community-dwelling elderly since almost half of our sample received maximal scores. Rasch analysis identified how we might improve the sensitivity of the OARS ADL scale but its utility in outcome and longitudinal studies remains questionable.

Extraversion correlated positively and Neuroticism correlated negatively with Self-Deceptive Enhancement, whereas Psychoticism correlated negatively and the Lie scale correlated positively with Impression Management. These findings suggest that the EPQ-R scales are involved in different aspects of socially desirable responding.

Using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, this study considered the effects of the trait (a personality characteristic), and the state (a response to stressful stimuli) of anxiety to perceived burnout. Analysis showed that scores on both trait and state anxiety were significantly related to scores on burnout. Moderators, including characteristics of the work environment, as measured by selected subscales of the Work Environment Scale were evaluated for their influence on the anxiety-burnout linkage. Peer and supervisory support, age, and prior knowledge of work-day situations moderated anxiety about burnout. Other work environment factors functioned as independent predictors of burnout.

TI  - The role of recombinant human erythropoietin in the treatment of thalassemia.  
AB  - The rationale for treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in thalassemia came from studies in baboons, thalassemic mice and in erythroid cultures. The results demonstrated an increase in gamma globin synthesis and consequently in fetal Hb (Hb F) resulting in improvement in erythropoietic parameters. In addition, endogenous serum Epo levels in various forms of thalassemia were inconsistent and not related to the severity of the anemia. Therefore, several preliminary studies with rHuEPO were performed, mainly on patients with beta thalassemia intermedia. The results indicate: a) a significant, dose-related (500 u/kg to 1000 u/kg x 3/week) increase in thalassemia erythropoiesis without changes in % of Hb F, MCV and MCH, mainly in splenectomized patients; b) the minimum effective dose is 500 u/kg x 3/week; c) there were no major side effects during the continuous treatment period of 9 months. In order to improve both quantitative and qualitative thalassemia erythropoiesis, several trials were undertaken combining rHuEPO with hydroxyurea (HU), which is known to increase % Hb F, MCV and MCH without a major effect on Hb levels. The designed trial included 3 to 6 months of HU alone (20 mg/kg x 4/week), or with rHuEPO alone (500 u/kg x 3/week or 375 u/kg x 2/week) or a combination of the two drugs. The results show an additive effect of the two drugs, in some of the patients. It is not known whether the addition of oral iron to rHuEPO is warranted for maximal erythropoietic response. The major limiting factor in designing large scale clinical trials is the relatively high cost of the drug. Nevertheless rHuEPO alone or in combination with other Hb F modulating drugs may have a positive effect in thalassemia with resulting improvement in the quality of life.

TI  - The impact of scalar variable and process on athlete-control comparisons of cardiac dimensions.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared linear left ventricular dimensions and mass (LVM), before and after normalizing for body dimensions via allometric and ratio-standard scaling. METHODS: Height (HT; m), body mass (BM; kg), body surface area (BSA; m2), and fat-free mass (FFM; kg) were measured in elite male weight lifters (N = 11) and age-matched controls (N = 45). Septum (ST), posterior wall (PWT), and internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd) were measured from M-mode echocardiographic traces and used to calculate LVM. Via multivariate allometric scaling, common group power function exponents were identified for all cardiac dimensions related to all body size scalars. t-tests were used to compare group differences in absolute and scaled data. RESULTS: BM, FFM, and BSA, as well as absolute LVM (262 +/- 54 vs 206 +/- 39) and ST (11 +/- 1 vs 9 +/- 1), were greater in the athletes (P < 0.05). All exponents conformed to dimensionality theory within 95% confidence limits. Fat-free mass presented the highest multiple R value and the least residual sum of squares of any scalar variable. If FFM was used to scale, no difference in LVM remained (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that any group effect on cardiac dimensions is substantially altered by the scaling procedure. The choice of the most appropriate variable and process for partitioning out any effect of body dimensions on cardiac dimensions in similar studies requires attention.

TI  - Soil-transmitted helminthiases in China: a spatial statistical analysis.  
AB  - The prevalence of the soil-transmitted helminthiases is extremely high in some rural areas in China. The endemic foci of these human parasites constitute one of the most neglected public health problems.  A large scale survey on human parasites (1988-1992) was conducted in China. The prevalences of the soil-transmitted helminthiases in the 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities were reported and correlated with ecological factors (Yu et al, 1994; Xu et al, 1995). In this paper, we re-examined and analyzed the reported results with a spatial pattern test statistic, the D statistic. The values of the D statistic indicated that the spatial correlation of the prevalence of the soil-transmitted helminthiases in China was significant. We also found that the spatial correlation of the prevalence could largely be explained by the paddy field area per capita. The correlation of the prevalence of the soil-transmitted helminthiases and the paddy field area per capita was higher than the correlation of the prevalence with the factors found previously by Xu et al (1995).

TI  - A homogeneous, ligase-mediated DNA diagnostic test.  
AB  - Single-nucleotide variations are the most widely distributed genetic markers in the human genome. A subset of these variations, the substitution mutations, are responsible for most genetic disorders. As single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are being developed for molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders and large-scale population studies for genetic analysis of complex traits, a simple, sensitive, and specific test for single nucleotide changes is highly desirable. In this report we describe the development of a homogeneous DNA detection method that requires no further manipulations after the initial reaction is set up. This assay, named dye-labeled oligonucleotide ligation (DOL), combines the PCR and the oligonucleotide ligation reaction in a two-stage thermal cycling sequence with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection monitored in real time. Because FRET occurs only when the donor and acceptor dyes are in close proximity, one can infer the genotype or mutational status of a DNA sample by monitoring the specific ligation of dye-labeled oligonucleotide probes. We have successfully applied the DOL assay to genotype 10 SNPs or mutations. By designing the PCR primers and ligation probes in a consistent manner, multiple assays can be done under the same thermal cycling conditions.

TI  - Studies of validity for the Prison Control Scale.  
AB  - Locus of control seems to be important in the adjustment of prisoners both during incarceration and upon release.  The Prison Control Scale is one of two measures of locus of control specific to prisons. This paper is an account of validity studies conducted on the scale. Assessments included four tests of construct validity and one each of concurrent and known-groups validity. The results support the validity of the scale. Suggestions for further scale assessment and other research are briefly discussed.

TI  - Accurate binaural mirroring of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions suggests influence of time-locking in medial efferents.  
AB  - Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) of nearly identical acoustic frequency in both ears are a common observation, but it is unknown if this binaural mirroring effect is random, artefactual, genetic, developmental, or of other origin. The available raw data of all human SOAE surveys were pooled, and the intervals of all possible binaural emission pairs (N = 9555) were listed according to size on the Cent-scale (1 Cent = 1/100 semitone = 1/1200 octave). Statistical analysis showed (1) a slight broad-band mirroring in the 0-100 Cent range (P < 0.05), and (2) a strong narrow-band mirroring (NBM) in the 0-20 Cent range (P < 0.001). Negative results in a detailed SOAE cluster detection program excluded experimental artefacts as causes of NBM. Analysis of the large subgroup of twin data excluded genetic and intrauterine developmental causes. Systemic developmental causes are unrealistic, as 20 Cent corresponds to only approximately 80 microm on the cochlear map. Analysis of infant data indicated that the effect may be introduced after birth by secondary factors. Interaural crosstalk was examined but had to be rejected. It is suggested that bilaterally spreading period information in the medial olivocochlear system influences outer hair cells of the same best frequency in both ears very similarly. Evidence concerning possible effects on electromotility is discussed, and experimental tests are proposed.

TI  - Abnormal amino acid metabolism in patients with early stage Alzheimer dementia.  
AB  - Plasma levels of several amino acids were studied in 14 patients with early stage probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 17 age-matched controls. In the AD patients a possible relationship between amino acid levels and behavioural symptomatology was also investigated. We found significantly reduced levels of tryptophan and methionine in plasma samples from the AD patients compared to the control subjects. Moreover, plasma tyrosine/large neutral amino acids (LNAA) ratio and the ratio of plasma taurine and the product of the plasma levels of methionine and serine (TSM-ratio) were significantly increased in the AD patients in comparison with the controls. However, no difference was found in plasma tryptophan/LNAA ratio and in homocysteine levels between both groups. Concerning the behavioural symptomatology no significant correlation was found between the Reisberg Behave AD scale and plasma amino acid levels or ratios. The reported findings suggest that abnormal amino acid metabolism is present in the early stages of AD. We hypothesize that this abnormality could play a role in the pathogenesis of behavioural changes occurring in later stages of AD.

TI  - Discrimination between monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia using cycle length variability measured by wavelet transform analysis.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the capability of wavelet transform (WT) analysis to differentiate between monomorphic (MVTs) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (PVTs) in a canine model and to relate these results to epicardial isochronal maps on a beat-by-beat basis. Unipolar electrograms were simultaneously recorded from the surface of both ventricles with a 127-lead sock electrode array in 24 open-chest anesthetized dogs. The sampling frequency was 500 Hz. Atrioventricular block was induced by formaldehyde injection into the atrioventricular node. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 60 minutes under ventricular pacing (140 stimuli/min) followed by reperfusion. Ventricular tachycardias were obtained during reperfusion and during left stellate ganglion stimulation. After visual selection, a total of 97 segments of 2,048 samples (4.096 seconds) were extracted and classified as 67 MVTs and 30 PVTs. A parameter based on the cycle length variability was defined in the second scale of the WT decomposition, normalized by its mean value. Similar assessment of cycle length variability was performed based on the detection of the point of most rapid change in potential with a negative slope in excess of -0.5 mV/ms in each individual electrogram to test the accuracy of the results obtained with the WT parameter. The WT parameter correctly identified 97% MVT and 83.3% PVT segments, for an overall accuracy of 92.8%. Beat-by-beat epicardial maps of MVT displayed a cluster of sites of initial activation close to the reperfusion area, while the sites of breakthrough from beats during PVT were much more dispersed over both ventricles. A strong and significant correlation was found between the number of electrodes with the earliest epicardial activation and the WT parameter (r = .78, P < .0001). To test the accuracy of the results obtained, a comparison was performed between the WT parameter (0.082 +/- 0.007) and the cycle length variability, estimated as the normalized standard deviation of the intervals between individual electrograms (0.076 +/- 0.006). No significant differences were shown (P = .0022), and a strong linear correlation was found between both measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient, .966). It is concluded that WT analysis discriminated accurately between MVT and PVT, and a quantitative relation was found with the spatial dispersion of sites of earliest epicardial activation. The WT results strongly correlated with those obtained by another method of estimating cycle length variability. Methodologically, the strength of the WT lies in the complementary information that could be extracted from the processing of electrograms to enhance the detection/discrimination of different types of arrhythmias.

TI  - Postexcitatory inhibition after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in patients with drug-induced parkinsonism and in healthy individuals.  
AB  - The duration of the postexcitatory inhibition after transcranial magnetic stimulation was investigated in 16 patients with drug-induced parkinsonism and in 20 healthy control individuals. In the patients, the chlorpromazine-equivalent of the neuroleptic medication was determined, and the severity of the drug-induced parkinsonism was measured using the Simpson-Angus Scale score. Group comparison (U-test) revealed a significant shorter postexcitatory inhibition in patients than in control individuals. Regression analyses showed a negative correlation between the Simpson-Angus scale score and the duration of the postexcitatory inhibition. The correlation only reached significance for a group of patients who received at least one butyrophenone derivate. No clear-cut relation was found between the chlorpromazine equivalent and the postexcitatory inhibition. These results indicate that drug-induced parkinsonism shares features of genuine Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, it seems possible to assess the extrapyramidal side effect of butyrophenone derivates, but not for other neuroleptic drugs, by means of the method described.

TI  - NTP concentration effects on initial transcription by T7 RNAP indicate that translocation occurs through passive sliding and reveal that divergent promoters have distinct NTP concentration requirements for productive initiation.  
AB  - The hypothesis that active site translocation during initial transcription occurs by a passive sliding mechanism which allows the pre- and post-translocated states to equilibrate on the time scale of bond formation was tested by evaluating the effects of NTP concentration on individual transcript extension steps in the presence of translocation roadblocks created by proteins bound immediately downstream of a T7 promoter, as well as by evaluating the effects of NTP concentration on competing transcript extension pathways (iterative synthesis and "normal" extension). Results are consistent with a passive sliding mechanism for translocation which is driven by NTP binding, and are inconsistent with mechanisms in which the pre- and post-translocated states fail to equilibrate with each other on the time scale of bond formation or in which translocation is driven by NTP hydrolysis. We also find, in agreement with many previous studies, that divergence from consensus in the ITS (initially transcribed sequence) of the T7 promoter decreases productive initiation. However, this appears to be largely due to increases in the NTP concentration requirements for efficient transcription on the divergent ITSs. Copyright 1998 Academic Press

TI  - ABILHAND: a Rasch-built measure of manual ability.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply the Rasch measurement model to the development of a clinical tool for measuring manual (dis)ability (ABILHAND). DESIGN: Manual ability was evaluated in terms of the difficulty perceived by a hand-impaired patient on 57 representative unimanual or bimanual activities. SETTING: A clinical laboratory. PATIENTS: Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients (14 women, 4 men) were interviewed after wrist arthrodesis (10 right, 4 left, and 4 both wrists). Their ages ranged from 38 to 77 years, time since diagnosis ranged from 7 to 41 years, and time since surgery ranged from 0.5 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ABILHAND, administered at a mean duration of 7 years after arthrodesis. RESULTS: Forty-six of the 57 items define a common, single manual ability continuum with widespread measurement range and regular item distribution. Items relating to feeding, grooming, and dressing upper body worked consistently with their counterparts in other disability scales. More difficult items extend the measurement range beyond that of most existing manual ability scales. CONCLUSION: Even in a small sample of patients, using the Rasch methodology enabled the investigators to produce a useful scale of manual (dis)ability and to define manual ability as a unique construct, at least in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

TI  - Cloning and deletion mutagenesis of the alpha2 delta calcium channel subunit from porcine cerebral cortex. Expression of a soluble form of the protein that retains [3H]gabapentin binding activity.  
AB  - The anti-epileptic, anti-hyperalgesic, and anxiolytic agent gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane acetic acid or Neurontin) has previously been shown to bind with high affinity to the alpha2delta subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (Gee, N. S. , Brown, J. P., Dissanayake, V. U. K., Offord, J., Thurlow, R., and Woodruff, G.N. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5768-5776). We report here the cloning, sequencing, and deletion mutagenesis of the alpha2delta subunit from porcine brain. The deduced protein sequence has a 95.9 and 98.2% identity to the rat and human neuronal alpha2 delta sequences, respectively. [3H]Gabapentin binds with a KD of 37.5 +/- 10.4 nM to membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type porcine alpha2 delta cDNA. Six deletion mutants (B-G) that lack the delta polypeptide, together with varying amounts of the alpha2 component, failed to bind [3H]gabapentin. C-terminal deletion mutagenesis of the delta polypeptide identified a segment (residues 960-994) required for correct assembly of the [3H]gabapentin binding pocket. Mutant L, which lacks the putative membrane anchor in the delta sequence, was found in both membrane-associated and soluble secreted forms. The soluble form was not proteolytically cleaved into separate alpha2 and delta chains but still retained a high affinity (KD = 30.7 +/- 8.1 nM) for [3H]gabapentin. The production of a soluble alpha2delta mutant supports the single transmembrane model of the alpha2 delta subunit and is an important step toward the large-scale recombinant expression of the protein.

TI  - Social inequality in coronary heart disease: a comparison of occupational classifications.  
AB  - The British Registrar General's Social Classification has been strongly criticised for its lack of explanatory value. Furthermore, studies of social inequality in coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes have often found associations between measures of inequality and heart disease unaccounted by conventional CHD risk factors. Alternative occupational classifications such as the Erikson-Goldthorpe schema and the Cambridge scale could be used to explore potential causal narratives which explain such residual associations. Results from a longitudinal study of adults in Britain show that the Cambridge scale has the strongest association with CHD and part of its strength is due to its strong association with CHD related health behaviours. Women classified by their partner's occupation had stronger associations with CHD compared to classifications by their own occupation. Job strain may not account for the observed social inequalities in CHD.  The Cambridge scale shows stronger patterns of linear association with CHD than the RGSC and should be included in other studies of social inequality in health in the U.K.

TI  - Quantitative ELISA-polymerase chain reaction at saturation using homologous internal DNA standards and chemiluminescence revelation.  
AB  - In this report, we describe the development and validation of a convenient, versatile and high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This assay is based on the use of only one concentration of an internal homologous standard (IS) easily obtained by replacing an 18 nt specific sequence using recombinant PCR. Target and IS amplicons are quantitated at the PCR plateau phase using ELISA which includes a hybridization step with either target or IS specific probes and luminometric revelation. Luminometry allows measurement of amplicon levels without the need for serial dilutions. Experimental values were obtained by comparing their target/IS signal ratios to those of an external scale. A linear dynamic range over four orders of magnitude and good reproducibility were obtained. We used this assay to investigate variations of IL-13 mRNA expression in HIV-infected patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, we also report a variant of this method using Taqman assay in the ABI PRISM 7,700 apparatus.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory findings in referrals for mitochondrial DNA analysis [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly, mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are being considered when investigating the aetiology of neurological diseases in childhood. However, they are often difficult to predict clinically. METHOD: Mitochondrial DNA analysis was carried out on 190 children from 1992 to 1996. Most patients were screened for large scale rearrangements and point mutations at nucleotide positions 3243, 3271, 8344, and 8993. RESULTS: Mutations were found in only 15 patients (7.9%) and were either large scale rearrangements (seven patients) or point mutations at nucleotide position 3243 (eight patients). Other point mutations were screened for depending on the clinical picture. The age of symptom onset was significantly older in children with an mtDNA mutation (mean 7.0 years) compared with children without a mutation (mean 2.8 years). Neither Leigh's syndrome (28 cases) nor severe infantile lactic acidosis (12 cases) was associated with mtDNA mutation. Only three clinical features were significantly associated with an mtDNA mutation: progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, and pigmentary retinopathy. Family history was valuable: the point mutation at nucleotide 3243 (but not the large scale rearrangements) was associated with maternal inheritance; and consanguinity was not associated with mtDNA mutations. The only investigation that provided specific evidence of an underlying mtDNA mutation was histochemical staining of muscle biopsy specimens. The large scale mutations associated with Kearns-Sayre syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia were found in DNA from muscle only, not leucocyte DNA; whereas point mutations were found in leucocyte DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Even among children seen at a neurogenetic referral centre, mtDNA mutations were very uncommon. Muscle biopsy was the only investigation to provide evidence of mtDNA abnormality.

TI  - Micropatterned surfaces for control of cell shape, position, and function.  
AB  - The control of cell position and function is a fundamental focus in the development of applications ranging from cellular biosensors to tissue engineering. Using microcontact printing of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates on gold, we manufactured substrates that contained micrometer-scale islands of extracellular matrix (ECM) separated by nonadhesive regions such that the pattern of islands determined the distribution and position of bovine and human endothelial cells. In addition, the size and geometry of the islands were shown to control cell shape. Traditional approaches to modulate cell shape, either by attaching suspended cells to microbeads of different sizes or by plating cells on substrates coated with different densities of ECM, suggested that cell shape may play an important role in control of apoptosis as well as growth. Data are presented which show how micropatterned substrates were used to definitively test this hypothesis. Progressively restricting bovine and human endothelial cell extension by culturing cells on smaller and smaller micropatterned adhesive islands regulated a transition from growth to apoptosis on a single continuum of cell spreading, thus confirming the central role of cell shape in cell function. The micropatterning technology is therefore essential not only for construction of biosurface devices but also for the investigation of the fundamental biology of cell-ECM interactions.

TI  - The measurement of psychological maltreatment: early data on the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale.  
AB  - This paper describes a self-report measure, the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale, which yields a quantitative index of the frequency and extent of various types of negative experiences in childhood and adolescence. Data on this measure are presented for two large samples of college students and for a small clinical sample of subjects with a diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder. The strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scale in the college population is documented, and its validity is attested to by demonstrating that it correlates significantly with outcomes such as dissociation, depression, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and victimization, all of which have previously been associated with childhood trauma or abuse. The extremely high scores of the Multiple Personality subjects confer additional validity to the measure. The authors suggest that the construct of psychological maltreatment underlies the destructive elements of numerous forms of abuse and neglect, and that the scale they have developed may provide a useful index of this construct.

TI  - Relationships between dental hygienists' career attitudes and their retention of practice. Part II. From the results of the Ohio Dentist and Dental Hygiene Surveys.  
AB  - This article utilizes findings from the Ohio Dental Hygiene Survey and Ohio Dentist Survey to uncover what specific dental hygiene attitudes exist relative to employment and what factors have led to job termination and to re-entry. Ohio dental hygiene employees are most satisfied with patient relationships, co-worker relationships, and flexible working hours. The dental hygienists are least satisfied with fringe benefits, financial growth, and career creativity. Salary, benefits, nor career longevity were significant factors in determining satisfaction. Dental hygienists who were not working when surveyed, said they would consider returning to practice if a better salary were available, if they could find part-time work, if there were a good wage scale with benefits, or if their own financial need changed. Thirty-six percent of the non-practitioners said they would not ever consider returning to practice due to working conditions, establishment of a new career, or inadequate compensation. Dentist employers stated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their dental hygienists' patient care and contribution to the practice.
