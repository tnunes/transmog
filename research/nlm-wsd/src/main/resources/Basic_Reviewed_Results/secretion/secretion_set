TI  - Nonenzymatic glycation of type I collagen modifies interaction with UMR 201-10B preosteoblastic cells.  
AB  - Advanced glycation endproduct (AGE), whose formation is accelerated on long lived extracellular matrix proteins in diabetes, is implicated in diabetic complications in various tissues. Type I collagen is the predominant matrix protein of bone and plays an important role in bone cell-matrix interactions. We have previously reported the accelerated accumulation of AGE collagen in bone tissue in diabetes mellitus (DM), in which reduced bone mineral density was observed. In addition, when cultures of mature primary rat osteoblasts were plated onto an in vitro AGE-modified collagen substrate, they showed altered cell functions, in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin secretion, and nodule formation (J Bone Miner Res 11:931-937; 1996). To determine whether AGE collagen might also affect differentiation of preosteoblasts, we compared the effects of plating the preosteoblastic UMR 201-10B cell line onto AGE-modified collagen with plating onto unmodified collagen. The latter had been shown previously to promote differentiation of UMR 201 cells. We have also explored whether these effects might be partly mediated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor. Growth of UMR 201-10B cells on a type I collagen substrate significantly inhibited cell growth and retinoic acid (RA)-induced upregulation of ALP activity, compared to cells on plastic. These inhibitory effects were reduced by prior glycation of collagen, in a dose-dependent manner with respect to AGE content. Unmodified collagen stimulated production of osteopontin mRNA, which was reduced by AGE modification to levels attained in cells on plastic. Growth on control collagen inhibited TGF-beta type II receptor binding in 10B cells, while this inhibition was reduced by AGE modification. These data suggest that glycation of collagen interferes with specific interaction(s) between UMR 201-10B cells and collagen. Based on our previous results in UMR 201 cells, these results would be compatible with the notion that glycated collagen has reduced ability to promote differentiation of preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts. These data further suggest that collagen-mediated events in these cells may be at least in part mediated by regulation of the TGF-beta receptor expression.

TI  - CD40 expression by gingival fibroblasts: correlation of phenotype with function.  
AB  - CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor family, is constitutively expressed by cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin, including fibroblasts. Signaling through this receptor molecule regulates inflammatory cytokine secretion by many cell types. Based on the recently described cytokine secretory heterogeneity of fibroblast cell subsets, we hypothesized that secretion of inflammatory cytokines by gingival fibroblast cultures may be dictated by the existence of differential proportions of cytokine-secreting subpopulations which express high levels of CD40. After examining a large number of gingival fibroblast (GF) cultures we find that the frequency of IL-6- and IL-8-secreting cells mirrors the frequency of cells expressing high levels of CD40 in these cultures. In addition, we demonstrate a direct functional relationship between CD40 expression and IL-6 or IL-8 secretion by showing that ligation of this molecule on GF, and CD40+ fibroblast subsets in particular, up-regulates secretion of these cytokines in vitro.

TI  - Macrophages promote prosclerotic responses in cultured rat mesangial cells: a mechanism for the initiation of glomerulosclerosis.  
AB  - Glomerulosclerosis is the final outcome of a number of different causes of glomerular injury, during which the structures of the glomerulus are obliterated by extracellular matrix. Accumulating evidence suggests that infiltrating macrophages play a pivotal role in the progression to glomerulosclerosis. The present study defines the role played by macrophages at both cellular and molecular levels in the initiation of the sclerotic process in cultured rat mesangial cells. Macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM) generated from thioglycollate-elicited, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages upregulated mesangial cell fibronectin production in a dose- and time-dependent manner, independently of cell proliferation. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled 35S-fibronectin confirmed that the matrix protein was synthesized de novo. The genes for fibronectin and the matrix proteins laminin and collagen IV were also found to be upregulated 2.86 +/- 0.24-, 4.94 +/- 0.17-, and 3.03 +/- 0.31-fold over controls, respectively (P < 0.001). Macrophage modulation of matrix turnover was suggested by an upregulation of both transin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene transcription. Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, or interleukin (IL)-1beta could not be detected in the MPCM per se; however, TGFbeta1 and platelet-derived growth factor AB were found to be secreted into mesangial cell culture supernatants.  Secretion was augmented 1.69 +/- 0.16- and 2.28 +/- 0.28-fold, respectively (both P < 0.001), in response to MPCM. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that protein secretion had been preceded by upregulation of the genes for these cytokines (2.2 +/- 0.4-fold [P < 0.001] and 5.7 +/- 1.2-fold [P < 0.004], respectively). Incubation of MPCM with either neutralizing antibody or the growth factor receptor antagonist suramin demonstrated that TGFbeta1 played a significant, although minor, role in MPCM-stimulated fibronectin production. In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence for a direct role of macrophages in the progression to glomerulosclerosis.

TI  - High-level expression of recombinant Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase in offhia pastoris by fermentation.  
AB  - Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a Ca2+ mobilizing cyclic nucleotide derived from NAD+, is rapidly emerging as an endogenous modulator of Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release mechanisms in various cellular systems. ADP ribosyl cyclase, first isolated from the marine invertebrate Aplysia californica, cyclizes NAD+ to cADPR. In this study we have utilized the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to express high levels of this enzyme. The cyclase construct consisted of the soluble domain, with isoleucine (25 residues following the initial methionine) as the N-terminus, cloned in frame with the yeast alpha-factor mating signal sequence. Cyclase yeast transformants were screened using the Zeocin (phleomycin from Streptomyces verticillus) selectable marker which resulted in 100% active transformation. All active clones comprised the methanol utilization slow (Muts) phenotype. The protein was expressed using the tightly regulated methanol-inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor mating secretion signal. Using high biomass fermentations, up to 300 mg/liter of cyclase was achieved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the heterologous protein comprised nearly 90-95% of the total protein secreted extracellularly. The enzyme characteristics of the recombinant cyclase compared favorably with those of the native enzyme. The yeast expression system can thus produce gram quantities of this novel protein.

TI  - A practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of acute sinusitis [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute sinusitis. OPTIONS: Diagnostic clinical criteria and imaging techniques, the role of antimicrobial therapy and duration of treatment, and the role of adjunct therapy, including decongestants, glucocorticosteroids and nasal irrigation. OUTCOMES: Improved accuracy of clinical diagnosis, better utilization of imaging techniques and rational use of antimicrobial therapy. EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search for relevant articles published from 1980 to 1996 using the MeSH terms "sinusitis," "acute sinusitis," "respiratory infections," "upper respiratory infections," "sinusitis" and "diagnosis," "sinusitis" and "therapy," "sinusitis" and "etiology," and "antimicrobial resistance" and search for additional articles from the reference lists of retrieved articles. Papers referring to chronic sinusitis, sinusitis in compromised patients and documented nonbacterial sinusitis were excluded. The evidence was evaluated by participants at the Canadian Sinusitis Symposium, field in Toronto on April 26-27, 1996. VALUES: A hierarchical evaluation of the strength of evidence modified from the methods of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination was used. Strategies were identified to deal with problems for which no adequate clinical data were available. Recommendations arrived at by consensus of the symposium participants were included. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Increased awareness of acute sinusitis, accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment should reduce costs related to unnecessary investigations, time lost from work and complications due to inappropriate treatment. As well, physicians will be better able to decide which patients will not require antimicrobial therapy, thus saving the patient the cost and potential side effects of treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinical diagnosis can usually be made from the patient's history and findings on physical examination only. Five clinical findings comprising 3 symptoms (maxillary toothache, poor response to decongestants and a history of coloured nasal discharge) and 2 signs (purulent nasal secretion and abnormal transillumination result) are the best predictors of acute bacterial sinusitis (level I evidence). Transillumination is a useful technique in the hands of experienced personnel, but only negative findings are useful (level III evidence). Radiography is not warranted when the likelihood of acute sinusitis is high or low but is useful when the diagnosis is in doubt (level III evidence). First-line therapy should be a 10-day course of amoxicillin (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be given to patients allergic to penicillin) (level I evidence) and a decongestant (level III evidence). Patients allergic to amoxicillin and those not responding to first-line therapy should be switched to a second-line agent. As well, patients with recurrent episodes of acute sinusitis who have been assessed and found not to have anatomic anomalies may also benefit from second-line therapy (level III evidence). VALIDATION: The recommendations are based on consensus of Canadian and American experts in infectious diseases, microbiology, otolaryngology and family medicine. The guidelines were reviewed independently for the advisory committee by 2 external experts. Previous guidelines did not exist in Canada.

TI  - Elevated calcium and activation of trypsinogen in rat pancreatic acini.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis associated with hypercalcaemia has been described in humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that calcium dose dependently accelerates trypsinogen activation, and it is generally believed that ectopic activation of digestive enzymes is an early event in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. AIMS AND METHODS: Trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) was measured in isolated rat pancreatic acini exposed to elevated extracellular calcium in order to investigate the association between calcium and trypsinogen activation in living cells. TAP was determined in the culture medium either before (extracellular compartment) or after (intracellular compartment) cell homogenisation. RESULTS: Neither secretory stimulation nor elevated calcium alone caused an increase in TAP levels. Maximal cerulein or carbachol stimulation superimposed on high medium calcium, however, significantly increased intracellular trypsinogen activation twofold. This increase was inhibited by either NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or verapamil. Acinar cell morphology and function remained intact as demonstrated by electron microscopy and secretagogue dose-response studies. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that increased intracellular trypsinogen activation is an early step in the pathogenesis of hypercalcaemia induced pancreatitis. The model may have a bearing on other types of pancreatitis as elevated cytosolic calcium is thought to be an early event in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in general.

TI  - N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein contains high and low affinity ATP-binding sites that are functionally distinct.  
AB  - N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) has been shown to be involved in numerous intracellular membrane fusion events of both the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways. Sequence analysis indicates that the NSF subunit contains two nucleotide-binding sites, both with the classical Walker A and B motifs. In this report, we examine the nucleotide binding properties of NSF. The homotrimer contains three high affinity ATP-binding sites with Kd = 30-40 nM for ATP and Kd = 2 microM for ADP. This class of binding sites did not bind AMP, adenine, or GTP. A second class of lower affinity nucleotide binding sites with a Kd = 15-20 microM was also detected. Using various mutant forms of NSF, the high affinity nucleotide-binding sites were localized to the D2 domains and the low affinity sites were localized to the D1 domains. Functionally it is these lower affinity sites in D1 that are crucial for NSF activity. Nucleotide concentration greatly affected the ability of NSF to interact with alpha-SNAP.SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein-SNAP receptor) complex, suggesting that only when the D1 domain ATP-binding sites are occupied does NSF bind to the alpha-SNAP.SNARE complex.

TI  - A physiological level of rhubarb fiber increases proglucagon gene expression and modulates intestinal glucose uptake in rats.  
AB  - Previous work demonstrated that a high fiber diet upregulates proglucagon mRNA and secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1(7-37)] and insulin compared with an elemental fiber-free diet. This study examined whether similar intakes of fibers differing in physiochemical and fermentative properties alter the expression of intestinal hormones and intestinal absorptive properties. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a 50 g/kg cellulose or rhubarb fiber diet for 14 d. Ileal proglucagon mRNA levels were significantly higher in rats fed rhubarb fiber than in those fed cellulose fiber (9.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.0 densitometer units). Proglucagon mRNA in the colon did not differ between diet treatments. Plasma c-peptide concentrations were significantly higher 30 min after an oral glucose tolerance test in the rhubarb vs. cellulose group (1627 +/- 67 vs. 1290 +/- 71 pmol/L). Passive permeability, measured by the uptake of L-glucose, was significantly higher in the jejunum of rats fed cellulose compared with those fed rhubarb fiber. Adjusting total glucose uptake for passive permeability and unstirred water layer resistance resulted in a higher Km being calculated for the jejunum and ileum of the cellulose fiber group. Jejunal and ileal carrier-mediated uptakes (Vmax) were not altered by diet and reflected the lack of difference between groups in sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) and sodium-independent glucose transporter (GLUT2) mRNA levels. Replacing cellulose fiber with rhubarb fiber in a diet upregulated ileal proglucagon mRNA and resulted in a reduced passive permeability but did not affect glucose transport of the small intestine. This work establishes the importance of dietary fiber fermentability in modulating intestinal proglucagon expression and possibly glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Gamma-heregulin: a novel heregulin isoform that is an autocrine growth factor for the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-175.  
AB  - A novel neuregulin isoform, termed gamma-HRG, was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-175. As observed with other neuregulins, gamma-HRG, is a product of alternative mRNA splicing of the neuregulin gene. Gamma-HRG contains the EGF-like and immunoglobulin-like domains that are commonly found in other family members, but lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. The new isoform possesses a unique N-terminal region that includes a hydrophobic domain that may function as a secretion signal. A purified recombinant version of gamma-HRG competes for binding to soluble ErbB3- and ErbB4-IgG fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for rHRGbeta1(177-244). Gamma-HRG has a wide distribution in mesenchymal or neuronal tissues but in contrast to other neuregulins, it is not present in breast, lung, liver and small intestine. Expression of gamma-HRG with its cognate receptors, ErbB3 and ErbB2 suggested that the growth of the MDA-MB-175 cell line might be a result of the autocrine stimulation of a growth factor signaling pathway. Treatment of MDA-MB-175 cells with an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody that interferes with the ligand-dependent formation of ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer complexes shows a strong growth inhibitory effect on this cell line. Moreover, incubation with a receptor-IgG fusion protein that neutralizes secreted gamma-HRG, also inhibits cell growth. These data suggest that the secretion of gamma-HRG by MDA-MB-175 cells leads to the formation of a constitutively active receptor complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an autocrine manner.

TI  - Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule interfere with TCR/CD3-mediated ras activation leading to T cell anergy/apoptosis.  
AB  - It has been previously demonstrated that the occupancy of CD4 molecules by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 results in marked inhibition of T cell receptor-CD3 complex (TCR/CD3) activation-induced IL-2 secretion. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibitory effects of gp160 on T cell signaling, we have investigated the intracellular biochemical events and biological output in response to anti-CD3 mAb activation of purified peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from healthy donors with and without prior exposure to HIV-1 gp160. Pretreatment with gp160 resulted in marked inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of p59(fyn), PLC-gamma1, ras activation, and TNF-alpha secretion in anti-CD3 mAb activated CD4+ T cells, and a subset of CD4+ cells underwent activation-induced cell death. The data presented here provide insight into the mechanism by which the interaction of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins with CD4 molecules may alter TCR/CD3-activation-induced signal transduction resulting in anergy and apoptosis with consequent functional deficiency of CD4+ T cells.

TI  - Identification of genes controlling growth polarity in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a possible role of N-glycosylation and involvement of the exocyst complex.  
AB  - The regulation of secretion polarity and cell surface growth during the cell cycle is critical for proper morphogenesis and viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A shift from isotropic cell surface growth to polarized growth is necessary for bud emergence and a repolarization of secretion to the bud neck is necessary for cell separation. Although alterations in the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in these changes in secretion polarity, clearly other cellular systems involved in secretion are likely to be targets of cell cycle regulation. To investigate mechanisms coupling cell cycle progression to changes in secretion polarity in parallel with and downstream of regulation of actin polarization, we implemented a screen for mutants defective specifically in polarized growth but with normal actin cytoskeleton structure. These mutants fell into three classes: those partially defective in N-glycosylation, those linked to specific defects in the exocyst, and a third class neither defective in glycosylation nor linked to the exocyst. These results raise the possibility that changes in N-linked glycosylation may be involved in a signal linking cell cycle progression and secretion polarity and that the exocyst may have regulatory functions in coupling the secretory machinery to the polarized actin cytoskeleton.

TI  - Reconstitution of high affinity IgE receptor-mediated secretion by transfecting protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK.  
AB  - To study the role of the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) in receptor-mediated secretion, we transfected FAK cDNA into a variant (3B6) of the RBL-2H3 mast cell line. This 3B6 cell line expressed low levels of FAK and was defective in high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) but not Ca2+ ionophore-mediated secretion. FcepsilonRI-mediated secretion was reconstituted after transfection of wild-type FAK. Histamine release was also enhanced by the stable expression of two mutants of FAK: a kinase-inactive form in which the ATP binding site Lys-454 was replaced by Arg or a mutant in which the autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 was replaced by Phe. Therefore, the catalytic activity and the autophosphorylation site of FAK are not essential for secretion. FcepsilonRI aggregation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both mutants of FAK to the same extent as wild-type FAK. Therefore, tyrosine kinases activated by FcepsilonRI aggregation are phosphorylating FAK and some of these phosphorylation sites are other than Tyr-397. These results strongly suggest that FAK plays a role in FcepsilonRI-induced secretion by functioning as an adapter or linker molecule.

TI  - Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype-selective analogues differentially suppress in vitro growth hormone and prolactin in human pituitary adenomas. Novel potential therapy for functional pituitary tumors.  
AB  - Previously, we have shown somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtype-specific regulation of growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin (PRL) secretion in human fetal pituitary cultures, where GH and thyroid-stimulating hormone are mediated by both SSTR2 and SSTR5, whereas SSTR2 preferentially mediates PRL secretion. We now tested SSTR subtype-selective analogues in primary human GH- and PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma cultures. Analogue affinities determined by membrane radioligand binding in cells stably expressing human SSTR forms were either SSTR2 or SSTR5-selective. Analogues preferential either for SSTR2, including octreotide, lanreotide, and novel compounds with improved affinity for SSTR2, or new SSTR5-selective compounds suppressed GH in tumor cell cultures (up to 44% of control; P < 0.0005). However, novel analogues from both groups were 30-40% more potent than octreotide and lanreotide in suppressing GH (P < 0.05). Heterologous analogue combinations containing both SSTR2- and SSTR5-selective compounds were more potent in decreasing GH than analogues used alone (P < 0.05), or than combinations of compounds specific for the same receptor subtype (P < 0.005). In contrast, SSTR2-selective analogues did not suppress PRL release from six cultured prolactinomas studied. However, new SSTR5-selective analogues suppressed in vitro PRL secretion (30-40%; P < 0.05) in four of six prolactinomas. These results suggest that both SSTR2 and SSTR5 are involved in GH regulation in somatotroph adenoma cells, whereas SSTR5 exclusively regulates PRL secretion from prolactinoma cells. Thus, somatostatin analogues with improved selective binding affinity for these receptor subtypes may be effective in the treatment of either GH- or PRL-secreting adenomas.

TI  - Immunolocalization of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase and cytochrome P450 aromatase in the equine corpus luteum of dioestrus and early pregnancy.  
AB  - The onset of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) secretion in pregnant mares is associated with an increase in luteal androgen and oestrogen production. The luteal cell type(s) responsible for the increased production of androgens and oestrogens has not been identified in the equine corpus luteum. In this study, we examined the pattern of expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450(17 alpha)) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) by immunohistochemistry in equine luteal tissue collected during dioestrus (days 7-10; n = 4) and early pregnancy, before (days 29-35; n = 4) and after (days 39-45; n = 4) the onset of endogenous eCG secretion. All luteal cells expressed 3 beta-HSD, P450(17 alpha) and P450arom. The distribution of 3 beta-HSD, P450(17 alpha) and P450arom did not differ with stage of the reproductive cycle. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining for 3 beta-HSD did not appear to differ with reproductive stage. In contrast, the intensity of immunostaining for P450(17 alpha) increased after the onset of eCG secretion. The intensity of immunostaining for P450arom increased during pregnancy before the onset of eCG secretion and diminished after the onset of eCG secretion to the intensity seen in dioestrous corpora lutea. This finding suggests that androgen and oestrogen production is not compartmentalized within the equine corpus luteum. Both large and small luteal cells express the steroidogenic enzymes necessary for oestrogen production, and the intensity of immunostaining for P450(17 alpha) and P450arom appears to be stage-specific.

TI  - Helix-loop-helix motif in GnRH associated peptide is critical for negative regulation of prolactin secretion.  
AB  - The GnRH associated prolactin inhibiting factor (GAP) reveals the signature sequence associated with the helix-loop-helix structural motif. A number of different peptide fragments of GAP were designed, synthesized and analysed by circular dichroism and by an in vivo assay for prolactin secretion inhibiting activity. Peptides corresponding to the two individual alpha-helices and a 44-residue peptide comprising the entire helix-loop-helix motif show significant helical propensity in circular dichroism spectra. However, a peptide corresponding to the loop sequence shows no helical propensity. Albeit, the peptide corresponding to helix-loop-helix motif was found to inhibit prolactin secretion and augment circulating levels of gonadotropins in the in vivo assay; other shorter peptides did not show such activity. The activity profile of the 44-residue peptide was biphasic and very similar to that of the recombinant GAP. Thus, the prolactin inhibiting activity of this factor is defined by its helix-loop-helix motif as in the case of the transcription factors of developmental genes. The structural features of a homology-based model of GAP in complex with E47, a ubiquitous HLH-type developmental gene regulator, are consistent with the structural requirements of the negative regulation of transcription by helix-loop-helix proteins.

TI  - Leptin inhibits in vitro hypothalamic somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mRNA levels.  
AB  - Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a recently discovered hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates food intake and energy expenditure. The site of action of leptin is likely to be the hypothalamus, since this area is important in the control of food intake and leptin receptor mRNA is particularly abundant in this area. In order to further unravel the mechanisms by which leptin acts, we have studied the effect of leptin on in vitro somatostatin synthesis and secretion. Leptin administration to fetal rat neurones in monolayer culture led to a time dependent decrease in basal somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mRNA levels, the maximal effect being observed with 6x10(-8) M leptin after 24 h incubation. Furthermore, leptin completely blunted 10(-7) M Neuropeptide Y-induced increase in somatostatin secretion and somatostatin mRNA levels as well as 10(-3) M (Bu)2-cAMP and 10(-6) M A23187-induced somatostatin secretion. Finally, leptin (3x10(-8) M M) also inhibited low glucose (1.1 mM) induced-somatostatin secretion in perifused adult hypothalami. This data indicates that leptin can influence the neuroendocrine system by regulating hypothalamic somatostatin gene expression.

TI  - Interleukin-12- and interleukin-2-stimulated release of interferon-gamma by uterine CD56++ large granular lymphocytes is amplified by decidual macrophages.  
AB  - Numerous studies have suggested that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) exhibits an inhibitory effect on conceptus development during pregnancy, and recent investigations have shown that decidual CD56++, CD16- large granular lymphocytes (LGL) contain mRNA for IFN-gamma. We have investigated the influence of exogenous interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) on IFN-gamma secretion by cultivated LGL and macrophages isolated from first trimester human decidua. The effect of decidual macrophages on IFN-gamma secretion by LGL was also assessed using co-incubation experiments. Neither IL-12 nor IL-2 stimulated the secretion of IFN-gamma by decidual macrophages. IL-12 alone, but not IL-2 alone, stimulated the release of IFN-gamma by LGL. However, IL-2 acted synergistically with IL-12 to enhance the release of IFN-gamma by LGL. Unstimulated and IL-12- and IL-2-stimulated LGL incubated with macrophages exhibited a marked increase in secretion of IFN-gamma compared to those in monoculture. This effect was also seen when the LGL and macrophages were separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The results suggest that interactions between decidual LGL and macrophages, possibly mediated by soluble factors, could play a role in regulating IFN-gamma secretion at the materno-fetal interface and thus contribute to the control of invasion by the trophoblast.

TI  - Effects of antimitotic agents on secretion and detergent extractibility of adrenal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  
AB  - 1. Evidence exists that associations of adrenal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with the cytoskeleton play an important role in signal transduction pathways by maintaining these receptors in a functional state. These studies were designed to explore this possibility and elucidate the mechanism by which antimitotic agents inhibit activation of adrenal nAChRs. 2. Functional studies demonstrated that vincristine, tubulozole, podophyllotoxin, and demecolcine inhibited nAChR-stimulated catecholamine release noncompetitively and in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 3 (1-10), 5 (2-10), 8 (4-15), and 19 (9-39) microM, respectively. 3. Detergent extraction experiments indicated that approximately 36% of adrenal nAChRs were associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. When chromaffin cells were first treated with antimitotic agents and then detergent solubilized, a significant reduction occurred in the population of adrenal nAChRs associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton. 4. These studies support an association of adrenal nAChRs with microtubules and suggest that the mechanism by which the antimitotic drugs interfere with the signal transduction pathway is by inducing dissociation of nAChRs from the microtubular network.

TI  - Neurotrophin release by neurotrophins: implications for activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.  
AB  - Neurotrophins, secreted in an activity-dependent manner, are thought to be involved in the activity-dependent refinement of synaptic connections. Here we demonstrate that in hippocampal neurons and the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 application of exogenous neurotrophins induces secretion of neurotrophins, an effect that is mediated by the activation of tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (Trks).  Like activity-dependent secretion of neurotrophins, neurotrophin-induced neurotrophin secretion requires mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. Because neurotrophins are likely to be released from both dendrites and axons, neurotrophin-induced neurotrophin release represents a potential positive feedback mechanism, contributing to the reinforcement and stabilization of synaptic connections.

TI  - Lack of linkage between the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene and bipolar affective disorder.  
AB  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a key role in the regulation of the stress response. Abnormalities in CRH secretion have been documented in both the depression and manic phases of bipolar disorder (BPD). In the present study, we investigated genetic linkage between the CRH gene and BPD in 22 pedigrees. A highly informative, short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism adjacent to the CRH gene on human chromosomal region 8q13 was used to examine linkage. Affected sibling pair (ASP) and the likelihood-based disequilibrium tests revealed nonsignificant values. We conclude that the CRH gene is not linked to BPD; if genes involved in the regulation of stress response are indeed linked to BPD, the search should be directed towards those that regulate CRH secretion or its effects on target tissues.

TI  - Decreased nocturnal secretion of melatonin in drug-free schizophrenics: no change after subchronic treatment with antipsychotics.  
AB  - To evaluate the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland in schizophrenia, the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin was investigated in 9 drug-free chronic schizophrenics and in matched healthy subjects. In 7 of the patients, the 24-hour secretory pattern of the pineal hormone was reassessed after 10 weeks of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. In drug-free schizophrenics, the nocturnal increase in plasma melatonin levels was significantly blunted as compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.0001). Chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs significantly improved psychotic symptomatology, but did not change the secretory pattern of melatonin. These data show that the biosynthetic activity of the pineal gland is impaired in chronic schizophrenia and that successful treatment with antipsychotic drugs does not go parallel with changes in the production of melatonin.

TI  - Multi-responsiveness of single anterior pituitary cells to hypothalamic-releasing hormones: a cellular basis for paradoxical secretion.  
AB  - The classic view for hypothalamic regulation of anterior pituitary (AP) hormone secretion holds that release of each AP hormone is controlled specifically by a corresponding hypothalamic-releasing hormone (HRH). In this scenario, binding of a given HRH (thyrotropin-, growth hormone-, corticotropin-, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones) to specific receptors in its target cell increases the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), thereby selectively stimulating the release of the appropriate hormone. However, "paradoxical" responses of AP cells to the four well-established HRHs have been observed repeatedly with both in vivo and in vitro systems, raising the possibility of functional overlap between the different AP cell types. To explore this possibility, we evaluated the effects of HRHs on [Ca2+]i in single AP cells identified immunocytochemically by the hormone they stored. We found that each of the five major AP cell types contained discrete subpopulations that were able to respond to several HRHs. The relative abundance of these multi-responsive cells was 59% for lactotropes, 33% for thyrotropes, and in the range of 47-55% for gonadotropes, corticotropes, and somatotropes. Analysis of prolactin release from single living cells revealed that each of the four HRHs tested were able to induce hormone release from a discrete lactotrope subpopulation, the size of which corresponded closely to that in which [Ca2+]i changes were induced by the same secretagogues. When viewed as a whole, our diverse functional measurements of multi-responsiveness suggest that hypothalamic control of pituitary function is more complicated than previously envisioned. Moreover, they provide a cellular basis for the so-called "paradoxical" behavior of pituitary cells to hypothalamic hypophysiotropic agents.

TI  - The proteinase-antiproteinase theory of emphysema: a speculative analysis of recent advances into the pathogenesis of emphysema.  
AB  - This review concerns the reasons why only an estimated 10-15% of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency develop the destructive lung disease known as emphysema. The arguments presented revolve around the proteinase-antiproteinase balance in the 'microenvironment' of the epithelial space of the lung. Attention is focused on the balance between destructive enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and protective proteins such as A1AT, secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), human elastase inhibitor (HEI) and elafin. When neutrophil elastase is already attached to the elastin fibres the smaller molecules SLPI and elafin appear to be better inhibitors of this enzyme than larger inhibitors such as A1AT and HEI. Furthermore, SLPI and elafin may provide the first line of defence against proteinase attack from neutrophil elastase. In trying to explain the variability in the clinical expression of A1AT-deficiency and the development of emphysema, the importance of changes to A1AT, SLPI and elafin molecules induced by smoking and/or oxygen free radicals has been considered. It is possible that emphysema only develops in patients who have SLPI/elafin deficiency as well as A1AT deficiency.

TI  - Influence of residual C-peptide secretion on nocturnal serum TSH peak in well-controlled diabetic patients.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several alterations in hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) function have been described in diabetes mellitus and have been attributed to metabolic decompensation. The present study was performed in order to establish whether residual endogenous insulin secretion in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) may play a role in the control of HPT function. DESIGN: The nocturnal (2230 h-0200 h) serum TSH surge, the TSH response to TRH (200 microgram as an i.v. bolus) and serum free thyroid hormone levels were evaluated in C-peptide positive (CpP) (subjects with residual detectable endogenous pancreatic beta-cell activity) and C-peptide negative (CpN) patients both before and after optimization of metabolic status by 3 days of treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and in normal controls. TSH response to TRH and serum free thyroid hormone levels were assessed in the morning. SUBJECTS: Twenty male diabetic patients hospitalized to achieve a better control of hyperglycaemia were subdivided into 10 CpP (age: 33 +/- 1.5 years (mean +/- SE); body mass index (BMI): 22.6 +/- 0.3) and 10 CpN (age: 32 +/- 1.7 years; BMI: 22.5 +/- 0.4) patients. Nine normal men (age: 34.0 +/- 1.2 years; BMI: 23.1 +/- 0.4) served as controls. MEASUREMENTS: The nocturnal serum TSH peak was measured by dividing the highest night-time TSH value by the next morning TSH value and then multiplying by 100. Serum TSH levels were measured in samples taken just before (time 0) and 30 minutes, after TRH administration. Serum free thyroid hormone levels were measured in samples taken at time 0 of the TRH test. RESULTS: Before improvement of hyperglycaemia, CpP and CPN patients showed similar alterations in HPT function; i.e. serum free T3 levels and TSH responses to TRH were lower than normal; the nocturnal TSH surge was absent. Correction of hyperglycaemia normalized all examined HPT parameters in CpP diabetics, whereas normalization in serum free T3 levels and pituitary TSH responsiveness to TRH in CpN patients was not accompanied by restoration of the nocturnal TSH peak. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the absence of residual pancreatic beta-cell function in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with neuroendocrine dysfunction in the regulation of circadian TSH secretion, which is not reversible after restoration of good glycaemic control.

TI  - Mechanisms for de novo biogenesis of an apical membrane compartment in groups of simple epithelial cells surrounded by extracellular matrix.  
AB  - In open monolayers of epithelial cells grown in vitro, the apical membrane domain forms on the free cell surface that faces the culture medium. However, in vivo, the apical lumenal compartment arises within groups of cells that do not have a free cell surface. We designed in vitro culture conditions, using small colonies of MDCK cells overlaid with collagen, in which formation of the apical membrane must occur de novo by remodeling existing membrane domains that are contacted by other cells or extracellular matrix. Within 12 hours of collagen overlay, the apical membrane glycoprotein gp135 is removed from the free cell surface, while lateral membrane proteins (e.g. Na+,K+-ATPase) remain at sites of cell-cell contacts. Subsequently, lumenal structures, containing gp135 and the apically secreted protein gp81, formed within these cell-cell contacts. Na+,K+-ATPase, adherens junction (E-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenins) and tight junction (ZO-1) proteins were localized on the lateral membrane adjacent to, but excluded from the gp135-positive lumenal compartment. Therefore, each lumen represents a newly formed apical compartment on the lateral membrane. The Golgi complex (alpha-mannosidase II and Golgi beta-spectrin), centrosomes (gamma-tubulin) and microtubules reorient to a cytoplasmic position adjacent to the newly-forming apical lumenal compartments. Significantly, addition of colchicine, nocodazole or brefeldin A inhibits apical lumen formation. These results demonstrate that simple epithelial cells form an apical lumenal compartment de novo through initial intermixing, and then sorting of apical and basal-lateral membrane proteins at sites of cell-cell contacts. In addition, apical lumen formation requires an intact microtubule network, microtubule-dependent reorientation of the Golgi complex and secretory apparatus, and fully functional protein delivery from the Golgi complex to the forming apical cell surface.

TI  - Cortisol and TGF-beta inhibit secretion of platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase in a monocyte-macrophage model system [corrected] [published erratum appears in Mol Hum Reprod 1998 Jul;4(7):731]  
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that platelet activating factor (PAF) plays an important role in various reproductive functions, including ovulation, implantation and parturition, and that the local concentration of PAF is modulated by PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), a potent PAF inactivator. In this study, we investigated the possible effects of various bioactive substances, which are present at high concentrations in the human pregnant uterus, on PAF-AH secretion from decidual macrophages using a monocyte-macrophage model system, human myelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60). By treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), HL-60 cells were transformed to macrophage-like cells, which secreted PAF-AH into the culture medium time- and dose-dependently. After treatment with 10(-8) M TPA, the effects of various substances on the secretion of PAF-AH were examined. Among the substances examined, cortisol and TGF-beta suppressed PAF-AH secretion from TPA-stimulated HL-60 cells in a significant and dose-dependent way. Endothelin, epidermal growth factor, and brain natriuretic peptide had no significant effect on PAF-AH secretion from TPA-stimulated HL-60 cells. These results suggest that local PAF concentrations in the pregnant uterus might be regulated, at least partly, by cortisol and TGF-beta; thus these substances may play a role in the initiation of parturition via regulation of local PAF concentrations.

TI  - Identification of Mg-transporting renal tubules and cells by ion microscopy imaging of stable isotopes.  
AB  - Sites of renal Mg transport were identified in seawater killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) using a Cameca model IMS-3f ion microscope. Killifish were given an intraperitoneal injection of the stable isotope 26Mg (99.5% enrichment) to stimulate and trace renal Mg excretion. We identified two sites of 26Mg transport in frozen freeze-dried cryosections of kidney: the proximal tubule, known to secrete Mg, and the collecting duct, heretofore not known to handle Mg. In epithelial cells of the proximal tubule, the punctate distribution of injected 26Mg suggests transcytotic excretion of Mg in bound form. In collecting ducts, a subpopulation of Mg/Ca-rich cells was identified with high accumulations of injected 26Mg. Here, the punctate distribution of 26Mg decreased from the apical to the basal region of the cells, revealing a transcytotic gradient of apparently bound Mg. Since proximal tubules of fish are implicated with Mg secretion, Mg/Ca-rich cells in the collecting duct may reabsorb Mg, thereby providing the usual two-step of renal regulation, now also for Mg.

TI  - Endometrial effects of three doses of trimegestone, a new orally active progestogen, on the postmenopausal endometrium.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of oral trimegestone on endometrial histology and vaginal bleeding when given in combination with oral 17-beta-oestradiol. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel groups, pilot comparative study. Thirty-eight healthy postmenopausal women with normal endometrial histology were given oral 17-beta-oestradiol, 2 mg/day for three continuous cycles of 28 days, plus oral trimegestone, 0.10, 0.25 or 0.50 mg/day from day 15 to day 28 of each cycle. A Vabra biopsy was performed late in the oestradiol/trimegestone phase of cycle 3 and examined for histological evidence of secretory transformation of the endometrium. Characteristics of vaginal bleeding were recorded on a daily basis. RESULTS: Thirty-seven women completed the study, of whom 31 yielded adequate tissue for histological assessment. All showed secretory transformation of the endometrium. Bleeding was of earlier onset and longer duration with the lowest dose of trimegestone. CONCLUSIONS: Trimegestone is a highly effective oral progestogen for endometrial protection, all doses inducing secretory endometrial transformation. Although bleeding patterns suggest a weaker effect of the lowest dose used, the minimum effective dose for endometrial protection has still to be determined and may be lower than those used in this study.

AB  - Synthesis, storage, and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 have not been established in normal exocrine gland secretory cells. Parotid glands and isolated acinar cells prepared from BALB/c mice were homogenized for RNA isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IL-1 beta and IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were done on supernatants prepared from mouse parotid acinar cell (MPAC) preparations unstimulated or stimulated between 0 and 10 min with 10(-5) M norepinephrine at 37 degrees C. MPACs were fixed in paraformaldehyde, frozen sectioned for light and electron microscopy, and labeled with antibodies to IL-1 beta and IL-6. Mouse specific riboprobes to IL-1 and IL-6 were used for in situ hybridization. RT-PCR yielded the expected IL-1 (336-bp) and IL-6 (614-bp) mRNA products. By ELISA, stimulated MPACs showed a significant increase in IL-1 beta (P < 0.03) and IL-6 (P < 0.01) release into supernatants by 10 min that paralleled the time course of amylase release. In situ hybridization showed the presence of transcripts for IL-1 and IL-6 in glandular epithelial cells. Gold-labeled IL-1 beta and IL-6 were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in granules than in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This study shows that MPACs synthesize IL-1 beta and IL-6 and release these cytokines from their granules after alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation.

TI  - Plasmalogens effectively reduce the surface tension of surfactant-like phospholipid mixtures.  
AB  - The alkenyl-acyl subclass of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylcholine (plasmalogens) are minor components of alveolar surfactant. Plasmalogens promote and stabilize hexagonal structures of phospholipids. In another study (W.R. Perkins, R.B. Dause, R.A. Parente, S.R. Michey, K.C. Neuman, S.M. Gruner, T.F. Taraschi, and A.S. Janoff. Science 273: 330-332, 1996), it was shown that polymorphic phase behavior may have an important role in the effective functioning of pulmonary surfactant. Therefore, we hypothesized that surface properties of phospholipid mixtures that contain plasmalogens are superior to plasmalogen-free mixtures. The effect of plasmalogens on surface tension of surfactant-like phospholipid mixtures (70 mol% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 10 mol% phosphatidylglycerol, and 20 mol% PtdEtn) was measured. Using the pulsating bubble surfactometer, we show that an increasing amount of ethanolamine plasmalogens [plasmenylethanolamine (PlsEtn) results in reduction of surface tension (0 mol% PlsEtn 44.7 +/- 1.7, 2 mol% 33.5 +/- 1.7, 4 mol% 36 +/- 3.1, 6 mol% 26.2 +/- 2.9, and 8 mol% 22.2 +/- 0.3 mN/m). By means of the captive bubble surfactometer, minimal surface tension reached with 8 mol% PlsEtn was even lower (3.8 +/- 0.7 mN/m). With regard to morphological studies (B. Fringes, K. Gorgas, and A. Reith. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 46: 136-143, 1988), clofibrate treatment of rats might increase the plasmalogen content of alveolar surfactant. However, in the present study, we could not show that synthesis and secretion of plasmalogens are affected by clofibrate treatment.

TI  - Immunostimulatory DNA: sequence-dependent production of potentially harmful or useful cytokines.  
AB  - Certain bacterial immunostimulatory (i.s.) DNA sequences containing unmethylated CpG motifs stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APC) to express a full complement of costimulatory molecules and to produce cytokines including interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. While IL-12 is key to their T helper cell (Th)1-promoting adjuvant activity, secretion of toxic levels of TNF-alpha is harmful in that it promotes toxic shock. Given the beneficial as well as harmful consequences of i.s. DNA, we investigated the possibility of identifying DNA sequences, i.e. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) which differentially activate IL-12 versus TNF-alpha cytokine production in APC. Here, we describe an i.s. DNA sequence with these characteristics. While its potential to induce IL-12 is preserved, its ability to trigger TNF-alpha release is strongly curtailed both in vitro and in vivo. I.s. DNA could be segregated into lethal and non-lethal in a mouse toxic shock model. The non-toxic i.s. DNA was useful as an adjuvant, thus allowing cytotoxic T cell responses to the soluble protein ovalbumin and conferring a resistant Th 1 phenotype to BALB/c mice lethally infected with Leishmania major. This i.s. CpG motif may thus be prototypic for a useful immunostimulating DNA sequence that lacks harmful side effects.

For the studies in vitro, cultured rat cornea sections (3 mm diameter) were incubated with radiolabeled sodium sulfate, rinsed, and then incubated for 30 min in the presence of one of the drugs. The culture media were reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinate (DBA)-lectin, and the radioactivity of DBA-bound mucin-like glycoproteins was measured. A cytotoxicity assay confirmed that mucin-like glycoproteins had not leaked from damaged cells. For studies in vivo, eye drop vehicle or drops containing gefarnate were instilled in the eyes of nine anesthetized rabbits, and then the eyes were kept open with specula for two hours. These rabbits and two control rabbits not subjected to ocular drying were killed, and their eyes were enucleated and stained with methylene blue. Corneal epithelial damage from desiccation was evaluated based on the extent of methylene blue staining. Among the four kinds of drugs for gastritis and gastric ulcers, only gefarnate significantly increased the mucin-like glycoprotein secretion from cultured rat corneas in vitro; this stimulatory effect of gefarnate was dose-dependent. In vivo, the instillation of gefarnate reduced corneal epithelial damage from desiccation in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that gefarnate reduces desiccation of corneal epithelium, perhaps by stimulating secretion of mucin-like glycoproteins from corneal epithelium.

TI  - Immunolocalization of Hsp60 in Legionella pneumophila.  
AB  - One of the most abundant proteins synthesized by Legionella pneumophila, particularly during growth in a variety of eukaryotic host cells, is Hsp60, a member of the GroEL family of molecular chaperones. The present study was initiated in response to a growing number of reports suggesting that for some bacteria, including L. pneumophila, Hsp60 may exist in extracytoplasmic locations. Immunolocalization techniques with Hsp60-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to define the subcellular location and distribution of Hsp60 in L. pneumophila grown in vitro, or in vivo inside of HeLa cells. For comparative purposes Escherichia coli, expressing recombinant L. pneumophila Hsp60, was employed. In contrast to E. coli, where Hsp60 was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, in L. pneumophila Hsp60 was predominantly associated with the cell envelope, conforming to a distribution pattern typical of surface molecules that included the major outer membrane protein OmpS and lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, heat-shocked L. pneumophila organisms exhibited decreased overall levels of cell-associated Hsp60 epitopes and increased relative levels of surface epitopes, suggesting that Hsp60 was released by stressed bacteria.  Putative secretion of Hsp60 by L. pneumophila was further indicated by the accumulation of Hsp60 in the endosomal space, between replicating intracellular bacteria. These results are consistent with an extracytoplasmic location for Hsp60 in L. pneumophila and further suggest both the existence of a novel secretion mechanism (not present in E. coli) and a potential role in pathogenesis.

TI  - Secretory acetylcholinesterase of Setaria cervi microfilariae and its antigenic cross-reactivity with Wuchereria bancrofti.  
AB  - Setaria cervi, a bovine filarial parasite, secretes acetylcholinesterase during in vitro cultivation. A significant amount of enzyme activity was detected both in culture media and somatic extracts of different developmental stages of the parasite. The microfilarial stage showed a higher level of AChE activity than adult worms, with females being considerably more active than males. The secretory enzyme from microfilariae preferentially utilized acetylthiocholine iodide as substrate and showed two electrophoretically distinct isoforms in native PAGE.  Secretory enzyme was purified from the excretory/secretory products of microfilariae using edrophonium chloride linked to epoxy-activated sepharose. Analysis of purified acetylcholinesterase by SDS-PAGE revealed the existence of two proteins of 75kD and 45kD under nonreducing conditions. These secretory enzymes are antigenic and cross-reactive with Wuchereria bancrofti-infected asymptomatic microfilaraemic human sera when tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. The secretory AChE(s) from S. cervi microfilariae may be utilized for diagnosis of early filarial infections.

TI  - An antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to m-calpain mRNA inhibits secretion from alveolar epithelial type II cells.  
AB  - We investigated the effect of translational suppression of m-calpain on [3H]-phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion utilising an antisense oligodexoyribonucleotide (oligo) directed against mRNA encoding m-calpain catalytic subunit. Two types of oligo, sense (S) and antisense (AS), to a portion of exon 12 of rat m-calpain catalytic subunit mRNA were tested. Constitutive secretion was decreased by 23% by AS-oligo (1 microM) treatment, while S-oligo (1 microM) had no effect. TPA-stimulated secretion was inhibited about 50-60% by AS-oligo (1-3 microM) and the inhibition was concentration-dependent, while S-oligo (1 microM) only inhibited about 10% of TPA-stimulated secretion. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that the AS-oligo treatment reduced m-calpain mRNA and protein levels by 32% and 78%, respectively. The data indicate that antisense strategy is effective in suppressing calpain expression and type II cell secretion.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the GH/IGF-I system in the control of secretory activity by oviductal cells. The effects of GH (1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/ml medium) on IGF-I production, as well as the action of GH and IGF-I (1, 10, 100 ng/ml medium) on cAMP and prostaglandin F alpha (PGF) secretion by cultured bovine oviduct epithelial cells were studied. It was observed that GH at all doses tested significantly (p < 0.05) increased IGF-I secretion. Moreover, both GH and IGF-I significantly stimulated cAMP production by oviductal cells. On the other hand, PGF release was significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited by both GH and IGF-I at all concentrations tested. Our results demonstrate that: (1) oviductal cells can produce PGF alpha, cAMP and IGF-I, (2) production of PGF alpha is under inhibitory regulation by GH and IGF-I, (3) GH/IGF can activate cAMP-dependent intracellular mechanisms, which might be the mediators of GH/IGF-I action on oviductal cells. These observations confirm the involvement of GH/IGF-I system in control of oviductal prostaglandin and cyclic nucleotide secretion.

TI  - Intracellular transport and secretion of salivary proteins.  
AB  - Intracellular transport and secretion of salivary proteins are major activities of salivary acinar cells. While the major intracellular pathway followed by salivary proteins following their synthesis has been described previously, there is only limited understanding of how this process is regulated at the molecular level. Studies of salivary proteins, especially proline-rich proteins, expressed in an endocrine cell line have begun to provide insight regarding intermolecular interactions during transport and the role played by structural signals during intracellular sorting. Analysis of the secretion of newly synthesized salivary proteins in parotid tissue has shown that there are multiple pathways of discharge from acinar cells. While granule exocytosis is the major pathway, at least two other pathways that export salivary proteins have been found to originate from maturing secretion granules. These pathways may contribute to other acinar cell functions, including secretion of proteins in the absence of acute stimulation and support of the secretory process for fluid and electrolytes.

TI  - Augmentation of naive, Th1 and Th2 effector CD4 responses by IL-6, IL-1 and TNF.  
AB  - The role of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-derived cytokines in T cell activation is still controversial. Highly purified CD4 T cell populations of the naive and short-term Th1 and Th2 effector subsets were examined. Stimulation from anti-CD3 in the absence of APC was used to analyze directly T occurring cell-mediated effects, and the requirement for co-signaling was addressed using anti-CD28. Exogenous IL-6, IL-1 and TNF each enhanced proliferation and IL-2 secretion from naive cells, although IL-6 was most active in this regard. Peak responses, however, were obtained with IL-1 or TNF in combination with IL-6 resulting in up to 11-fold increases in IL-2 secretion. Enhanced naive T cell responses were only observed with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, suggesting that co-signaling through surface-bound receptors was required to initiate IL-2 production. Although the cytokines enhanced naive activation, little effect was seen on differentiation into effector populations. IL-6 alone, or in combination, partially suppressed effectors secreting IFN-gamma, but did not promote generation of effectors secreting IL-4. In contrast to reports on cloned cell lines, IL-6, TNF and IL-1 had enhancing activities on all cytokines elicited from already generated Th1 and Th2 effector populations. Again combinations of IL-6, TNF and IL-1 were most effective and generally required CD28 signaling. Induced responses with preexisting effector cells were far less than with naive cells and predominantly directed at augmenting IFN-gamma and IL-5 secretion rather than IL-2 and IL-4. These studies show that APC-derived cytokines can promote T cell responses directly but largely after co-stimulation from accessory molecule co-receptors, that the effect is not specific for one T cell subset or cytokine, and that the naive T cell is the main target of action.

TI  - An antigen valence theory to explain the evolution and organization of the humoral immune response.  
AB  - The three modes of antibody production, natural, T independent (TI) and T dependent (TD) are conserved among vertebrate species suggesting an important role for each in protection against pathogens. Here, I use an artificial 'universe' to argue that the three modes of antibody production represent layers that evolved to deal optimally with antigens of different valence. Thus, the apparently more sophisticated TD response has not superseded the natural and TI components of the humoral immune response. Furthermore, the characteristic differences in isotype, somatic mutation and memory displayed by each antibody layer are appropriate for their targeted range of surface structures. It is also suggested that the TD and TI activation arms are at the extremes of a continuum, with signal integration of antigen and T cell-derived signals contributing to B cell decisions about isotype selection, proliferation and secretion that minimize the time to protection.

AB  - This open-label, randomized, placebo lead-in, three-treatment crossover study in 19 hypogonadal men (27-82 years of age) evaluated dose proportionality of serum testosterone concentrations with application of one or two investigational transdermal testosterone systems for application to the arm or torso. Testosterone in vivo kinetics profiles were determined using DeMonS, a recently developed numerical deconvolution method that estimates drug absorption at different time intervals and/or drug disposition model parameters. After application of the investigational transdermal systems, the mean serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and free testosterone concentrations were elevated to normal levels. Treatment allowed approximation of the normal circadian pattern of endogenous testosterone secretion, and the increase in serum testosterone concentrations was proportional to the surface area of systems applied. The investigational transdermal system provided effective testosterone replacement therapy as judged by pharmacokinetic parameters.

TI  - Effects of octreotide on glycaemic control, glucose disposal, hepatic glucose production and counterregulatory hormones secretion in type 1 and type 2 insulin treated diabetic patients.  
AB  - We studied the effects of continuous subcutaneous infusion of octreotide (100 micrograms/day for 5 days) on glycaemic values, counterregulatory hormones secretion, hepatic glucose production (HGP) and glucose disposal during an euglycaemic clamp in 7 C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic patients and 7 C-peptide positive insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients. In type 1, but not type 2 diabetic patients, octreotide significantly reduced glycaemic values (P < 0.005) and also diminished HGP during an euglycaemic clamp (P < 0.05). However, insulin stimulated global glucose uptake remained unchanged. GH, glucagon, IGF-I, IGFBP-3 levels, were significantly lowered by octreotide in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients whereas cortisol and epinephrine remained unmodified. Moreover in type 2 diabetic patients both basal (P < 0.05) and after-meal (P < 0.01) C-peptide secretion was reduced by octreotide. These data point to different metabolic effects of octreotide in type 1 versus type 2 diabetic patients with the drug only being able to reduce glycaemic values and HGP in the former but not in the latter subjects. The failure of octreotide to diminish glycaemic values and HGP in type 2 diabetic patients in spite of its ability to lower GH and glucagon may probably depend on temporary blockage of residual endogenous insulin secretion induced by octreotide administration.

TI  - Interferon gamma induces differential upregulation of alpha and beta chemokine secretion in colonic epithelial cell lines.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of chemoattractant factors by the intestinal epithelium may contribute to mucosal infiltration by inflammatory cells in inflammatory bowel disease. Secretion of the alpha chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), a neutrophil chemoattractant, has been widely studied, but little is known about epithelial secretion of beta chemokines, which are preferentially involved in recruiting monocytes. AIMS: To investigate the profiles of alpha and beta chemokine secretion in colonic cell lines and their differential modulation by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), a product of activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: HT29-19A, a model of the CT secretory crypt cell, exhibited a parallel secretion of the alpha chemokines IL-8 and GRO alpha, which could be markedly upregulated by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1 beta. These cells showed no significant expression of the beta chemokines RANTES (regulated upon activation T cell expressed and secreted), MIP-1 alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha), and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) under these conditions, but IFN-gamma in combination with TNF-alpha caused a dose dependent induction of RANTES and MCP-1 secretion. This was accompanied by a marked increase of RANTES mRNA. In contrast, IFN-gamma had no significant effect on TNF-alpha stimulated IL-8 secretion. Caco-2 cells, with features more typical of villus absorptive cells, were relatively poor secretors of alpha chemokines but secreted high levels of MCP-1 in response to IL-1 beta. IFN-gamma did not influence alpha or beta chemokine secretion in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that intestinal epithelial cells may produce chemokines capable of attracting both neutrophils and monocytes. The ability of IFN-gamma to activate the expression of beta chemokines preferentially could facilitate the development of chronic inflammatory infiltrates.

AB  - To investigate the role of retinoids on human placental development and functions, we characterized the spatial distribution of retinoid receptors in human term chorionic villi. In situ hybridization with 35S labeled sense and antisense probes for the RARs, alpha, beta, gamma and RXRs, alpha, beta, gamma, specifically detected only RAR alpha and RXR alpha. Both RAR alpha and RXR alpha mRNA were preferentially expressed in the trophoblast cell layer. This syncytiotrophoblast expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses using anti-RAR alpha and RXR alpha antibodies. Using trophoblast cells in culture, we then studied the effect on hCG secretion of 0.1 microM RA physiological forms and of selective RAR alpha and RXR alpha synthetic agonists. Only RXR alpha specific ligands such as physiological 9-cis RA and synthetic Ro 25-7386 stimulated hCG secretion (doubled). These results suggest an important role for RXR alpha in human placental development and function.

TI  - [Interrelationship between human cytomegalovirus infection and chemokine]  
AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is frequently associated with AIDS patients and immunocompromised recipients of organ transplants. The progression of HCMV infection is related to a complex interrelation of virus replication with the host immune system, including soluble and cellular factors. A chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8), is essentially involved in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury. Moreover, several chemokine receptors are co-receptor for HIV entry. Hence, we investigated the effects of IL-8 on HCMV replication in human embryonic fibroblasts, MRC-5 cells. IL-8 augmented both infectious virus production and replication of HCMV, with concomitant increases in the levels of both the HCMV pp71 genome and the synthesis of the HCMV late antigen. The enhancing effect of IL-8 was observed at concentration from 0.1 ng to 10 ng of IL-8/ml, showing a dose-response relationship similar to that observed in the neutrophil chemotactic activity of IL-8. IL-8 did not enhance the growth of MRC-5 cells, indicating that IL-8 enhanced HCMV replication and virus production without affecting the proliferation of host cells. We also found that HCMV selectively induced transcripts of CXCR-1 in fibroblasts by RT-PCR, but significant numbers of binding sites could not be detected on HCMV infected cells by using 125I-labeled IL-8. Thus, IL-8 may enhance HCMV replication in fibroblasts through interaction with small number of CXCR-1. Furthermore, HCMV infection induced IL-8 gene transcription in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, leading to IL-8 secretion. It is unlikely that HCMV infection enhanced IL-8 production indirectly by inducing the production of some soluble factors, because virus-free filtrated HCMV or UV-irradiated HCMV infected supernatants failed to induce IL-8 production. The functional analysis of the IL-8 gene revealed that both AP-1 and NF-kB factor-binding element were involved in conferring the responsiveness to HCMV. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the formation of AP-1 and NF-kB complex was observed upon HCMV infection. These results suggest that IL-8 produced upon HCMV infection, may aggravate HCMV infection by enhancing its replication. Thus, IL-8 and CXCR-1 might be a novel target for intervention therapy for opportunistic HCMV infection.

TI  - Endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin during diestrus and early pregnancy in pigs is not controlled solely by changes in oxytocin receptor population density.  
AB  - These studies were performed to test the hypotheses that: 1) endometrial responsiveness to oxytocin (OT) in pig endometrium is associated with changes in OT receptor (OTr) population density resulting from corresponding regulation of OTr gene transcription, 2) endometrial responsiveness to OT is controlled solely through a mechanism involving changes in OTr population density, and 3) OTr population density and endometrial responsiveness to OT differ between diestrus and early pregnancy in pigs. In experiment 1, OTr population density and dissociation constant (Kd) in cyclic pigs were constant on Days 10-16 but increased (p < 0.05) between Days 10 and 12 of pregnancy before decreasing (p < 0.05) through Day 16. OT induced phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs only on Day 16 (p < 0.05), and during pregnancy only on Day 12 (p < 0.05). Activation of G protein by aluminum fluoride (AIF4-) treatment maximally stimulated (p < 0.05) PI hydrolysis and PGF2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs on all days, indicating that downstream from the OTr, the PGF2 alpha secretory pathway was fully functional. During pregnancy, PI hydrolysis and PGF2 alpha secretion in response to AIF4- decreased (p < 0.01) on Days 14 compared to Days 10 and 12, and AIF4- did not stimulate PGF2 alpha release on Day 16. In experiment 2, abundance of OTr mRNA in cyclic pigs decreased between Days 0 and 5 before increasing between Days 5 and 12 (p < 0.05), but it was higher (p < 0.05) on Days 10-15 of pregnancy than on equivalent days in cyclic gilts. These results indicate that control of PGF2 alpha secretion in cyclic pigs appeared to occur primarily at the level of OTr coupling to G protein because changes in OTr number were not associated with increased sensitivity to OT or G-protein activation by AIF4-. During pregnancy, control was exerted at multiple levels, which included the OTr, G protein, phospholipase C, and subsequent aspects of the secretory pathway. The present study also indicated that endometrium was responsive to OT during luteolysis in cyclic pigs but not during corpus luteum maintenance in pregnant pigs.

TI  - Experimental studies on the bacterial product CANTASTIM derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. III. Suppression of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha: are the lipid components involved?  
AB  - We previously reported that the bacterial immunomodulator CANTASTIM inhibited the LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in murine macrophages both in vivo and in vitro. In this report, we compared the activity of CANTASTIM with that of two phospholipids (cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine) which are among the components of its lipid fraction. We noticed a significant reduction in the production of TNF-alpha upon stimulation with LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages pretreated for at least 3 h with CANTASTIM or cardiolipin. CANTASTIM was active at much lower concentrations than cardiolipin. Preliminary experiments with partially deacylated CANTASTIM indicated some decrease of TNF-alpha secretion. However, further studies are necessary to clarify this matter. Also, while CANTASTIM and its partially deacylated derivative could trigger the TNF-alpha secretion in murine macrophages, individual phospholipids did not. Based on these results, we concluded that CANTASTIM could induce the TNF-alpha suppression by multiple mechanisms, including the induction of regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and CD14 receptor blockade/downregulation.

TI  - Enhancement of type IV collagenases by highly metastatic variants of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells established by a transendothelial invasion system in vitro.  
AB  - A novel in vitro invasion assay system was established in this laboratory, in which the invasion of tumor cells after interaction with endothelial cells could be examined. Two variant cell lines (FP-10, FP-21) were established from parental HT1080 cells using this assay system. FP-10 and FP-21 cells had higher invasive and metastatic potential than the parental cells both in vitro and in vivo. The activity of anchorage-independent proliferation and the adhesion to the HUVEC monolayer of FP-10 and FP-21 was greater than the parental cells.  The secretion of type IV collagenase (both MMP-2 and MMP-9) was also increased more significantly by the variant cells than by the parental cells, and the expression of uPA mRNA was higher in FP-10 and FP-21. Treatment of variant cells with human TIMP-2 remarkably suppressed the increment of the in vitro invasion to the same level as parental cells. These results suggest that this in vitro transendothelial invasion system accelerates multiple mechanisms of the metastasis by HT1080, especially the production of type IV collagenases. It can thus provide a useful model of tumor metastasis.

TI  - Parafusin is a membrane and vesicle associated protein that cycles at exocytosis.  
AB  - In the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, stimulation of exocytosis leads to Ca2+ activation of an alpha Glc-1-phosphodiesterase that dephosphoglucosylates the phosphoglycoprotein parafusin (PFUS). This process fails in exo mutant nd9 and also in the absence of Ca2+ influx upon stimulation suggesting that PFUS dephosphoglucosylation may be causally related to exocytosis. To further corroborate the hypothesis that PFUS is involved in the molecular events in exocytosis, we used laser confocal scanning microscopy and a PFUS specific peptide antibody to perform localization studies of PFUS in wild type (wt) and mutant Paramecium. In unstimulated wt cells, PFUS was associated both with the exocytic site of the cell membrane and with the membrane of the dense core secretory vesicles. Localization at these two sites was shown to be independent of each other since the exocytosis mutant (exo-) tam8, in which docking of its vesicles is blocked, still showed cell membrane staining. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of isolated intact secretory vesicles also revealed PFUS association. Upon stimulation of exocytosis, PFUS dissociated from both the dense core secretory vesicles and the cell membrane in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. During recovery of exocytic capacity, PFUS reassociated with the newly formed secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm prior to their docking at the exocytic sites. Immunoblot analysis of PFUS during this time showed no changes in levels of the protein. Stimulation of exocytosis in wt in Mg2+ buffer or in the exo- temperature sensitive mutant (nd9) at the non-permissive temperature did not lead to dissociation of the PFUS. We conclude that PFUS is a novel critical component whose cycling probably participates in the molecular exocytic fusion machinery in these cells.

TI  - Bradykinin-induced responses in a coaxial bioassay system composed of rat anococcygeus muscle and guinea pig trachea.  
AB  - 1. Epithelium-dependent effects of bradykinin (BK) were investigated in a coaxial bioassay system which consisted of guinea pig trachea as donor organ and rat anococcygeus muscle as test tissue. 2. BK (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) produced concentration-dependent relaxations on the phenylephrine (3 x 10(-6) M)-precontracted rat anococcygeus muscle mounted alone. Relaxations decreased significantly when muscle was mounted in epithelium-intact trachea. There was also a significant difference between the relaxations obtained in the muscle within epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded trachea (at 10(-7) to 10(-5) M concentrations). 3. Capsaicin (10(-5) M) pretreatment did not change BK (10(-9) to 10(-5) M)-induced relaxations in each preparation compared with vehicle pretreatment. Indomethacin (10(-6) M) in combination with thiorphan (10(-5) M) and atropine (10(-6) M) did not affect the BK-induced relaxations of the muscle within capsaicin-pretreated epithelium-intact or denuded trachea. 4. CGS 8515 (a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, 10(-6) M) did not change BK (10(-5) M)-induced relaxation on the muscle alone, and caused an increase of BK-induced relaxation on the muscle within epithelium-intact trachea compared with that obtained without CGS 8515. 5. Results showed that epithelial or nonepithelial factors were capable of modulating the responsiveness of rat anococcygeus muscle to BK. The decreased relaxation by BK in anococcygeus muscle did not occur by the release of cyclooxygenase products or tachykinins from tracheal epithelium, but it may have occurred by the contractile action of lipoxygenase product secreted by nonepithelial sources. In addition, BK might stimulate the secretion of an epithelium-derived inhibitory factor from the trachea.

TI  - Influence of feed restriction during lactation on gonadotropic hormones and ovarian development in primiparous sows.  
AB  - Effects of nutritional deficit during lactation on secretion of gonadotropic hormones and ovarian follicular populations around weaning were investigated in 24 primiparous crossbred sows. Sows were allocated to receive close to ad libitum intakes (H) or approximately 50% of this amount (L) during a 28-d lactation. Serial blood samples were collected 1 d before weaning (W-1), in the hours following weaning (W), and 1 d after (W+1). Their ovaries were removed on the day of weaning or 2 d later (W+2) and subjected to macroscopic and histological observations. Mean and basal LH concentrations were not influenced by the level of feeding. Frequency of LH pulses was reduced in L sows (.17, .5, and .5 vs 1.50, 1.17, and .83 pulses/6 h at d W-1, W, and W+1 respectively; P < .05). Mean and basal concentrations of LH were influenced by the day of sampling, being significantly increased within hours following weaning. Mean FSH concentrations were influenced neither by the level of feeding nor by the day of sampling. At weaning, the ovaries from L sows were lighter and had smaller follicles and fewer follicles > or = 4 mm (P < .05). Values of these macroscopic characteristics increased after weaning ( P < .05). At weaning, the percentage of healthy follicles was higher in the first class (< 1 mm) and lower in the second class (1 to 2.99 mm) in L compared to H sows (P < .05). Whatever the day of sampling, IGF-I concentrations in follicular fluid tended to be lower in L than in H sows. These results indicate that feed restriction during lactation inhibits LH pulsatility and ovarian activity.

TI  - Effect of human and murine interferon-alpha on steroid production by rat ovarian cells.  
AB  - The effect of interferon on the rat ovarian cell function was investigated. Cells from the ovary of juvenile rats were used as a model to investigate the effect of IFN-alpha on the secretion of estradiol and testosterone. In addition the effect of human IFN-alpha (hIFN-alpha) on the secretion of testosterone by the rat adult testis was studied. Present results show that leukocyte hIFN-alpha decreased the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulated secretion of estradiol and testosterone by ovarian cells, and the production of testosterone by testis cells. Basal secretion of steroids was affected later and in less proportion than the hCG-dependent production. The IFN-alpha obtained from murine leukocytes, also inhibited the response of ovarian cells to the hCG stimulus.The nature of this effect in the secretion of the steroids is dose and time-dependent. The incubation of hIFN-alpha with an specific antibody completely blocked the effect of the cytokine on ovarian cells.

TI  - A phogrin-aequorin chimaera to image free Ca2+ in the vicinity of secretory granules.  
AB  - Microdomains of high Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) may be critical to the control of intracellular processes such as secretion and metabolism without compromising other cell functions. To explore changes in [Ca2+] in the outer mantle (< 30 nm deep) that surrounds the surface of dense-core secretory granules, we have designed a recombinant chimaera between the granule protein phogrin and aequorin. When expressed in populations of insulin-secreting MIN6 or phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells, the chimaera was targeted to secretory granules as expected. The recombinant protein reported a similar [Ca2+] at the granule surface to that in the bulk cytosol, measured with untargeted aequorin. This was the case both at rest (-Ca2+- = 80-120 nM) and after stimulation with agents that provoke Ca2+ entry or Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular pools, and during activated secretion. Thus depolarization of MIN6 cell populations with high K+ increased [Ca2+] both in the bulk cytosol and close to the granules to approx. 4 microM, with near-identical kinetics of increase and recovery. Similarly, stimulation of PC12 cells with ATP provoked an increase in -Ca2+- in either domain to 1.3 microM. These data argue that, in MIN6 and PC12 neuroendocrine cells (i) significant mobilization of Ca2+ from most secretory granules probably does not occur during activated Ca2+ influx or mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores, and (ii) agonist-stimulated Ca2+-dependent secretion can occur without development of a large gradient of [Ca2+] between the surface of most secretory vesicles and the rest of the cytosol.

TI  - Expression and secretion of beta-galactosidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the signal sequences of GgpI, the major yeast glycosylphosphatidylinositol-containing protein.  
AB  - New secretory signals and strategies can be attempted to improve the secretion of heterologous proteins of biotechnological interest which encounter difficulties being exported in yeast. The GGPI gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for a 125 kDa glycoprotein transported through the secretory pathway and anchored to the plasma membrane by means of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The regions coding for the secretory signal or also for the first 46 amino acids were tested for efficiency in secretion by fusion to the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli resulting in the synthesis of the endoplasmic reticulum-targeted 1-22- and 1-68-GgpIp/beta-gal hybrids. A cytoplasmic form was also examined. The 1-22 beta gal is partially transported to the cell surface and in the medium in an unglycosylated form. The 1-68 beta gal is completely retained in the intracellular membranes and is N-glycosylated in the GgpIp moiety. The amount of hybrid protein produced is similar and independent from its targeted site, suggesting that translocation through endoplasmic reticulum is not a limiting step, whereas the amount of active enzyme is from 50 to 80% lower for the endoplasmic reticulum forms compared with the cytoplasmic form. BiP/Kar2p putative precursor is accumulated in cells expressing the endoplasmic reticulum-targeted forms but not in those producing the cytosolic beta-galactosidase or over-expressing an endogenous secretory protein. Thus, glycosylation and abnormal folding rather than over-expression are among the factors responsible for the decreased activity and exit of beta-galactosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum and for induction of BiP. The results obtained indicate that the sole secretory signal of GgpIp is suitable to drive secretion of foreign products with complex folding and point to the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control in the secretion of heterologous proteins in yeast.

TI  - Relaxin inhibits the pulsatile release of oxytocin but increases basal concentrations of hormone in lactating rats.  
AB  - The effects of porcine relaxin were examined in urethane-anesthetized, lactating rats to clarify the actions of relaxin on basal levels and the pulsatile release of oxytocin during suckling. Baseline plasma oxytocin concentrations were 27.6+/-2.9 pM in unsuckled rats. They were significantly increased in rats after the onset of suckling (34.5+/-2.4 pM) compared with unsuckled animals. Oxytocin concentrations were increased further during reflex milk ejection (41.2+/-2.7 pM). Treatment with porcine relaxin (5 microg in 0.1 ml saline) caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in plasma oxytocin compared with pretreatment concentrations or saline injection in all three groups. Frequent blood samples were taken before and during milk ejection to confirm pulsatile oxytocin associated with reflex milk ejection. Short-lived (5-10-sec) pulses with peak concentrations of oxytocin 392.4+/-122.1 pM were observed shortly before or at the time of the peak rise in intramammary pressure associated with reflex milk ejection. Relaxin (5 microg i.v.) completely suppressed the pulsatile release of oxytocin. These data suggest that relaxin increases basal secretion of oxytocin but inhibits the pulsatile secretion associated with reflex milk ejection.

TI  - Tonic neurogenic inhibition of interleukin-6 secretion from murine spleen caused by opioidergic transmission.  
AB  - The peripheral nervous system and the immune system were shown to have neurohumoral interactions. This study extends observations that demonstrated neuronal modulation of spontaneous interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion in the spleen by norepinephrine (NE) and beta-endorphin. Spontaneous IL-6 secretion in vivo was markedly reduced by removal of macrophages with the clodronate technique. Furthermore, spontaneous IL-6 secretion was significantly inhibited at physiological concentrations of cortisol (10(-7) M). In the presence of 10(-7) M cortisol, addition of norepinephrine (NE; 10(-5) M) and isoproterenol (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) significantly increased spontaneous IL-6 secretion (+20%; P = 0.0280, P = 0.0005, and P = 0.0050, respectively). In contrast, addition of beta-endorphin significantly inhibited spontaneous IL-6 secretion in the presence of 10(-7) M cortisol (-40%; 10(-11) M, P = 0.0410; 10(-10) M, P = 0.0005). To study the effect of endogenously released transmitters on spontaneous IL-6 secretion, spleen slices were electrically stimulated with 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 Hz. Spontaneous IL-6 secretion was markedly reduced at a frequency of 10 Hz with 10(-7) M cortisol present (P < 0.0001). This indicates that the combination of nerve firing at 5-10 Hz and physiological cortisol conditions inhibits spontaneous IL-6 secretion. Inhibition of spontaneous IL-6 secretion from spleen macrophages is most probably due to a net inhibitory effect of opioidergic transmission under these conditions.

TI  - Identification of two regions in apolipoprotein B100 that are exposed on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.  
AB  - Protease protection assays of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) in digitonin-permeabilized HepG2 cells indicated that multiple domains of apoB are exposed to the cytosol through an extensive portion of the secretory pathway. The intracellular orientation of apoB in the secretory pathway was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies recognizing specific domains of apoB in streptolysin-O (STP-O)- and saponin-permeabilized HepG2 cells. Lumenal epitopes on marker proteins in secretory pathway compartments (p63, p53, and galactosyltransferase) were not stained by antibodies in STP-O-treated cells, but were brightly stained in saponin-treated cells, confirming that internal membranes were not perforated in STP-O-treated cells. An anti-apoB peptide antibody (B4) recognizing amino acids 3221-3240 caused intense staining in close proximity to the nuclear membrane, and less intensely throughout the secretory pathway in STP-O-permeabilized cells. Staining with this antibody was similar in STP-O- and saponin-treated cells, indicating that this epitope in apoB is exposed to the cytosol at the site of apoB synthesis and throughout most of the remaining secretory pathway. Similar results indicating a cytosolic orientation were obtained with monoclonal antibody CC3.4, which recognizes amino acids 690-797 (79-91 kD) in apoB. Two polyclonal antibodies made to human LDL and two monoclonal antibodies recognizing amino acids 1878-2148 (D7.2) and 3214-3506 (B1B6) in apoB did not produce a strong reticular signal for apoB in STP-O-treated cells. The anti-LDL and B1B6 antibodies produced almost identical punctate patterns in STP-O-treated cells that overlapped with LAMP-1, a membrane marker for lysosomes. These observations suggest that the B1B6 epitope of apoB is exposed on the surface of the lysosome. The results identify two specific regions in apoB that are exposed to the cytosol in the secretory pathway.

TI  - Pathogen-induced chemokine secretion from model intestinal epithelium is inhibited by lipoxin A4 analogs.  
AB  - Enteric pathogens induce intestinal epithelium to secrete chemokines that direct movement of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Mechanisms that might downregulate secretion of these proinflammatory chemokines and thus contain intestinal inflammation have not yet been elucidated. The antiinflammatory activities exhibited by the arachidonate metabolite lipoxin A4 (LXA4) suggests that this eicosanoid, which is biosynthesized in vivo at sites of inflammation, might play such a role. We investigated whether chemokine secretion could be regulated by stable analogs of LXA4. Monolayers of T84 intestinal epithelial cells were infected with Salmonella typhimurium, which elicits secretion of distinct apical (pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant) and basolateral (IL-8) chemokines. Stable analogs of LXA4 inhibited S. typhimurium-induced (but not phorbol ester-induced) secretion of both IL-8 and pathogen-elicited epithelial chemoattractant. LXA4 stable analogs did not alter bacterial adherence to nor internalization by epithelia, indicating that LXA4 stable analogs did not block all signals that Salmonella typhimurium activates in intestinal epithelia, but likely led to attenuation of signals that mediate chemokine secretion. Inhibition of S. typhimurium-induced IL-8 secretion by LXA4 analogs was concentration- (IC50 approximately 1 nM) and time-dependent (maximal inhibition approximately 1 h). As a result of these effects, LXA4 stable analogs inhibited the ability of bacteria-infected epithelia to direct polymorphonuclear leukocyte movement. These data suggest that LXA4 and its stable analogs may be useful in downregulating active inflammation at mucosal surfaces.

TI  - Galanin inhibits glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and ATP-dependent potassium channels in rat ileal L-cells.  
AB  - The neuropeptide galanin is widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts several inhibitory effects, especially on intestinal motility and on insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells. The presence of galanin fibres not only in the myenteric and submucosal plexus but also in the mucosa, prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of galanin, and its mechanism of action, on the secretion of the insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Rat ileal cells were dispersed through mechanical vibration followed by moderate exposure to hyaluronidase, DNase I and EDTA, and enriched for L-cells by counterflow elutriation. A 6- to 7-fold enrichment in GLP-1 cell content was registered after elutriation, as compared with the crude cell preparation (929 +/- 81 vs 138 +/- 14 fmol/10(6) cells). L-cells then accounted for 4-5% of the total cell population. Bombesin induced a time-(15-240 min) and dose- (0.1 nM-1 microM) dependent release of GLP-1. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP, 100 nM), forskolin (10 microM) and the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 1 microM) each stimulated GLP-1 secretion over a 1-h incubation period. Galanin (0.01-100 nM) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of bombesin- and of GIP-stimulated GLP-1 release (mean inhibition of 90% with 100 nM galanin). Galanin also dose-dependently inhibited forskolin-induced GLP-1 secretion (74% of inhibition with 100 nM galanin), but not TPA-stimulated hormone release. Pretreatment of cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 3 h, or incubation with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker disopyramide (200 microM), prevented the inhibition by galanin of bombesin- and GIP-stimulated GLP-1 secretion. These studies indicate that intestinal secretion of GLP-1 is negatively controlled by galanin, that acts through receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and involves ATP-dependent K+ channels.

TI  - Mouse models of Hermansky Pudlak syndrome: a review.  
AB  - Hermansky Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a recessively inherited disease affecting the contents and/or the secretion of several related subcellular organelles including melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules. It presents with disorders of pigmentation, prolonged bleeding, and ceroid deposition, often accompanied by severe fibrotic lung disease and colitis. In the mouse, the disorder is clearly multigenic, caused by at least 14 distinct mutations. Studies on the mouse mutants have defined the granule abnormalities of HPS and have shown that the disease is associated with a surprising variety of phenotypes affecting many tissues. This is an exciting time in HPS research because of the recent molecular identification of the gene causing a major form of human HPS and the expected identifications of several mouse HPS genes. Identifications of mouse HPS genes are expected to increase our understanding of intracellular vesicle trafficking, lead to discovery of new human HPS genes, and suggest diagnostic and therapeutic approaches toward the more severe clinical consequences of the disease.

TI  - The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: an unusual presentation for childhood craniopharyngioma: report of three cases.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Childhood craniopharyngiomas may present with variable endocrine dysfunctions. However, hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone has never been reported. We describe three children with craniopharyngioma who presented with hyponatremia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Three children had hyponatremia at presentation, two of whom had experienced generalized seizures. Urine sodium levels measured in two patients were abnormally high. Neuroimaging tests, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, showed a large partially calcified and partially cystic craniopharyngioma in the sellar/suprasellar location. INTERVENTION: Intake of fluids was restricted for each patient, with improvement of hyponatremia, and each patient subsequently underwent a successful tumor resection. Postoperatively, all patients developed panhypopituitarism, including diabetes insipidus, and needed multiple hormonal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Endocrine dysfunctions at diagnosis are commonly associated with childhood craniopharyngiomas, but the association of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone with craniopharyngioma has never been reported. Craniopharyngiomas should be included as a possibility in making the differential diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in children.

TI  - Inter-regulated balance between gelatinases and tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) in isolated human glomeruli.  
AB  - Leukocyte infiltration inside glomeruli necessitates basement membrane collagen i.v. breakdown and leads to mesangiolysis, cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis during the repair process as observed in the course of acute glomerulonephritis, vasculitis and acute graft rejection. Two matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinases, are expressed and co-secreted in balance with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) by activated neutrophils as well as by glomerular cells and are aimed to control basement membrane collage i.v. deposition. Using a conventional double mesh sieving method, pure populations of glomeruli were isolated from fresh human cortex specimen and maintained in short-term cultures. ELISA, zymography and immunoblotting of conditioned serum-free media revealed glomerular MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 secretion and activity while reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of cellular RNA demonstrated glomerular transcripts coding for these enzymes and their inhibitor. When purified neutrophils were allowed to adhere onto Transwell apparatus in contact with glomerular suspensions, neutrophil 92 kDa gelatinase seemed apparently inhibited mainly because the production of TIMP-1 was enhanced on both sides of the insert. Glomerular 72 kDa and 92 kDa gelatinases were activated shortly (1 to 6 h) after neutrophils had interacted with glomeruli and furthermore upon activation by inflammatory or vasoactive mediators such as phorbol. Decreased neutrophil MMP-9 activity together with reduced MMP-9 mRNA levels and protracted TIMP-1 transcription and secretion during cell-cell interaction could participate to cell detachment from degraded basement membranes and to increased collagen i.v. deposition leading to glomerulosclerosis after initial glomerular injury by inflammatory cells.

TI  - The Caulobacter crescentus paracrystalline S-layer protein is secreted by an ABC transporter (type I) secretion apparatus.  
AB  - Caulobacter crescentus is a gram-negative bacterium that produces a two-dimensional crystalline array on its surface composed of a single 98-kDa protein, RsaA. Secretion of RsaA to the cell surface relies on an uncleaved C-terminal secretion signal. In this report, we identify two genes encoding components of the RsaA secretion apparatus. These components are part of a type I secretion system involving an ABC transporter protein. These genes, lying immediately 3' of rsaA, were found by screening a Tn5 transposon library for the loss of RsaA transport and characterizing the transposon-interrupted genes. The two proteins presumably encoded by these genes were found to have significant sequence similarity to ABC transporter and membrane fusion proteins of other type I secretion systems. The greatest sequence similarity was found to the alkaline protease (AprA) transport system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the metalloprotease (PrtB) transport system of Erwinia chrysanthemi. The prtB and aprA genes were introduced into C. crescentus, and their products were secreted by the RsaA transport system. Further, defects in the S-layer protein transport system led to the loss of this heterologous secretion. This is the first report of an S-layer protein secreted by a type I secretion apparatus. Unlike other type I secretion systems, the RsaA transport system secretes large amounts of its substrate protein (it is estimated that RsaA accounts for 10 to 12% of the total cell protein). Such levels are expected for bacterial S-layer proteins but are higher than for any other known type I secretion system.

This work provides strong evidence for oxidative stress in the PF of women with endometriosis. 1) The low density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated from the PF of subjects with endometriosis shows a small but detectable increase in electrophoretic mobility compatible with mildly oxidized LDL compared with LDL isolated from the plasma of the same subjects and PF of controls. 2) Isolated PF-LDL of endometriosis subjects is more readily oxidized in vitro than PF-LDL of controls, or LDL isolated from plasma. 3) Vitamin E content is significantly lower in endometriosis PF compared with controls, and compared with plasma of women with endometriosis and controls. No difference is seen between plasma and PF of control subjects. 4) The ratio of phosphatidylcholine/lyso phosphatidylcholine (Ptd/lyso PtdCho) in the PF of endometriosis subjects is significantly lower compared with PF of controls. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence for a pro-oxidant environment in the peritoneal cavity of women with endometriosis. Lyso PtdCho, a product derived from phospholipase A2 action on peroxidized phosphatidylcholine and a potent chemotactic factor for monocytes and T-lymphocytes, is elevated in endometriosis. We hypothesize that the increased presence of lipid peroxidation products in the PF of endometriosis subjects may, at least partly, account for the recruitment of leukocytes, the increase in macrophage activation, the secretion of monocyte--macrophage-derived cytokines, and the endometrial growth-promoting activity associated with endometriosis.

TI  - Induction of primary immune responses by allogeneic human myoblasts: dissection of the cell types required for proliferation, IFNgamma secretion and cytotoxicity.  
AB  - Non-professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) have a limited ability to activate T lymphocytes during normal and auto-immune responses. Myoblasts could play an important role as APC in the etiology of autoimmune myasthenia gravis and polymyositis, as well as during muscle graft rejection. We examined the role of different component cell subsets in the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to allogeneic myoblasts. Treatment of myoblasts with TNFalpha or IFNgamma led to the expression of a range of immunostimulatory molecules including MHC class I and II, and CD95 (Fas), but not B7 family molecules. Whole PBMC, cultured with allogeneic myoblasts, proliferated, secreted IFNgamma, and were cytotoxic. Proliferation and IFNgamma secretion were largely dependent on the presence of CD4+ lymphocytes, but neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells were responsible for cytotoxicity, which was mediated by MHC class II+ non-T mononuclear cells. However, purified CD4+ lymphocytes co-cultured with allogeneic myoblasts required co-stimulation with anti-CD28 antibodies for proliferation and IFNgamma secretion, which only induced a low level of IFNgamma secretion by CD8+ lymphocytes and did not induce cytotoxic function. These results suggest that human myoblasts can act as antigen-presenting cells for naive T lymphocytes, but only with additional co-stimulation.

TI  - Interleukin-1beta regulates pituitary follistatin and inhibin/activin betaB mRNA levels and attenuates FSH secretion in response to activin-A.  
AB  - Activins and follistatins regulate all levels of the reproductive axis, including the pituitary where they stimulate and inhibit FSH production, respectively. Gonadotropes are known to express inhibin/activin betaB and activin-B (betaBbetaB) functions as an autocrine modulator of FSH production. By contrast, the mRNA for the activin-binding protein, follistatin, is present in most pituitary cells and folliculo-stellate cells may be the major source of the protein secreted by the anterior pituitary. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is one of several cytokines known to also influence the reproductive axis. IL-1beta inhibits the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis by suppressing GnRH and gonadal steroid production. Because several pituitary cell types, including follistatin-producing folliculo-stellate cells, are targets of IL-1beta, cytokine effects on gonadotrope function were evaluated using cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Activin-A (0.01 to 1 nM; 24h) increased basal FSH secretion approximately 2-fold. IL-1beta (0.005 to 0.5 nM) by itself had no effect on basal FSH secretion. However, IL-1beta attenuated FSH secretion in response to all concentrations of activin-A. These results suggest that the cytokine might stimulate the local production of a factor, such as follistatin, that antagonizes the action of activin-A. RNase protection analysis indicated that IL-1beta (0.005 to 5 nM) stimulated follistatin and inhibin/activin betaB mRNA accumulation in a time-dependent manner. These in vitro effects of IL-1beta were blocked by the specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) and were not mimicked by either rhIL-6 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment of intact male rats with LPS (50 microg, i.v.), which increases plasma IL-1beta and induces IL-1beta expression in many tissues, including the pituitary, produced similar time-dependent increases in pituitary follistatin and inhibin/activin subunit mRNA levels. These results suggest that IL-1beta can modulate gonadotrope responses to activins by influencing the local balance of activin-B and follistatin within the pituitary.

TI  - Protein translocation into host epithelial cells by infecting enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.  
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) causes diarrhoea in young children. EPEC induces the formation of actin pedestal in infected epithelial cells. A type III protein secretion system and several proteins that are secreted by this system, including EspB, are involved in inducing the formation of the actin pedestals. We have demonstrated that contact of EPEC with HeLa cells is associated with the induction of production and secretion of EspB. Shortly after infection, EPEC initiates translocation of EspB, and EspB fused to the CyaA reporter protein (EspB-CyaA), into the host cell. The translocated EspB was distributed between the membrane and the cytoplasm of the host cell. Translocation was strongly promoted by attachment of EPEC to the host cell, and both attachment factors of EPEC, intimin and the bundle-forming pili, were needed for full translocation efficiency. Translocation and secretion of EspB and EspB-CyaA were abolished in mutants deficient in components of the type III protein secretion system, including sepA and sepB mutants. EspB-CyaA was secreted but not translocated by an espB mutant. These results indicate that EspB is both translocated and required for protein translocation by EPEC.

TI  - Growth hormone- and testosterone-dependent regulation of glutathione transferase subunit A5 in rat liver.  
AB  - The class Alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) subunit A5 is expressed in the livers of young male and female rats. After sexual maturation, this protein is no longer detectable in the livers of male rats, but is still expressed in female rats. We have previously demonstrated that the sexually dimorphic secretion of growth hormone regulates the levels of certain class Mu GSTs in rat liver, and this study was designed to investigate the hormonal regulation of GSTA5. Control and hypophysectomized rats of both sexes were used to study the role of growth hormone in the regulation of hepatic GSTA5; and the influence of testosterone on the expression of this same subunit was investigated in intact females and castrated males. Liver cytosols were subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies directed towards rat (r)GSTA5, and to affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose followed by reverse-phase HPLC in order to quantify the relative levels of rGSTA1, A2, A3, A4, M1 and M2 subunits. These analyses revealed that the expression of rGSTA5 is, indeed, regulated by both growth hormone and testosterone.

TI  - Inhibition of LPL expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages is dependent on LDL oxidation state: a key role for lysophosphatidylcholine.  
AB  - The regulation of macrophage lipoprotein lipase (LPL) secretion and mRNA expression by atherogenic lipoproteins is of critical relevance to foam cell formation. LPL is present in arterial lesions and constitutes a bridging ligand between lipoproteins, proteoglycans, and cell receptors, thus favoring macrophage lipoprotein uptake and lipid accumulation. We investigated the effects of native and of oxidized lipoproteins on the expression of LPL in an in vitro human monocyte-macrophage system. Exposure of mature macrophages (day 12) to highly copper-oxidized human low density lipoprotein (LDL) (100 microg protein per milliliter) led to marked reduction in the expression of LPL activity (-62%, P<0.01) and mRNA level (-47%, P<0.05); native LDL, acetylated LDL, and LDL oxidized for <6 hours were without effect. The reduction in LPL activity became significant at a threshold of 6 hours of LDL oxidation (-31%, P<0.05). Among the biologically active sterols formed during LDL oxidation, only 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (5 microg/mL) induced a minor reduction in macrophage LPL activity, whereas 25-hydroxycholesterol was without effect. By contrast, lysophosphatidylcholine, whose LDL content increased in parallel with the degree of oxidation, induced significant reductions in LPL activity and mRNA levels at concentrations of 2 to 20 micromol/L (-34% to -53%, P<0.01). Our results demonstrate that highly oxidized LDL (>6-hour oxidation) exerts negative feedback on LPL secretion in human monocytes-macrophages via a reduction in mRNA levels. By contrast, native LDL and mildly oxidized LDL (<6-hour oxidation) did not exert a feedback effect on LPL expression. We speculate that the content of lysophosphatidylcholine and, to a lesser degree, of 7beta-hydroxycholesterol in oxidized LDLs is responsible for the downregulation of LPL activity and mRNA abundance in human monocyte-derived macrophages and may therefore modulate LPL-mediated pathways of lipoprotein uptake during conversion of macrophages to foam cells.

TI  - Enhanced analgesia and suppression of plasma beta-endorphin by the S(+)-isomer of ibuprofen.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nociceptive barrage after tissue injury results in acute pain and a variety of physiologic responses, including pituitary secretion of beta-endorphin. This study evaluated whether administration of the pharmacologically active S(+)-isomer of ibuprofen suppresses acute pain and plasma beta-endorphin levels in the oral surgery model of acute pain. METHODS: Subjects in a single-dose, double-blind, parallel-group study received either 200 mg S(+)-ibuprofen, 400 mg S(+)-ibuprofen, 400 mg racemic ibuprofen, or placebo. Both doses of S(+)-ibuprofen resulted in significantly greater analgesia over the first 60 minutes in comparison to racemic ibuprofen and placebo; the 400 mg dose of S(+)-ibuprofen also produced greater analgesia at 2 and 3 hours. Plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-endorphin decreased over time coincident with the onset of analgesia in all groups but were significantly less than placebo after both doses of S(+)-ibuprofen from 30 to 120 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that, compared with racemic ibuprofen, administration of the S(+)-isomer of ibuprofen results in faster analgesic onset, greater peak analgesia, similar duration of action, and a low incidence of adverse effects, while suppressing nociceptive activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis.

TI  - A novel organ culture method to study the function of human odontoblasts in vitro: gelatinase expression by odontoblasts is differentially regulated by TGF-beta1.  
AB  - Odontoblasts cannot be cultured by traditional cell culture methods, thus restricting in vitro studies. Here we present an organ culture method for human odonto-blasts that utilizes the pulp chamber as a culture crucible. Crowns of human third molars were dissected, pulp was gently removed, and the odontoblasts attached to and in the walls of the pulp chambers were cultured in serum-free OPTI-MEM medium, or DMEM/Ham's F12 medium containing 10% serum. Pulp tissues were cultured separately. Cell content and morphology were analyzed by SEM, and the removed pulps were examined by light microscopy. Proteins secreted into the medium with or without TGF-beta1 supplementation were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the total protein content was assessed by TCA precipitation and SDS-PAGE/fluorography. To assess the role of gelatinolytic enzymes on dentin matrix remodeling, we used enzymography to analyze the effect of TGF-beta1 on gelatinase A and B expression. SEM revealed odontoblasts in pulp chambers after 5 days of culture, with only few or no fibroblasts, and no alterations in the odontoblast cell morphology or differences between the cells cultured in serum-free and serum-containing media. Rarely were any odontoblasts present in pulp tissue. Radiolabeling revealed protein synthesis and secretion until day 6 in both the odontoblast and pulp cultures, with no marked differences between TGF-beta1-treated and control cultures. The level of gelatinase A remained constant up to 7 days, while gelatinase B expression was always low and decreased with time in culture. However, gelatinase B levels were markedly increased upon TGF-beta1 treatment of cells and remained high to day 7. The results suggest that this method provides a novel technique for the study of human odontoblasts in vitro and that odontoblasts can be cultured even in serum-free conditions.

TI  - Correlation between IL-12 and IL-2 blood levels in the metastatic neoplastic disease: a possible inhibitory feedback system regulating their secretion.  
AB  - Despite the great importance of IL-2 and IL-12 in activating the anticancer immune response in humans, cancer-related physiopathology of their secretion needs to be better investigated. IL-2 blood levels have been proven to decrease in the advanced neoplastic disease, whereas preliminary data would suggest an enhanced secretion of IL-12 in metastatic cancer patients. This study was performed to analyze IL-2 levels in relation to those of IL-12 in metastatic solid neoplasms. The study included 40 untreated metastatic cancer patients. Serum levels of both IL-2 and IL-12 were measured by ELISA. Abnormally low blood levels of IL-2 and elevated values of IL-12 were observed in 16/40 and in 18/40 patients, respectively. Moreover, patients with IL-2 deficiency showed significantly higher mean levels of IL-12 than patients with normal values of IL-2. This preliminary result, by showing an increased secretion of IL-12 in advanced cancer patients with IL-2 endogenous deficiency, would suggest the existance of a possible feedback mechanism operating between macrophage release of IL-12 and T lymphocyte secretion of IL-2.

TI  - Handling of doxorubicin by the LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cell line.  
AB  - The characteristics of doxorubicin handling have been studied in the cultured kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1, which has structure and function similar to those of renal tubular cells and expresses P-glycoprotein. The uptake of doxorubicin by LLC-PK1 cells was time dependent, reaching a steady state at about 4 hr, and reduced at low temperature; the initial uptake was saturable. The efflux of doxorubicin from LLC-PK1 cells was also temperature dependent but, even at 37 degrees C, a significant percentage of the drug remained associated with the cells after 180 min, which suggests a strong cellular binding, and the fluorescence microscopy revealed that the drug was concentrated in intracellular organelles. Substances that are substrates for P-glycoprotein, such as verapamil, vinblastine, vincristine and quinidine, significantly increased doxorubicin concentrations in LLC-PK1 cells. Similar results were obtained with the metabolic inhibitors sodium metavanadate and 2,4-dinitrophenol. On the other hand, the uptake was not affected by the classic organic cation transport drugs cimetidine, decynium 22 or decynium 24, nor by the organic anion drug probenecid. These results indicate that, in LLC-PK1 cells, doxorubicin enters by passive diffusion, is trapped in intracellular organelles and then is extruded from cells by a mechanism that probably involves P-glycoprotein. On the contrary, substances that interfere with the renal organic cation or anion secretory system have no effect on doxorubicin net accumulation in these cells.

TI  - PKC isoforms and other signaling proteins involved in surfactant secretion in developing rat type II cells.  
AB  - We previously reported that there is a developmental increase in surfactant secretion in response to P2Y2 purinoceptor agonists. UTP does not stimulate secretion in type II cells from 1- or 2-day-old rats; there is a small response to UTP in cells from 4-day-old animals, and the response increases with increasing age thereafter. Second messenger formation in response to P2Y2 agonists has a similar developmental pattern. We have investigated whether the failure to respond to P2Y2 agonists is due to a deficiency in the P2Y2 receptor or in downstream signaling factors. We compared type II cells from adult and 1- to 2-day-old rats with respect to expression of the P2Y2 receptor gene and the levels of phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) and protein kinase C (PKC) isomers and of the alpha-subunit of the GTP-binding protein Gq. We measured gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by immunoblotting. We identified PKC-alpha, -betaI, -betaII, -delta, -eta, -zeta, -theta, and -mu, PLC-beta3, and Gqalpha in adult and newborn type II cells. PKC-epsilon, -gamma, and -lambda and PLC-beta1, -beta2, and -beta4 were not present in adult or newborn type II cells. Expression of the P2Y2 receptor gene was essentially the same in newborn and adult cells. However, the levels of PKC-alpha, -betaI, -betaII, and -zeta in newborn type II cells were only 43-57% those of adult cells. The level of PKC-theta also tended to be lower in the newborn cells. There was little difference between newborn and adult type II cells in the levels of PKC-delta, -eta, and -mu, PLC-beta3, and Gqalpha. These data suggest that the lack of response of early newborn type II cells to P2Y2 agonists is not due to a lack of expression of the receptor gene but possibly to insufficient amounts of one or more of the alpha, betaI, betaII, or zeta PKC isoforms.

TI  - Presenilin-1 mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease do not disrupt protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.  
AB  - Mutations in genes encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) have been linked to familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells expressing mutant presenilins produce elevated levels of Abeta42, the major amyloid peptide found in AD plaques. The mechanism whereby this occurs remains unknown, but the localization of presenilins to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments has suggested that they may function in intracellular trafficking pathways involved in processing beta-amyloid precursor proteins (APP). To test this possibility, we coexpressed PS1(wt), PS1(M146L), or PS1(L286V) in HEK293 cells together with the LDL receptor, a classic glycoprotein marker that undergoes post-translational O-glycosylation in the Golgi compartment. Pulse-chase analysis of the receptor indicated that mutant presenilins had no effect on ER-->Golgi transport. Similar results were obtained when the studies were carried out with cells expressing the Swedish variant of APP (SWAPP751) instead of the LDL receptor. Moreover, secretion of the soluble exodomain polypeptide fragments of SWAPP751 that arise from alpha-secretase and beta-secretase cleavage was not markedly affected by the PS1 mutants. Despite the lack of discernible effect of the PS1 mutants on trafficking of proteins through the Golgi apparatus, they caused a substantial increase in the proportion of Abeta42 relative to total Abeta in the culture medium. The results suggest that mutant forms of PS1 cause elevated production of Abeta42 by a mechanism that is independent of a major disruption of exocytic trafficking of APP.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of human mononuclear cells to produce factors that cause catecholamine secretion from adrenomedullary chromaffin cells; to determine conditions that stimulate mononuclear cells to produce such factors; and to compare these results with catecholamine secretion in response to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-2. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, prospective study using in vitro conditions. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Human mononuclear cells and porcine chromaffin cells. INTERVENTIONS: Circulating human mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured overnight in RPMI media. Cell-free media from these cultures (conditioned media) were then tested for the ability to cause epinephrine secretion from porcine chromaffin cells. Mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin or by mixing cells from two different individuals while suppression was tested with dexamethasone. Catecholamine secretion in response to IL-1 and IL-2 (50 and 500 units/well, respectively), or nicotinic agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (10 microM, which mimics the action of acetylcholine), was tested for comparison. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Isolated porcine chromaffin cells had stable catecholamine content at the time of secretion measurements, and catecholamine release from cells into the media was measured using electrochemical detection after high-performance liquid chromatography separation. Catecholamine secretion was expressed as a percentage of the total cellular content. Epinephrine secretion due to human conditioned media was 6.9 +/- 1.0% compared with 1.4 +/- 0.6% for control media (p < .05) and 14.6 +/- 3.3% for dimethylphenylpiperazinium (p < .05). Epinephrine secretion with conditioned media from mixed cells (mixed leukocyte reaction) was 16.6 +/- 1.2%, which was higher than the epinephrine secretion caused by media from a single donor (6.9% +/- 1.0, p < .001). Pretreatment with dexamethasone inhibited the formation of bioactive products from mixed mononuclear cell preparations. Cytokines IL-1 and IL-2 did not stimulate chromaffin cell epinephrine secretion above background release with control media incubation. In all cases, norepinephrine secretion was similar to that of epinephrine, and results are included in all figures. CONCLUSIONS: Factors released from human immune cells can mediate epinephrine and norepinephrine release from adrenomedullary cells through a nonneural mechanism. Such immune cell factor release can be modulated by immunostimulation and steroid suppression. Release of such factors in vivo may contribute to increased circulating epinephrine in response to infectious challenge and may be an important factor in the critically ill patient.

TI  - The time course of follicle-stimulating hormone suppression by recombinant human inhibin A in the adult male rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta).  
AB  - In higher primates, FSH secretion appears to be regulated by a control system consistent with that described by the classical inhibin hypothesis. The purpose of the present experiment was to examine the time course of inhibin's action to suppress FSH secretion in the intact adult male rhesus monkey. To this end, five adult males implanted with indwelling venous catheters and exhibiting typical episodic patterns of LH and testosterone (T) secretion received a 4-day i.v. infusion of recombinant human (rh) inhibin A (832 ng/h x kg) followed, after a 4-week interval, by vehicle infusion of similar duration. Changes in circulating FSH concentrations during the inhibin and vehicle infusions were determined using a sensitive homologous macaque RIA, whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to track inhibin A, inhibin B, and inhibin pro-alpha-C levels during the experiment. Normal pulsatile activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis was confirmed by monitoring changes in circulating concentrations of LH and T in 12-h windows of sequential blood collection (1200-2400 h; every 20 min) before, during, and after the rh inhibin A and vehicle infusions. Although infusion of rh inhibin A, which led to a 12 ng/ml square wave increment in circulating levels of this inhibin dimer, produced a marked decline in circulating FSH concentrations, significant suppression of the secretion of this gonadotropin was not manifest until 54 h after initiation of the infusion. Despite the marked decline in FSH secretion during the last 24 h of the 4-day infusion of recombinant hormone, circulating inhibin B and pro-alpha-C concentrations were maintained at preinfusion control levels (1 ng/ml). The finding that imposition of an exaggerated circulating inhibin signal led to suppression of FSH secretion in the male monkey only after 2 days of exposure to the hormone indicates that in this species the feedback action of testicular inhibin on FSH secretion is heavily lagged. Moreover, as the decrease in FSH did not lead to changes in native inhibin secretion, it seems reasonable to propose that the FSH-inhibin feedback loop that governs testicular function in higher primates operates with considerable hysteresis at both the pituitary and gonadal levels. The failure of dramatically elevated inhibin A levels to influence the pulsatile secretion of LH in the monkey reinforces the idea that in this species the pituitary action of testicular inhibin is specific for FSH and does not involve modulation of GnRH receptor levels.

TI  - Prostaglandin E2 in the salivary glands of the female tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.): calcium mobilization and exocytosis.  
AB  - A cholera toxin-sensitive, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) specific receptor has been identified in the plasma membrane fraction of tick salivary glands. In the present study, we report that stimulation of dispersed salivary glands of the lone star tick Amblyomma americanum (L.) with 1 nM to 10 microM PGE2 increased the intracellular concentration of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation of dispersed tissue with 1 nM to 10 microM PGE2 also stimulated release of 45Ca2+ from preloaded tissue. PGE2 (10 microM) did not stimulate an influx of 45Ca2+. Therefore, the PGE2 receptor in the salivary glands appears to activate a phosphoinositide phospholipase C signalling pathway to increase formation of intracellular IP3 and, thus, mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Incubation of dispersed salivary glands with 1 nM to 1 microM PGE2 stimulated secretion of anticoagulant protein, but not at < 1 nM or > 1 microM PGE2. In addition, the mammalian PGE2 EP1 receptor antagonist AH-6809 affected secretion of anticoagulant by dispersed salivary gland tissue at a low concentration supporting the hypothesis that the PGE2 receptor in tick salivary glands is EP1-like. We propose that a major function for PGE2 in tick salivary glands is to mobilize Ca2+ and stimulate secretion (exocytosis) of bioactive proteins into the tick's saliva during feeding.

TI  - Effect of exogenous progesterone on luteinizing hormone secretion in domestic turkey hens at different reproductive states.  
AB  - To determine effects of progesterone (P4) treatment on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in turkey hens, two trials were conducted. Trial 1 was to determine changes in LH, P4, and testosterone (T) during photostimulation. Photosensitive turkey hens were maintained under short days (SD) of 6 h light and 18 h dark. At the beginning of Trial 1, blood samples were taken daily for 4 days, then one-half of the hens were switched to long days (LD) of 14 h light and 10 h dark, and daily blood samples were continued until 5 days after eggs were laid by all the hens switched to LD. Concentrations of LH, P4, and T increased significantly 1 day after switching hens from SD to LD, but the increase in P4 was initially low with a further increase occurring by 3 days prior to first eggs. In Trial 2, turkey hens were injected with exogenous P4 to determine if P4 is an initiator of the preovulatory surge of LH. P4 or vehicle were injected im in hens at three different reproductive states: (1) while hens were maintained under SD, (2) on the 5th day after hens were switched from SD to LD, and (3) after hens were laying for 1 week. The hens were serially bled at 10-min intervals for 8 h to monitor changes in LH and P4. After 2 h of serial bleeding, P4 or vehicle was injected and bleeding was continued for an additional 6 h. After P4 injection, its concentration increased rapidly from a base level of 0.25-1.20 ng/ml to a postinjection high level of 4.42-6.10 ng/ml within 20 min. The high level of P4 was then maintained throughout the remaining 6 h. No increases of LH secretion were observed after P4 or vehicle injection in hens at either State 1 or State 2. Small increases of LH secretion were detected about 2 h after P4 injection in hens at State 3, but these increases were not significantly above vehicle-injected controls. Thus, there was no positive feedback effect of P4 injection on LH secretion in this trial. These results suggest that P4 might not induce LH secretion in immature or mature turkey hens and might not be the factor which induces the preovulatory surge of LH in laying turkey hens. Nonsteroidal factors of ovarian origin might be involved in regulating the preovulatory surge of LH in turkey hens. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a partial agonist of D2 dopaminergic receptors and it potentiates dopamine-mediated prolactin secretion in lactotrophs in vitro.  
AB  - The hallucinogenic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have mainly been attributed to the interaction of this drug with the serotoninergic system, but it seems more likely that they are the result of the complex interactions of the drug with both the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional actions of LSD at dopaminergic receptors using prolactin secretion by primary cultures of rat pituitary cells as a model. LSD produced a dose-dependent inhibition of prolactin secretion in vitro with an IC50 at 1.7x10(-9) M. This action was antagonized by spiperone but not by SKF83566 or cyproheptadine, which indicates that LSD has a specific effect on D2 dopaminergic receptors. The maximum inhibition of prolactin secretion achieved by LSD was lower than that by dopamine (60% versus 80%). Moreover, the fact that LSD at 10(-8)-10(-6) M antagonized the inhibitory effect of dopamine (10(-7) M) and bromocriptine (10(-11) M) suggests that LSD acts as a partial agonist at D2 receptors on lactotrophs in vitro. Interestingly, LSD at 10(-13)-10(-10) M, the concentrations which are 10-1000-fold lower than those required to induce direct inhibition on pituitary prolactin secretion, potentiated the dopamine (10(-10)-2.5x10(-9) M)-mediated prolactin secretion by pituitary cells in vitro. These results suggest that LSD not only interacts with dopaminergic receptors but also has a unique capacity for modulating dopaminergic transmission. These findings may offer new insights into the hallucinogenic effect of LSD.

TI  - Imidazoles suppress rat testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid formation In vivo.  
AB  - The aim of these studies was to examine the effects of imidazoles on testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) formation through measurement of serum LH, serum testosterone, TIF testosterone, and TIF volumes. Imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), and ketoconazole, an oral imidazole antifungal agent, caused dose-dependent decreases in testosterone secretion and TIF formation. Imidazole, 2-methylimidazole, and 4-MI decreased LH secretion. 4-MI decreased testosterone secretion 1-6 h after injection, increased testosterone at 8-16 h, decreased LH secretion at 4 h, decreased TIF volumes at 1-8 h, and slightly increased TIF volumes at 24 h. 4-MI blocked the stimulatory effects of hCG on testosterone secretion and prevented an expected increase in LH secretion after the 4-MI-induced decrease in testosterone secretion. 4-MI also reversed the effects of three other stimulants of testosterone secretion that presumably act through three different testicular regulatory systems: N-methyl-D,L-aspartate, an excitatory amino acid; NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. These results support the hypothesis that imidazoles inhibit testicular function and male reproductive function through inhibition of testosterone secretion, TIF formation, and LH secretion regulatory systems.

TI  - Human endothelial cell storage granules: a novel intracellular site for isoforms of the endothelin-converting enzyme.  
AB  - We have previously shown endothelin (ET)-like immunoreactive staining in Weibel-Palade bodies, storage granules that are an integral component of the regulated secretory pathway in endothelial cells. These structures degranulate after chemical or mechanical stimuli that result in cytosolic calcium influx. We therefore investigated whether the regulated pathway might be an intracellular site involved in the cleavage of big ET-1 to the biologically active peptide ET-1 by determining the ultrastructural localization of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1. A low level of ECE-like immunoreactivity was detected on the cell surface of human umbilical vein and coronary artery endothelial cells by scanning electron microscopy. Exogenous big ET-1 was added to permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and ECE activity was measured by the detection of ET-like immunoreactivity in the culture supernatant. A marked increase in ECE activity was observed in permeabilized cells, indicating that ECE may also be expressed in intracellular compartments. Confocal microscopy revealed intense immunofluorescence staining for big ET-1 and the 2 isoforms of ECE-1 (ECE-1alpha and ECE-1beta) in the perinuclear region and in Weibel-Palade bodies of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Stimulated degranulation of storage granules by the calcium ionophore A23187 caused release of ET into the culture supernatants. The findings of this study indicate that big ET-1 is processed to the mature vasoactive peptide by ECEs located within endothelial storage granules. We hypothesize that this activity may be important in the regulated mobilization of ET in human endothelial cells.

TI  - [Changes in systemic and local immunity in patients with acute and chronic purulent sinusitis in response to regional lymphotropic immunostimulating therapy]  
AB  - We studied the effects of regional lymphotropic immunostimulating therapy on alterations in immunoglobulins levels both in blood serum and paranasal sinuses mucosal secretion in patients with acute and chronic purulent sinusitis. Solutions of tactivin, lidase and novocain were administered into the area of the submaxillary lymph nodes. The effect was compared to that obtained after subcutaneous administration of tactivin and conventional therapy. No reliable alterations in systemic humoral immunity in response to lymphotropic immunostimulating therapy was reported in acute sinusitis, while in chronic sinusitis an increase in initially low IgA occurred. Regional lymphotropic administration of tactivin promoted a pronounced decrease in the initially elevated levels of SIgA, IgA and IgG in the secretion of paranasal mucosa in acute purulent sinusitis, and an increase of basaline lowered SIgA, a fall in the IgG concentration in chronic purulent sinusitis. This is indicative of effectiveness of this method of immunostimulator administration on local immunological reactivity of the mucous membrane.

TI  - A limited renal injury may cause a permanent form of neurogenic hypertension.  
AB  - Previously, we have shown that an acute injury to the kidney produced by an intrarenal injection of phenol causes an immediate increase in blood pressure and in norepinephrine (NE) secretion from the posterior hypothalamus. The studies suggest that in this model afferent impulses from the kidney to central integrative structures in the brain may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure. To further evaluate whether a renal injury caused by the intrarenal injection of phenol leads to a permanent elevation of blood pressure and whether this is mediated by increased sympathetic nervous system activity, we examined the chronic effects (4 weeks) of an intrarenal injection of 50 microL of 10% phenol on blood pressure and NE secretion from the posterior hypothalamus. Systolic blood pressure increased from 128 +/- 2.1 to 176 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (P < .01) 4 weeks after receiving the intrarenal injection of phenol, but it did not change in rats that received the vehicle (128 +/- 2.4 and 135 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) and in rats that were subjected to renal denervation (127 +/- 3.4 and 124 +/- 1.0 mm Hg). The secretion of NE from the posterior hypothalamic nuclei was greater (P < .01) in rats that received phenol (253 +/- 9.6 pg/mL) than in controls (158 +/- 8.6 pg/mL) and denervated rats (170 +/- 2.1 pg/mL). These studies have shown that a limited injury to one kidney may cause a permanent elevation of blood pressure and this is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.

TI  - Effect of chronic amylase inhibition on pancreatic growth and acinar cell secretory function in rats.  
AB  - Wheat amylase inhibitor (WAI) was given to growing rats to determine whether chronic inhibition of intraluminal amylase activity alters pancreatic growth, pancreatic enzyme composition, and secretory responsiveness to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) and carbachol. For 21 days 13 rats were fed amylase inhibitor (AI) as 2.72% of the weight of their food; 13 were pair-fed controls (PFC), and 12 were controls with free access to food (FAC). Amylase and lipase secretion was measured from isolated pancreatic acini in response to CCK-OP (10(-12)-10(-8) M) and carbachol (10(-8)-10(-3) M). AI and PFC rats had similar food intakes and weight gains, pancreatic weights, and contents of enzymes (amylase, lipase, trypsin, chymotrypsin), protein, and RNA, but these measurements were significantly reduced compared to those of FAC rats. DNA contents per milligram of pancreas and per gram of body weight and amylase/DNA and trypsin/DNA were similar among all groups. Lipase/DNA and chymotrypsin/DNA in AI rats were the same as in PFC rats but significantly lower than in FAC rats. In response to CCK-OP, amylase secretion was similar in all three groups, but in response to carbachol amylase secretion was significantly less in AI compared to PFC and FAC rats. Lipase secretion increased in response to CCK-OP in AI compared to PFC and FAC rats but was similar in all three groups in response to carbachol. Long-term inhibition of intraluminal amylase activity suppresses pancreatic growth and content of enzymes and RNA by reducing food intake and weight gain and also decreases acinar cell secretion of amylase in response to carbachol and increases lipase secretion in response to CCK-OP.

TI  - Direct actions of gonadal steroid hormones on FSH secretion and expression in the infantile female rat.  
AB  - FSH-beta mRNA is dramatically regulated in the infantile female rat anterior pituitary. Elevated plasma levels of FSH correspond with increased FSH-beta mRNA levels which peak on PND 12. The source of this regulation does not appear to be GnRH, since the administration of a potent GnRH antagonist does not suppress FSH-beta mRNA levels. Consequently, we have examined the effects of the gonadal steroid hormones, estrogen and androgen, on the maintenance of gonadotropin secretion and gene expression both in vivo and in vitro. Androgen and estrogen action was blocked in vivo with the specific receptor antagonists, flutamide (150 microg) and tamoxifen (200 microg). Administration of antagonists during two different three day time-periods of infantile life [postnatal day (PND) 8-11 and PND 11-14] resulted in differing effects on both FSH and LH secretion as well as on FSH-beta and LH-beta mRNA levels. Flutamide and tamoxifen treatment both suppressed FSH secretion at either age examined (p < 0.01). LH secretion was suppressed by both treatments but only at the younger of the two ages (p < 0.01). In contrast to its effects on FSH secretion, tamoxifen suppressed FSH-beta mRNA levels in the later group only. LH-beta mRNA levels were suppressed by tamoxifen, but only in the younger age group (p < 0.05). The direct effects of steroid hormones on infantile pituitary gonadotrophs were examined in vitro by incubating cells with dihydrotestosterone propionate (DHTP; 10(-8) M) or 17beta-estradiol (E; 10(-8) M). Both DHT and E treatment stimulated FSH secretion when measured 48 h later (p < 0.01). There were no effects on LH secretion. FSH-beta mRNA levels were also stimulated by DHT at 48 h (p < 0.01). Estradiol treatment transiently increased FSH-beta mRNA levels at 2 and 6 h following treatment (p < 0.01) but not at 48 h. LH-beta levels were suppressed by DHT treatment (p < 0.05), and E transiently elevated LH-beta mRNA levels at 2 h (p < 0.05). Taken together these studies indicate that gonadotrophs from infantile female rats are capable of responding directly to steroid hormones, and may play a role in the selective stimulation of FSH secretion and expression in vivo.

TI  - Enhancement of long-term testosterone secretion and steroidogenic enzyme expression in human Leydig cells by co-culture with human Sertoli cell-enriched preparations.  
AB  - We have shown previously that long-term testosterone secretion, which decreases when human Leydig cells are cultured alone, increases when purified human Leydig and Sertoli cells are cultured together. In this work, human Leydig cell functions were studied further during in vitro culture, either alone or with human Sertoli cells, on a basal membrane derived from bovine corneal endothelial cells. The secretion of testosterone increased during the first week of co-culture and remained elevated up to day 12 of culture. In one prolonged co-culture, testosterone secretion decreased progressively after day 12 and, after 1 month of culture, was at a level similar to that observed during the first 48 h. After culture for 48 h, testosterone secretion in the co-culture was enhanced by 162 +/- 5% (p < 0.0001) compared with values observed when Leydig cells were cultured alone (42.6 +/- 10.6 ng/10(6) Leydig cells/48 h; mean +/- SEM). This change was associated with increase in mRNA levels for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (2.49 +/- 0.58-fold), cytochrome P450c17 (2.81 +/- 0.99-fold), cytochrome P450scc (5.20 +/- 0.13-fold) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (1.73 +/- 0.21-fold) when Leydig cells were co-cultured with Sertoli cells (p < 0.05 for each enzyme). IGF-I mRNA levels were higher (2.77 +/- 0.72-fold for 7.6 kb and 1.41 +/- 0.07-fold for 1.1-1.3 kb transcripts) in the Leydig-Sertoli cell co-cultures than the sum of the levels in Leydig and in Sertoli cells cultured alone. Both basal and hCG-induced testosterone secretion were enhanced by treatment of the co-culture with human recombinant FSH (50 mIU/mL). For basal testosterone secretion, this increase amounted to 163 +/- 5% compared with Leydig cells cultured alone (p < 0.0001) and by 112 +/- 4% compared with non-FSH treated co-cultures (p < 0.01); for hCG-stimulated testosterone secretion this increase was 220 +/- 12% compared with Leydig cells cultured alone (p < 0.0001) and 132 +/- 8% compared with non-FSH treated co-cultures (p < 0.01). This study confirms the enhancement of long-term testosterone secretion by adult human Leydig cells by co-culture with adult human Sertoli cells and shows that this effect is associated with an enhancement of the expression of several steroidogenic enzymes; it might be mediated, as in other species, through increased production of IGF-I by co-culture.

TI  - Potential use of cytokine therapy in poultry.  
AB  - Newly hatched chickens are highly susceptible to infection during the first 2 weeks of life. The utilisation of cytokines as therapeutic agents in livestock animals, in particular poultry, has become more feasible with the recent cloning of cytokine genes and the progression of new technologies such as live vectors. We have constructed a live recombinant fowlpox virus (FPV) that expresses chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (fp/cMGF). Administration of fp/cMGF to chicks resulted in a marked and sustained increase in the number of circulating blood monocytes as well as an increase in their state of activation, as measured by enhanced phagocytic activity and elevated production of nitric oxide. We have recently cloned the gene for chicken interferon-gamma (ChIFN-gamma). Recombinant ChIFN-gamma was capable of protecting chick fibroblasts from undergoing virus-mediated lysis and induced nitrite secretion from chicken macrophages in vitro. Preliminary vaccination trials have indicated that co-administration of ChIFN-gamma with antigen (sheep red blood cells) resulted in enhanced secondary (IgG) antibody responses and allowed a 10-fold lower dose of antigen to be used. Furthermore, administration of ChIFN-gamma resulted in enhanced weight gain in chicks and improved their resistance to disease challenge. The ability of cytokines to combat infection and enhance vaccine efficacy makes them excellent candidates as a therapeutic agents and adjuvants.

TI  - Insulin down-regulates angiotensinogen gene expression and angiotensinogen secretion in cultured adipose cells.  
AB  - Adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensinogen (AT) after liver. Since an association exists between body mass index, hypertension, and insulin-resistance, the role of insulin on the regulation of AT gene expression and AT secretion was examined in cultured Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A adipose cells. Within a physiological range of concentrations (1-17 nM), insulin exerted a negative effect on the abundance of AT mRNA and the secretion of AT. Alterations of insulin-resistance by treatment of adipose cells with TNF-alpha or the thiazolidinedione BRL49653 led respectively to a decrease or an increase in the potency of insulin to down-regulate AT gene expression, whereas maximal inhibition by insulin increased from 30% in TNFalpha-treated cells to 60% in BRL49653-treated cells. These results suggest that a potential link between insulin resistance and high blood pressure may exist by means of increased AT secretion from adipose tissue, especially in obese subjects.

TI  - Absence of photoperiodic modulation of gonadotrophin secretion in HPD rams following chronic pulsatile infusion of GnRH.  
AB  - Hypothalamo-pituitary disconnected Soay rams (HPD rams) were treated chronically with a pulsatile infusion of GnRH (250 ng/2 h) for 10 weeks to reactivate the pituitary-gonadal axis under long days (16L:8D; LD group n=8) and short days (8L:16D, SD group n=8). The aim was to establish whether photoperiod modulates the secretion of gonadotrophins (presumably through the daily melatonin signal) by an action at the level of the pituitary gland. The treatment of the HPD rams with GnRH induced a marked, long-term increase in the peripheral blood concentrations of FSH, LH and testosterone, growth of the testes and reappearance of the androgen-dependent sexual skin colouration. There were parallel changes in the short-term, pulsatile fluctuations in the blood concentrations of LH and FSH, the pituitary responsiveness to GnRH and the testicular responsiveness to a standardized injection of oLH, as observed previously in normal intact rams during reactivation of the reproductive axis induced by a switch from long to short days. There were no significant differences in any of the reproductive parameters between the LD and SD HPD groups, although the blood concentrations of prolactin were significantly higher in the LD group, and GnRH provoked a chronic increase in the blood concentrations of prolactin, particularly in the SD group. Overall, the results support the conclusion that (i) melatonin does not act within the pituitary gland to mediate effects of photoperiod on GnRH-induced gonadotrophin secretion; and (ii) changes in prolactin secretion which result from the local action of melatonin in the pituitary gland do not affect gonadotrophin secretion in the ram.

TI  - Correlation between electrophysiological phenomena and transport of macromolecules in intestinal epithelium.  
AB  - This review discuss some recent findings in the study of the regulation of the permeability of the intestinal epithelial layer. Comparison of electrical phenomena and transport of macromolecules suggests that secretory activity and increased transepithelial transport of macromolecules are related when secretion is mediated by the Ca2+ and PKC dependent pathways. The transport of the macromolecules is via the transcellular and via the paracellular route. The barrier function of the intestinal epithelium may be diminished during nervous (acetylcholine)- and immuno-(histamine) mediated secretion. It is hypothesised that some bacterial toxins may also induce Ca2+ and PKC dependent secretion and thereby can reduce the epithelial barrier. The cAMP and cGMP mediated secretion, which can be recognised by their long-lasting transepithelial potential changes, are not coupled to increased transepithelial transport of macromolecules. Some forms of secretory diarrhea may therefore be related to the development of food-allergy or inflammation.

TI  - Effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and calcium mobilization in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.  
AB  - The effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were studied to evaluate the role of the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in the regulation of a [Ca2+]i-dependent secretory process. These effects were compared with those of nifedipine, a typical voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker. Carbachol produced a rapid increase followed by a sustained increase of [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ transient) in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Both nitroprusside and nicorandil accelerated the decrease in [Ca2+]i without changing the peak values of the initial [Ca2+]i increase of Ca2+ transient. These drugs, however, did not affect carbachol-induced catecholamine secretion, suggesting that secretion is related to the initial [Ca2+]i increase and not to a late sustained [Ca2+]i increases. However, nifedipine reduced the peak and duration of carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i increases and decreased the secretion of catecholamines. Diethylamine/NO complex, an NO donor, and dibutyryl-cGMP produced similar changes in Ca2+ transient and did not alter catecholamine secretion, suggesting that the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil were mediated by the NO/cGMP pathway. These results indicated that the pattern of Ca2+ transient, especially the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, is important in secretion of catecholamine.

TI  - Human cystatin C forms an inactive dimer during intracellular trafficking in transfected CHO cells.  
AB  - To define the cellular processing of human cystatin C as well as to lay the groundwork for investigating its contribution to lcelandic Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis (HCHWA-I), we have characterized the trafficking, secretion, and extracellular fate of human cystatin C in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It is constitutively secreted with an intracellular half-life of 72 min. Gel filtration of cell lysates revealed the presence of three cystatin C immunoreactive species; an 11 kDa species corresponding to monomeric cystatin C, a 33 kDa complex that is most likely dimeric cystatin C and immunoreactive material, > or = 70 kDa, whose composition is unknown. Intracellular monomeric cystatin C is functionally active as a cysteine protease inhibitor, while the dimer is not. Medium from the transfected CHO cells contained only active monomeric cystatin C indicating that the cystatin C dimer, formed during intracellular trafficking, is converted to monomer at or before secretion. Cells in which exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was blocked with brefeldin A contained the 33 kDa species, indicating that cystatin C dimerization occurs in the ER. After removal of brefeldin A, there was a large increase in intracellular monomer suggesting that dimer dissociation occurs later in the secretion pathway, after exiting the ER but prior to release from the cell. Extracellular monomeric cystatin C was found to be internalized into lysosomes where it again dimerized, presumably as a consequence of the low pH of late endosome/lysosomes. As a dimer, cystatin C would be prevented from inhibiting the lysosomal cysteine proteases. These results reveal a novel mechanism, transient dimerization, by which cystatin C is inactivated during the early part of its trafficking through the secretory pathway and then reactivated prior to secretion. Similarly, its uptake by the cell also leads to its redimerization in the lysosomal pathway.

TI  - Attaining dominance in vivo: distinguishing dominant from challenger follicles in humans.  
AB  - This study provides the first report of local suppression of follicle growth in vivo by the dominant follicle in humans. Analyses were focused on antral follicles > or =6 mm in diameter, classified as dominant (ovulatory) and challenger (large, non-ovulatory) follicles. We examined antral follicle characteristics, interactions and location in the ovary in the follicular phase of natural, ovulatory cycles in humans. Individual antral follicles (> or =2 mm) were identified and monitored using a system, developed by the authors, incorporating mapping and computer modelling from ultrasound imaging of the ovary. Results showed that antral follicle development was not restricted to a particular location in the ovary. The apparent randomization of location may provide a developmental advantage for follicles. The population of challenger follicles peaked at mid follicular phase, suggesting a period when the ovarian environment was supportive of larger antral follicle development. As ovulation date approached, however, challenger follicles did not attain the visible characteristics of dominance: mid-level echogenicity, large size, smooth antral wall, round shape. Furthermore, dominant follicles subsequently appeared to reduce the number of neighbouring challenger follicles. The results strongly suggest that a paracrine secretion of the dominant follicle was the source of this localized effect. This process may provide increased nutrient level and space at a critical growth stage for dominant follicles.

TI  - Ovine brain natriuretic peptide in cardiac tissues and plasma: effects of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure on tissue concentration and molecular forms.  
AB  - Whereas numerous studies have examined the cardiac tissue content and secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the response of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in states of experimental cardiac overload is less well documented. Our recent partial cloning of the ovine BNP gene has enabled us to study changes in cardiac tissue concentration, together with tissue and circulating molecular forms of ANP and BNP, in response to cardiac overload induced by rapid ventricular pacing (n = 7) and aortic coarctation (n = 6). In normal sheep, although highest levels of BNP were found in atrial tissue (15-fold those of the ventricle), the BNP/ANP concentration ratio in the ventricles was 10- to 20-fold higher than the ratio calculated for atrial tissue. Compared with normal sheep, significant depletion of both ANP and BNP concentrations within the left ventricle occurred after rapid ventricular pacing. Size exclusion and reverse phase HPLC analysis of atrial and ventricular tissue extracts from normal and overloaded sheep showed a single peak of high molecular weight BNP consistent with the proBNP hormone. In contrast, immunoreactive BNP extracted from plasma drawn from the coronary sinus was all low molecular weight material. Further analysis of plasma BNP using ion exchange HPLC disclosed at least 3 distinct immunoreactive peaks consistent with ovine BNP forms 26-29 amino acid residues in length. These findings show that BNP is stored as the prohormone in sheep cardiac tissues and that complete processing to mature forms occurs at the time of secretion. The capacity to process the prohormone at secretion is not impaired by chronic heart failure.

TI  -  Gonadotropin secretion and development of ovarian follicles during oestrous cycles in heifers treated with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone antagonist.  
AB  - The hypothesis tested was that reduced LHRH stimulation of the anterior pituitary would lead to attenuated development of ovarian follicles as a result of reduced gonadotropin secretion during oestrous cycles of cattle. Twenty heifers were randomly assigned to be treated ( n = 5/treatment) with an antagonist to LHRH (LHRH-Ant) 1) from Day 2 to 7 (Day 0 = behavioural oestrus), 2) Day 7 to 12, 3) Day 12 to 17, 4) or serve as untreated control animals. LHRH-Ant suppressed LH pulses of heifers in all treatment groups from treatment initiation through Day 17 as compared with untreated control heifers [Peters et al., 1994. Luteinizing hormone has a role in development of fully functional corpora lutea (CL) but is not required to maintain CL function in heifers. Biol. Reprod., 51 (1994) 1248-1254]. Circulating concentration of FSH from Day 8 to 10 of the oestrous cycle did not increase in heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 2 to 7 or Day 7 to 12; however, there was increased (P < 0.05) FSH from Day 8 to 10 of the oestrous cycle in heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 12 to 17 and control heifers. Compared with control heifers, heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from the Day 2 to 7 had suppressed (P < 0.05) size and persistence of the first and second dominant ovarian follicles. Heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 7 to 12 had suppressed size (P < 0.05 and tended (P < 0.10) to have a shorter persistence of the second dominant ovarian follicle compared with control heifers. Heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 12 to 17 had a similar (P > 0.10) size and persistence of dominant ovarian follicles but had reduced (P < 0.10) numbers of large follicles compared with control heifers. Heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 2 to 7 had lower (P < 0.01) concentrations of 17 beta-oestradiol during the treatment period and tended (P < 0.10) to have lower concentrations of 17 beta-oestradiol from Day 7 to 12 of the oestrous cycle compared with control heifers. Heifers treated with LHRH-Ant from Day 7 to 12 or Day 12 to 17 had similar (P > 0.10) circulating LH concentrations of l7 beta-oestradiol compared with control heifers. Reduced LHRH stimulation of the pituitary from Day 2 to 12 of the oestrous cycle and the resulting modulation in circulating LH and FSH led to suppressed ovarian follicular development and oestradiol secretion. After Day 12 of the oestrous cycle, reduced LHRH stimulation of the anterior pituitary did not lead to altered ovarian follicular development to the extent as reduced LHRH stimulation before Day 12 although pulsatile release of LH was similarly suppressed by treatment with the LHRH-Ant.

TI  - Increased expression of the secretory Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter with differentiation of a human intestinal cell line.  
AB  - We studied the expression of the secretory Na(+)-K(+)- 2Cl- cotransporter during epithelial differentiation using the clonal human adenocarcinoma cell line HT29-18. Differentiation of HT29-18 cells was accompanied by up to 7-fold increases in cotransporter protein levels, approximately 3-fold increases in cotransporter mRNA levels, and approximately 2.5-fold increases in cotransporter functional expression. No apparent change in cotransporter mRNA stability was observed with differentiation, suggesting that these effects may be due to differences in mRNA transcription rate. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that undifferentiated cells grew in multilayers and exhibited a diffuse, apparently unlocalized membrane labeling by anti-Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter antibody. In contrast, differentiated cells grew in monolayers with strong cotransporter labeling localized to the basal and lateral membranes. Taken together with previous studies demonstrating that expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is also increased following HT29-18 cell differentiation, our results suggest that these cells provide a promising model for studying epithelial differentiation to a Cl- secretory phenotype.

TI  - Simultaneous detection of catecholamine exocytosis and Ca2+ release from single bovine chromaffin cells using a dual microsensor.  
AB  - A dual microsensor with a 5 microns radius was fabricated to detect simultaneously Ca2+ and catecholamines following their secretion from individual biological cells. Detection of Ca2+ was based on changes in fluorescence as a result of its binding with a surface-attached dye, and catecholamines were detected by amperometry. The fluorescent dye employed, calcium green-1 dextran, is a selective chelator for Ca2+. It was attached to the tip of a carbon fiber electrode by cross-linking with 5% glutaraldehyde. The dual microsensor has a subsecond response time for both Ca2+ and catecholamine concentration changes. Ca2+ concentrations of 100 nM can be detected, while the detection limit for catecholamine is in the micromolar range. The utility of the dual microsensor was evaluated at the surface of bovine adrenal medullary cells. Release of catecholamines by exocytosis was evoked by transient application of histamine. This was detected by amperometry, and it was found to be accompanied by Ca2+ release, as measured by fluorescence from the same sensor.

TI  - How do cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations produce lung disease?  
AB  - In recent years, several functions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator have been discovered, yet the pathophysiology of the pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis remains unclear. At the cellular level, functions of this protein include regulation of chloride and sodium transport at the cell membrane and in intracellular organelles, regulation of protein trafficking, and posttranslational processing of glycoconjugates. Elucidation of these functions has led to several hypotheses to account for how defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator produce pulmonary disease, but a clear understanding of the pathophysiologic links between the cellular functions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and organ dysfunction has been hampered by the lack of ideal model systems. Current evidence suggests that defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator lead to alterations in periciliary fluid homeostasis, mucus hydration, mucin secretion, and apical membrane protein structure. In turn, these alterations impair mucociliary clearance and promote bacterial infection, which then leads to chronic airway inflammation and the development of bronchiectasis.
