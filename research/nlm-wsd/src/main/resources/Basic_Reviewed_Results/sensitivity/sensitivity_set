TI  - Mitochondrial DNA deletions associated with aging and presbyacusis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The membrane hypothesis of aging proposes an association between reactive oxygen metabolites and aging processes. Reactive oxygen metabolites are a normal by-product of oxidative phosphorylation and are also formed under conditions of ischemia, hypoperfusion, and as a result of environmental contaminants. Among the many detrimental activities of reactive oxygen metabolites, also known as free oxygen radicals, is direct damage to mitochondrial DNA. Progressive accumulation of mitochondrial DNA damage renders cells unable to conduct oxidative phosphorylation reactions effectively, thereby leading to a bioenergetically deficient cell. Over time, mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates and leads to cellular dysfunction with subsequent organ failure, aging, and ultimately, death. This sequence forms the basis of the membrane hypothesis of aging. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the membrane hypothesis of aging may be involved in the development of presbyacusis. DESIGN: Fischer rats from 4 age groups were tested for auditory sensitivity using the auditory brainstem response. Brain, stria vascularis, and auditory nerve tissues were harvested and mitochondrial DNA was amplified to identify the highly conserved cytochrome b and ND1-16S ribosomal RNA segment of the NADH genes, as well as a 4834-base pair (bp) deletion associated with aging. SUBJECTS: Fischer rats (n=28) from 4 age groups were used: young (2-4 months [n=9]), mid-young (9-11 months [n=5]), mid-old (18-20 months [n=5]), and old (30-34 months [n=9]). RESULTS: The results demonstrate a progressive reduction in auditory sensitivity with age. The mitochondrial DNA studies identify a significant increase in the presence of the 4834-bp deletion in the aged subjects compared with the young. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise the possibility that the 4834-bp deletion may be associated with presbyacusis, as well as with aging.

TI  - Spontaneous activation of ovulated mouse eggs: time-dependent effects on M-phase exit, cortical granule exocytosis, maternal messenger ribonucleic acid recruitment, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate sensitivity.  
AB  - With increasing time after ovulation, mammalian eggs become more sensitive to agonists of activation in vitro or may undergo spontaneous activation in vivo. We have tested the hypothesis that postovulatory eggs undergo time-dependent cell cycle and cytoplasmic changes that result in a partially activated state, accounting for their time-dependent susceptibility to activate. In vivo changes in key activation markers in mouse eggs were quantified at 13, 16, and 22 h post-hCG (1, 4, and 10 h postovulation). Spontaneous activation was first detected at 16 h, with a 20-25% decrease in the activities of histone H1 and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and with 3% of eggs undergoing both anaphase onset and a partial loss of cortical granules. By 22 h, more than 60% of eggs were in anaphase, H1 and MAP kinase activities had decreased 40-50%, the extent of zona pellucida modification had increased, and proteins normally synthesized after fertilization had appeared. Pronuclear formation in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate injection increased dramatically from 10% at 13 h to about 40% and 90% at 16 h and 22 h, respectively. The partial decreases (less than those after fertilization) in H1 and MAP kinase activities provide a likely biochemical basis for the increased sensitivity of eggs to agonists, seen over time, that results in pronuclear formation. Also, all of these time-dependent changes caution against the use of mouse eggs > 16 h after hCG administration in studying the mechanism of normal fertilization and have implications for animal and human in vitro fertilization.

TI  - The inseparable triad: analytical sensitivity, measurement uncertainty, and quantitative resolution [comment] [see comments]  
AB  - The formal definition of sensitivity associates the term with the change in the response of a system for a small change of the stimulus causing the response, i.e., the ratio of the response of a system to the stimulus causing it. One interpretation of sensitivity associates the rate of change of the response for a small change of the stimulus as the slope of a calibration plot of response vs stimulus. An alternative interpretation associates sensitivity with the smallest value of the stimulus that can be resolved with a given degree of confidence, i.e., the detection limit. Applications of the first usage to analytical chemistry date at least to the beginning of this century; applications of the second interpretation are of more recent origin. The accompanying paper argues in favor of the second interpretation on the basis that, among other things, the "slope" interpretation conflicts with the formal definition of sensitivity and is meaningless as a descriptor of the performance of a measuring system. In this paper I offer arguments to support my belief that the slope definition of sensitivity is consistent with both formal definitions and accepted usage in analytical chemistry and, more importantly, that it is an invaluable descriptor of one of the most important characteristics of any analytical method. I include information to support my belief that proper use of the slope definition yields much more information than is available in the "detection limit" interpretation.

TI  - Requirements for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1)-induced permanganate sensitivity of the epstein-barr virus latent origin of DNA replication.  
AB  - Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) activates DNA replication from the Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of DNA replication, oriP. EBNA1 binds cooperatively to four recognition sites in the dyad symmetry (DS) element of oriP, causing alterations in the origin DNA structure, which can be detected by the increased sensitivity of one Thy residue in two of the binding sites to permanganate oxidation. To better understand the significance of this EBNA1-induced origin distortion, we have investigated the DNA sequence and EBNA1 amino acid requirements for permanganate sensitivity. We have shown that the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domains are sufficient to induce permanganate sensitivity and that amino acids 463-467, which form an extended chain that travels along the minor groove of the EBNA1 recognition site, play an important role in generating the DNA distortion. The EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity is independent of cooperative interactions between EBNA1 molecules on the origin and requires a specific sequence within the EBNA1 binding site. Using synthetic EBNA1 binding sites, we found that the inversion of a single AT base pair in the EBNA1 recognition sequence is sufficient to confer EBNA1-induced permanganate sensitivity. These studies indicate that permanganate oxidation can detect very minor alterations in DNA structure.

TI  - Cytokeratin 19 fragment in serum and tissues of patients with pancreatic diseases.  
AB  - CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that increased serum levels of cytokeratin 19 fragment reflect increases in the size of the pancreatic carcinomas, although the sensitivity for detecting small pancreatic carcinomas was low. BACKGROUND: Cytokeratin is a member of the intermediate family of filaments in epithelial cells. The cytokeratin 19 fragment is an acidic cytokeratin, which is found in various epithelial tissues. Recently, the serum fragment of cytokeratin 19 has been measured and found to be a good marker for squamous cell carcinoma. Cytokeratin 19 is known to be expressed in normal pancreatic tissues and pancreatic carcinomas. However, serum cytokeratin 19 levels in pancreatic diseases have not been precisely detailed. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated serum cytokeratin 19 levels and the immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 19 in various pancreatic diseases. RESULTS: Serum cytokeratin 19 levels were high (> 2 ng/mL) in 51 of 99 (52%) cases of pancreatic duct cell carcinoma, but were low in all 24 cases of chronic pancreatitis and in 7 cases of islet cell tumors.  The sensitivity of the cytokeratin 19 assay increased with increased size of the pancreatic carcinomas, but was not influenced by the presence of obstructive jaundice. Immunohistochemical studies using a monoclonal anticytokeratin 19 antibody showed that staining for cytokeratin was positive in all 38 of the pancreatic carcinomas examined and in 2 of 6 islet tumors.

TI  - Comparison between qualitative and quantitative wall motion analyses using dipyridamole stress breath-hold cine magnetic resonance imaging in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis.  
AB  - Breath-hold cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at rest and during dipyridamole infusion was used to study wall motion abnormalities in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis proven by coronary angiography. Sixteen patients without myocardial infarction but at least one major coronary artery with > or = 70% diameter narrowing were included. Qualitative "visual" assessment of wall motion, as well as quantitative measurement "wall thickening changes (%)" were compared using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. 201Tl-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was also studied for comparison. Using qualitative analysis, coronary artery disease detection rate was comparable when assessing wall motion abnormalities with dipyridamole-MRI (79%) and with dipyridamole-induced perfusion defects with 201-thallium-SPECT (75%). Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity for identification of all diseased coronary territories were comparable for both imaging modalities (sensitivity of dipyridamole-MRI and 201thallium-SPECT, 80% vs. 69%; specificity, 75% vs. 80%). The quantitative method has a substantially higher sensitivity than the qualitative method in identifying all diseased territories (Az = 0.81, p < 0.01 vs. Az = 0.55 and 0.59). In addition, we demonstrated that the quantitative method had higher performance than the qualitative one in identifying the diseased vessels territories related to 1-vessel, 2-vessel, and each of individual coronary artery stenoses.

TI  - [The use of spiral computerized tomography in the study of pancreatic insulinoma: preliminary results]  
AB  - Insulinomas are usually benign tumors originating in the pancreatic islets: since they are biologically active tumors, insulinomas present at clinics with hypoglycemia caused by increased insulin production. We examined 7 patients with clinically suspected insulinomas with spiral CT to investigate its capabilities in identifying and characterizing this type of lesion. Four patients had abnormal spiral CT findings (true positives); the diagnosis was confirmed at surgery in 3 patients and at instrumental follow-up in the other. The tumors were 12.2 mm in average diameter. CT showed no tumor mass in 3 cases, which was confirmed at angiography and MRI (true negatives). We observed a typical contrast pattern in 50% of cases, namely a ring-like enhancement changing into homogeneous enhancement. Multiplanar and 3D reconstructions were not necessary for lesion identification, but we used them for regional vascular mapping. In our experience, which is limited to few cases and dose not allow any statistically significant conclusion, spiral CT exhibited high sensitivity in the detection and characterization of pancreatic insulinomas which permits to reduce the resort to more invasive angiographic techniques.

TI  - The peripheral flicker effect: desensitization of the luminance pathway by static and modulated light.  
AB  - Previous studies have shown that luminance flicker, presented peripheral to a foveal test target, increases thresholds for target detection: the peripheral flicker (PF) effect. These studies have also shown that thresholds are elevated more for luminance targets, relative to chromatic targets. In the present study we examined the specificity of the PF effect on the luminance mechanism and assessed the contribution of modulated stray-light to the test field, as well as longer range spatial interactions. We found that the presence of a foveal luminance pedestal, as well as PF, caused a notch to appear in the spectral sensitivity function around 570 nm. This result confirms the hypothesis that the PF effect decreases the sensitivity of the luminance pathway. To assess the contribution of stray-light to the PF effect, we modulated a luminance pedestal without the presence of PF in order to simulate the stray-light effect in isolation. A decrease in sensitivity for wavelengths around 570 nm occurred with modulated stray-light, suggesting that modulated stray-light contributes substantially to this effect. We then minimized the modulated stray-light by phase-reversing a checkerboard pattern in the periphery. A significant, though smaller, threshold elevation to mid-spectrum stimuli was obtained, suggesting that long range spatial effects are also active in the PF effect. We conclude that the PF effect causes a desensitization of foveal luminance pathways via local and more long range spatial interactions. Our results are consistent with previous data which suggest that the PF effect is due to selective adaptation of cells in the magnocellular pathway (M-cells). Our data imply that local network adaptation may be a property of the magnocellular pathway.

TI  - Data mining of inputs: analysing magnitude and functional measures.  
AB  - The problem of data encoding and feature selection for training back-propagation neural networks is well known. The basic principles are to avoid encrypting the underlying structure of the data, and to avoid using irrelevant inputs. This is not easy in the real world, where we often receive data which has been processed by at least one previous user. The data may contain too many instances of some class, and too few instances of other classes. Real data sets often include many irrelevant or redundant input fields. This paper examines the use of weight matrix analysis techniques and functional measures using two real (and hence noisy) data sets. The first part of this paper examines the use of the weight matrix of the trained neural network itself to determine which inputs are significant. A new technique is introduced and compared with two other techniques from the literature. We present our experience and results on some satellite data augmented by a terrain model. The task was to predict the forest supra-type based on the available information. A brute force technique eliminating randomly selected inputs was used to validate our approach. The second part of this paper examines the use of measures to determine the functional contribution of inputs to outputs. Inputs which include minor but unique information to the network are more significant than inputs with higher magnitude contribution but providing redundant information, which is also provided by another input. A comparison is made to sensitivity analysis, where the sensitivity of outputs to input perturbation is used as a measure of the significance of inputs. This paper presents a novel functional analysis of the weight matrix based on a technique developed for determining the behavioral significance of hidden neurons. This is compared with the application of the same technique to the training and test data. Finally, a novel aggregation technique is introduced.

The authors present the case of a patient with Crohn disease relapse with multiple small-bowel fistulae and mesenteric abscesses. Whereas the Tc-99m WBC scan failed to show the intra-abdominal inflammatory foci, an In-111 WBC scan performed within a week delineated the abscesses very well, and these were later confirmed at surgery. This case is presented not only to illustrate the relative sensitivities of a Tc-99m WBC versus an In-111 WBC scan, but also to discuss the impediment to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis by steroids, which may be a contributory factor to the sensitivities of the different radiopharmaceuticals selected for detection of intra-abdominal septic foci.

TI  - Ventilatory response to CO2 in patients with snoring, obstructive hypopnoea and obstructive apnoea.  
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is caused by an obstruction of the upper airway.  Sufficient sensitivity to CO2 in the respiratory centre is known to be a critical factor for adequate tone in the upper airway muscles. The hypothesis of this study is, therefore, that the ventilatory response to CO2 is reduced in patients with OSA. Twenty-six patients who suffered from snoring, 19 snoring patients with obstructive hypopnoea (OH) and 33 snoring patients with obstructive apnoea (OA), were studied. The control group consisted of 25 subjects from a random sample with no history of snoring or daytime sleepiness. Tests of the hyperoxic and hypoxic ventilatory response to CO2 were performed, as well as static and dynamic spirometry. Subjects in the OA group displayed a higher hyperoxic (VE/FetCO2hy = 12.6 l min-1/%) and hypoxic (VE/FetCO2ho = 15.7 l min-1/%) ventilatory response to CO2 than patients with obstructive hypopnoea (VE/FetCO2hy = 8.6 l min-1/%; VE/FetCO2ho = 15.2 l min-1/%), snorers (VE/FetCO2hy = 8.4 l min-1/%; VE/FetCO2ho = 12.7 l min-1/%) and non-snorers (VE/FetCO2hy = 7.6 l min-1/%; VE/FetCOho = 9.6 l min-1/%). Multiple regression analysis reveals that neck circumference, apnoea index, oxygen desaturation index, PCO2 and sex (male gender) are correlated with VE/FetCO2hy (R2 = 0.43). Multiple regression analysis also reveals that ERV (expiratory reserve volume) and sex (male gender) are correlated with VE/FetCO2ho (R2 = 0.21). Arguing against the hypothesis, patients with OSA displayed an increased hyperoxic and hypoxic ventilatory response to CO2. Nocturnal apnoea frequency and the obesity factor in OSA may have contributed to these results.

AB  - We investigated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial distensibility, a marker of biophysical vessel wall properties, in 32 normoalbuminuric type I diabetic patients and 32 healthy control subjects on diets containing 50 mmol and 200 mmol sodium per day. The increase in daytime diastolic blood pressure from 50 to 200 mmol sodium was significantly higher in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects (2.3+/-4.9 versus 0.2+/-3.7 mm Hg, P<.05). On a high sodium regimen, femoral artery distensibility was decreased in the diabetic patients compared with the control subjects (19.2+/-7.6 versus 24.1+/-9.3 10[-3]/kPa, P<.05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in the diabetic patients on a high sodium diet decreased daytime diastolic blood pressure and increased femoral artery distensibility. The blood pressure decrease in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition correlated significantly with the blood pressure increase to sodium (for 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure, r=.72, P<.001 and r=.76, P<.001). In addition, we found that in the diabetic patients on a high sodium diet, the renal blood flow response to exogenous angiotensin II was not bimodally distributed, as is the case in essential hypertension, in which a subgroup of the patients are characterized by sodium sensitivity of the blood pressure and an abnormal renal blood flow response to exogenous angiotensin II ("nonmodulator phenotype"). These results show that blood pressure in insulindependent diabetes mellitus is sodium sensitive, but that this is not related to the nonmodulator phenotype, and suggest that in IDDM a relatively high sodium intake may be a factor that predisposes to the development of diabetic vascular disease.

In this study we examined the possible role of cell-to-cell interactions in the localization processing of a wind stimulus by the cockroach cercal system. Such sensory processing is performed primarily by pairs of giant interneurons (GIs), a group of highly directional cells. We have studied possible interactions among these GIs by comparing the wind sensitivity of a given GI before and after removing another GI with the use of photoablation. Testing various combinations of GI pairs did not reveal any suprathreshold interactions. This was true for all unilateral GI pairs on the left or right side as well as all the bilateral GI pairs (left and right homologues). Those experiments in which we were able to measure synaptic activity did not reveal subthreshold interactions between the GIs either. We conclude that the GIs code independently for a given wind direction without local GI-GI interactions. We discuss the possible implications of the absence of local interactions on information transfer in the first station of the escape circuit.

TI  - Quantitative cerebral blood flow determinations in acute ischemic stroke. Relationship to computed tomography and angiography [published erratum appears in Stroke 1998 Apr;29(4):873]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The advent of new modalities to treat acute ischemic stroke presents the need for accurate, early diagnosis. In acute ischemic stroke, CT scans are frequently normal or reveal only subtle hypodense changes. This study explored the utility and increased sensitivity of xenonenhanced CT (XeCT) in the diagnosis of acute cerebral ischemia and investigated the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements and early CT and angiographic findings in acute stroke. METHODS: The CT scans, XeCT scans, and angiograms of 20 patients who presented within 6 hours of acute anterior circulation ischemic strokes were analyzed. RESULTS: CT scans were abnormal in 11 (55%) of 20 patients. XeCT scans were abnormal in all 20 (100%) patients, showing regions of interest with CBF < 20 (mL/100 g per minute) in the symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories. The mean CBF in the symptomatic MCA territories was significantly lower than than of the asymptomatic MCA territories (P < .0005). In patients with basal ganglia hypodensities, the mean symptomatic MCA territory CBF was significantly lower than that of patients who did not exhibit these early CT findings (P < .05). The mean symptomatic MCA territory CBF in patients with angiographic M1 occlusions was significantly lower than that of patients whose infarcts were caused by MCA branch occlusions (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that XeCT is more sensitive than CT in detecting acute strokes and that CBF measurements correlate with early CT and angiographic findings. XeCT may allow for the hyperacute identification of subsets of patients with acute ischemic events who are less likely to benefit and more likely to derive complications from aggressive stroke therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document that a polyclonal antiserum to calretinin, a 29-kd calcium-binding protein, consistently decorates normal and tumor mesothelial cells in cytologic preparations. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-three archival cytologic specimens from eight patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma and 13 from patients with metastatic serous effusions were destained and then immunostained with anticalretinin antiserum. For investigation of cell suspensions, four pleural fluids were incubated with anticalretinin antiserum. After cytocentrifugation the specimens were stained in accordance with the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. For electron microscopic examination the cell suspensions were then incubated with gold-labeled antirabbit antibody. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity of this new immunocytochemical approach reached 100% for the eight malignant mesotheliomas investigated. Only 3 of the 13 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the serous membranes included in this study were weakly reactive, accounting for 81% specificity. Binding of anticalretinin antiserum to living mesothelial cells was consistently documented in all four cases investigated. CONCLUSION: Calretinin is a very useful marker for positive identification of normal and tumor mesothelial cells in serous effusions.

PMID- 9395572
TI  - Cellular calcium and sodium regulation, salt-sensitivity and essential hypertension in African Americans.  
AB  - The predisposition of African Americans to the salt sensitive form of essential hypertension may result from increased freely exchangeable Ca in intracellular Ca stores and a higher cellular Ca turnover (i.e., enhanced Ca entry into and accelerated Ca extrusion from the cytosol). These alterations entail higher activities of Ca extrusion transport systems, including the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCE), which extrudes Ca in exchange for external Na+, and plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA) that extrudes Ca in exchange for external protons. The higher activity of PMCA, coupled with a higher metabolic activity resulting from a rise in freely exchangeable Ca, increase cellular acid load. Adaptive cellular mechanisms must evolve under these conditions, whereby increased activity of the Na/H exchanger (NHE-1) maintains normal cytosolic pH by enhancing the extrusion of cytosolic protons in exchange for extracellular Na. Cells with increased cellular Ca stores and enhanced Ca turnover may be particularly vulnerable to the factors that inhibit the Na-pump. By inhibiting the Na-pump, these factors diminish the transmembrane Na gradient and consequently inhibit the forward mode of the NCE. Since cells from African Americans show increased Ca turnover, they should retain more Ca upon exposure to Na-pump inhibitors; a heightened sensitivity to Na-pump inhibitors could therefore underlie the propensity of African Americans and other individuals with accelerated cellular Ca turnover rate to the salt sensitive form of essential hypertension. Accelerated cellular Ca turnover in African Americans also explains their better response to Ca antagonists compared with other antihypertensive drugs.

Although both mutant enzymes were catalytically as active as the wild-type PEPC, they showed much less sensitivity to malate, an allosteric inhibitor, similarly to the phosphorylated wild-type PEPC. A maize protein kinase of 30 kDa which is known to be specific to PEPC (PEPC-PK), phosphorylated K12N as well as the wild-type PEPC but not S15D. The phosphorylation of K12N further diminished the sensitivity to malate. Thus, a positive charge of the conserved Lys-12 is not required for the recognition by PEPC-PK but contributes to the intrinsic sensitivity to malate inhibition.

Comparable analysis of p53 status with sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by photodynamic therapy has not been reported. In the current study we examined photosensitivity in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells exhibiting either wild-type p53, mutated p53 or deleted p53 expression. Experiments were performed using a purpurin, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2)-, or a porphyrin, Photofrin (PH)-based photosensitizer. Total SnET2 accumulation was comparable in all three cell lines. Uptake of PH was highest in cells expressing wild-type p53 but incubation conditions could be adjusted to achieve equivalent cellular PH levels during experiments that analyzed photosensitivity. Survival measurements demonstrated that HL60 cells expressing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to PH- and SnET2-mediated photosensitization, as well as to UVC irradiation, when compared to HL60 cells exhibiting deleted or mutated p53 phenotypes. A rapid apoptotic response was observed following purpurin- and porphyrin-induced photosensitization in all cell lines. Results of this study indicate that photosensitivity is increased in HL60 cells expressing wild-type p53 and that photosensitizer-mediated oxidative stress can induce apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism in HL60 cells.

TI  - SARPs: a family of secreted apoptosis-related proteins.  
AB  - Quiescent mouse embryonic C3H/10T1/2 cells are more resistant to different proapoptotic stimuli than are these cells in the exponential phase of growth. However, the exponentially growing 10T1/2 cells are resistant to inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis, whereas quiescent cells die upon these treatments. Conditioned medium from quiescent 10T1/2 cells possesses anti-apoptotic activity, suggesting the presence of protein(s) that function as an inhibitor of the apoptotic program. Using differential display technique, we identified and cloned a cDNA designated sarp1 (secreted apoptosis-related protein) that is expressed in quiescent but not in exponentially growing 10T1/2 cells. Hybridization studies with sarp1 revealed two additional family members. Cloning and sequencing of sarp2 and sarp3 revealed 38% and 40% sequence identity to sarp1, respectively. Human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells stably transfected with sarp1 or infected with SARP1-expressing adenovirus became more resistant, whereas cells transfected with sarp2 displayed increased sensitivity to different proapoptotic stimuli. Expression of sarp family members is tissue specific. sarp mRNAs encode secreted proteins that possess a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) homologous to the CRD of frizzled proteins but lack putative membrane-spanning segments. Expression of SARPs modifies the intracellular levels of beta-catenin, suggesting that SARPs interfere with the Wnt-frizzled proteins signaling pathway.

TI  - Statistical aspects of the normal visual field in short-wavelength automated perimetry.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the intraindividual and interindividual characteristics of normal sensitivity derived by short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) as a function of threshold algorithm. To determine also the influence of ocular media absorption on the magnitude of the interindividual variation in normal sensitivity, and hence the confidence limits, derived by SWAP. METHODS: The sample comprised 51 normal subjects, stratified for age by decade (mean age, 55.5 years; range, 24-83 years) and experienced in white-on-white (W-W) perimetry and SWAP. One randomly assigned eye of each subject was examined on three occasions with Program 30-2 of the 640 Humphrey Field Analyzer using the Full Threshold and FASTPAC strategies for SWAP and W-W perimetries. Ocular media absorption (OMA) was assessed by the difference in scotopic sensitivity to stimuli of 410 and 560 nm. RESULTS: The group mean examination time (P < 0.001) was greater for SWAP than for W-W perimetry for both the Full Threshold (15.0% longer) and FASTPAC strategies (16.8% longer). The gradient of the age-decline in Mean Sensitivity for SWAP was approximately 25% less steep when corrected for OMA than when uncorrected. The interindividual normal variability, expressed as the coefficient of variation, for SWAP without correction for OMA was 2.7 times greater (range 2.0-3.9), and with correction 1.9 times greater (range 1.4-2.9), than that for W-W perimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The increased interindividual normal variability of SWAP, exacerbated by the lack of correction for OMA, currently limits the utility of SWAP in that the reduction in sensitivity required to indicate abnormality was proportionately greater than for W-W perimetry.

AB  - A novel method for detection and identification of specific alleles has been developed utilizing immobilized mismatch binding protein (IMBP). The assay involves the use of biotin-labeled probes, which are prepared by PCR amplification of cloned fragments with known sequence. The use of probes avoids many of the problems associated with the extreme sensitivity of IMBP assays to errors in PCR amplification. The method can be used to monitor PCR fidelity and to genotype both diploid and haploid organisms and has been used to distinguish rifampicin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to detect and distinguish two alleles of the sheep prion protein gene involved in susceptibility to scrapie.

TI  - Nicotine withdrawal leads to increased sensitivity of serotonergic neurons to the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT.  
AB  - In order to explore the neurophysiology of nicotine withdrawal, we examined the activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus in rats undergoing withdrawal from chronic exposure to nicotine. Animals were exposed to nicotine (6 mg/kg per day base) via SC implanted osmotic minipumps. After 12 days the pumps were removed and the animals allowed to go through spontaneous withdrawal. Rats were anesthetized on various days of the procedure and the effect of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT on the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus was examined. The sensitivity of serotonergic neurons to 8-OH-DPAT was not changed by the chronic administration of nicotine or saline; slightly increased on day 2 of withdrawal; significantly increased on days 3 and 4 of withdrawal; and no longer significantly increased by day 7 of withdrawal. These results indicate that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus have an increased sensitivity to systemically administered 8-OH-DPAT in rats undergoing nicotine withdrawal and that the serotonergic system may play a role in the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.

TI  - New biochemical markers of bone resorption in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  
AB  - We performed a comparative study on the sensitivity of the determination of several biochemical markers of bone resorption: urinary calcium/creatinine, free pyridinolines (F-Pyr), free deoxypyridinoline (F-Dpyr), carboxyterminal telopeptide of collagen I (CTX) and aminoterminal crosslinked telopeptides of collagen I (NTX) in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The study included 19 untreated osteoporotic postmenopausal women, aged 59 +/- 6 years, range 46-70 and 16 healthy control postmenopausal women, aged 56 +/- 7 years, range 48-70 years. The following bone markers were determined in 2-h fasting urine samples: calcium/creatinine (atomic absorptiometry), F-Pyr (ELISA, Metra), F-Dpyr (ELISA, Metra), CTX (Crosslaps, Cis bio International) and NTX (ELISA, Osteomark, OSTEX). Values of all markers were expressed as urinary creatinine (Cr) ratios. We found a significant increase in all the studied biochemical markers of bone resorption in osteoporotic patients with respect to control women. Areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves corresponding to F-Pyr/Cr, Calcium/ Cr, NTX/Cr, CTX/Cr and F-Dpyr/Cr were 74%, 75%, 93.4%, 95.7% and 96% respectively. There were no significant differences among the areas of the ROC curves corresponding to NTX, CTX and F-Dpyr, but areas under urinary calcium and F-Pyr were significantly lower. Among the biochemical markers of bone resorption studied, F-Dpyr, CTX and NTX presented the best discrimination between osteoporotic and control women. F-Dpyr/Cr sensitivity was 79% with a specificity of 100%, CTX/Cr sensitivity was also 79% with a specificity of 100% and NTX/Cr sensitivity was 52% with a specificity of 100%.

TI  - Differential diagnosis of tumours of the minor salivary glands of the palate by computed tomography.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the CT criteria for differentiating malignant from benign tumours of the minor salivary glands of the palate and to evaluate their accuracy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CT findings of 63 patients with histopathologically proven minor salivary gland tumours of the palate (23 malignant, 40 benign) were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Aggressive bone destruction was a specific finding of malignant tumours, but was seen in only 57% (13/23) of this series. Extension into the pterygopalatine fossa was observed in seven malignant and one benign tumour. Calcifications within a tumour were observed in four cases, all of which were malignant. These three CT findings were significantly more frequent in malignant tumours. Using any one of these as the criterion for the malignancy, the sensitivity was 78% (18/23), specificity 98% (39/40) and accuracy 90% (57/63). CONCLUSION: Malignant tumours of the minor salivary glands of the palate are very likely to show any or all of aggressive bone destruction, extension into the pterygopalatine fossa and calcification, whereas benign tumours can almost always be correctly diagnosed by their absence.

TI  - NADPH-oxidase-dependent superoxide production by myocyte-derived H9c2 cells: influence of ischemia, heat shock, cycloheximide and cytochalasin D.  
AB  - Extracellular oxygen radicals produced by H9c2 rat heart cells in monolayer cultures during ischemia and subsequent reoxygenation were monitored using the luminol-horseradish peroxidase-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. As expected, the photon count diminishes during ischemia but again rapidly attains normal values following reoxygenation. In the presence of superoxide dismutase, this photon emission is repressed, as is also the case in the presence of diphenylene iodonium, a specific inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase activity. Thus, the conclusion seems justified that H9c2 rat heart cells in monolayer cultures produce superoxide radicals extracellularly due to an NADPH oxidase-like action. In order to characterize this extracellular superoxide-generating system, we determined its sensitivity to increased temperatures, inhibition of protein synthesis and perturbations of cytoskeletal structures. Heat shocks result in a delayed inactivation of the NADPH oxidase activity followed by recovery, the kinetics of which depend on the imposed heat shock temperature. This inactivation is independent of protein synthesis and actin cytoskeletal structures, but the recovery of the enzyme's activity is dependent on these entities.

TI  - Heterogeneity of angiotensin action in renal circulation.  
AB  - Reported concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) in renal interstitial fluid are as high as 10 nM. Despite such high concentrations, intrarenal arterial infusion of Ang II at rates that induce far less change in renal Ang II concentration still elicits renal vasoconstriction. We examined whether the glomerular afferent arterioles (Af-Art) was more sensitive to intraluminal than extraluminal Ang II in superficial or juxtamedullary nephrons. Rat superficial Af-Arts with the intact glomerulus were microdissected and perfused in vitro at 70 mmHg, while juxtamedullary Af-Arts were visualized in isolated perfused kidneys (at 100 mm Hg) according to the method of Casellas and Navar. Increasing doses of Ang II (1 pM to 10 nM) or norepinephrine (NE; 1 nM to 1 microM) were added to either bath (extraluminal) or arteriolar perfusate (intraluminal). Decreases in luminal diameter induced by Ang II were significantly larger with intraluminal than extraluminal administration in superficial Af-Art: at 100 pM the diameter decreased by 52 +/- 8% (N = 6) and 7 +/- 3% with intraluminal and extraluminal administration, respectively. In contrast, in the juxtamedullary Af-Arts intraluminal and extraluminal Ang II caused similar constriction. On the other hand, there was no difference in intraluminal versus extraluminal NE action in either superficial or juxtamedullary nephrons. In conclusion, glomerular Af-Arts seem to have a higher sensitivity to luminal than interstitial Ang II in superficial but not juxtamedullary nephrons. Such heterogeneities in Ang II action may be important in the control of glomerular hemodynamics under various physiological and pathological conditions.

TI  - Determinants of pressure pain threshold in adult twins: evidence that shared environmental influences predominate.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in determining pain perception in a classical twin study. Dolorimeter measurements of pressure pain threshold (PPT) were recorded in 609 healthy female-female twin pairs of whom 269 pairs were monozygotic (MZ) and 340 were dizygotic (DZ). There was a strong correlation (R) in PPT in both MZ and DZ pairs (R(MZ) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.49, 0.65]; R(DZ) = 0.51, 95% CI: [0.42, 0.59]). The slight excess in intraclass correlation observed in MZ when compared with DZ twins corresponds to a heritability for PPT of only 10% and is not statistically significant. Neither estimate of intraclass correlation was substantially altered after adjusting for a range of potential confounding variables including age, current tobacco and alcohol use, current analgesic use, psychological status assessed by the general health questionnaire, and social class. The dolorimeter measurements were shown to be reliable (between observer agreement R = 0.66; within observer agreement R = 0.70-0.76) and stable over time. In conclusion, these data suggest that there is no significant genetic contribution to the strong correlation in PPT that is observed in twin pairs. These findings reinforce the view that learned patterns of behaviour within families are an important determinant of perceived sensitivity to pain.

TI  - Assessment of microtubule stabilizers by semiautomated in vitro microtubule protein polymerization and mitotic block assays.  
AB  - Paclitaxel (Taxol) a clinically active anticancer agent, exerts its cytotoxicity by inducing tubulin polymerization, leading to cellular mitotic block. In contrast, other antimitotic drugs, such as colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and vinblastine, act by depolymerizing microtubules. We report here (a) a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs and (b) a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis. The microtubule-polymerizing assay measured the turbidity of bovine brain microtubule protein (MTP) polymerized by the test compound in a 96-well plate. We maximized the sensitivity of this assay by conducting the polymerization reaction at 20 degrees C, at which temperature the baseline reaction, i.e. the basic ability of the untreated MTP control to polymerize, was minimal. At 20 degrees C, the effect of 0.05 microg/ml of paclitaxel on MTP could be detected, whereas at 37 degrees C, > 1 microg/ml of paclitaxel was required to detect a significant effect relative to untreated MTP. We describe the analysis of the complex curves of MTP polymerization with varying concentrations of test compounds. The polymerization of microtubules leads to cells being blocked in mitosis. This mitotic blocking effect in intact cells was determined using a cell settling chamber which allowed eight samples to be deposited on a slide. This method required a smaller number of cells (10(3) - 10[5]), maintained cell morphology, and allowed for rapid screening of samples. The activity of several new paclitaxel analogs is reported.

TI  - A new application of BCG antibody for rapid screening of various tissue microorganisms [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In routine dermatopathology there is growing demand for a simple, fast, cost-effective, and highly sensitive screening tool for the detection of microorganisms. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether immunostaining with polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), which is known for its interspecies cross-reactivity, is a suitable screening method for many common microorganisms in dermatopathologic specimens. METHODS: A total of 254 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin specimens of viral, protozoal, fungal, and bacterial infections were stained with appropriate histochemical stains and with anti-BCG. RESULTS: Anti-BCG labeled bacteria and fungi with high sensitivity and minimal background staining, but did not react with spirochetes, viruses, or protozoa (Leishmania). The quality and sensitivity of anti-BCG staining were superior to conventional histochemical stains. CONCLUSION: Because of its cross-reactivity with many bacteria and fungi as well as its high sensitivity and minimal background staining, the anti-BCG immunostain is a promising screening tool for the detection of the most common bacterial and fungal microorganisms in paraffin-embedded skin specimens.

Twenty-two fecal samples that were collected from patients with diarrhoea caused by E. coli O157:H7 and frozen for 6 months were examined directly by RC-PCR, conventional PCR assay using by ThermalCycler 9600-R (Roche, TC-PCR here after) and by the culture method using tellurite-cefixime sorbitol MacConkey (direct method). These examinations were done also after being injected into TCV-TSB and incutated at 35 degrees C overnight (indirect method).  The sensitivity of RC-PCR and TC-PCR using a diluted suspension of broth enriched at 35 degrees C overnight were 4.1 pg and 410 fg, respectively. Positive results in the direct method were obtained in 7 for RC-PCR, 10 for TC-PCR and 5 for culture. Positive results on indirect assay were obtained in 9 for RC-PCR, 9 for TC-PCR and 7 for culture. It was demonstrated that the RC-PCR assay was able to detect Shiga-like toxin gene in feces in less than 90 minutes after being received at the laboratory.

TI  - Analysis of respiratory syncytial virus in clinical samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction restriction mapping.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genomes. The primers were designed from published sequences and selected from conserved regions of the genome encoding for the N protein of subgroups A and B of RSV. PCR was applied to 20 specimens from children admitted to the respiratory ward of "William Soler" Pediatric Hospital in Havana City with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The PCR was compared with viral isolation and with an indirect immunofluorescence technique that employs monoclonal antibodies of subgroups A and B. Of 20 nasopharyngeal exudates, 10 were found positive by the three assayed methods. In only two cases, samples that yielded positive RNA-PCR were found negative by indirect immunofluorescence and cell culture. Considering viral isolation as the "gold standard" technique, RNA-PCR had 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. RNA-PCR is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of the RSV genome. Technical advantages are discussed.

TI  - [Value of classical and new criteria of electrocardiography in diagnosis of hypoxic cor pulmonale evaluated by hemodynamics tests]  
AB  - Electrocardiogram is commonly used in the diagnosis of cor pulmonale in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary hemodynamics being the definite method for diagnosis the disease can be used to vary the ecg criteria for diagnosis cor pulmonale. After excluding patients with old myocardial infarction and with pulmonary wedge pressure > 12 mm Hg in 66 patients aged 65.2 with advanced COPD (FEV1 0.78 +/- 0.3 litre) pulmonary hemodynamics and ecg were performed at the same time. The signs of right ventricular hypertrophy were sought for using 3 sets of criteria: the World Health Organisation criteria, new compiled Lehtonen et al. Criteria and right ventricular precordial leads. WHO criteria had a specificity and sensitivity of 50% and 57.6%, the modified right precordial leads-53% and 64.5% and compiled Lehtonen's criteria -57% and 59% respectively. In 32 patients with mild pulmonary hypertension (20-29 mm Hg) sensitivity of WHO criteria was 46.8%, right precordial leads -51.6%, and Lethonen and co. Criteria -50%, in 10 patients with moderate pulmonary hypertension (30-39 mm Hg) 59%-62.5%-50%, in 9 patients with severe hypertension (> or = 40 mm Hg) 100%-100%-100% respectively. Our studies confirm the poor sensitivity and of ecg criteria for diagnosis of cor pulmonale (pulmonary hypertension) in COPD. However, in mild and moderate pulmonary hypertension, sensitivity of ecg diagnosis of cor pulmonale is improved if right modifieds precordial leads are used. New, compiled Lehtonen's criteria failed to improved diagnosis of diagnosis of cor pulmonale. All studied sets of criteria are highly sensitive in COPD patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

TI  - Overexpression of a kinase-inactive ATR protein causes sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and defects in cell cycle checkpoints.  
AB  - ATR, a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related protein homologous to ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), is important for the survival of human cells following many forms of DNA damage. Expression of a kinase-inactive allele of ATR (ATRkd) in human fibroblasts causes increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), cis-platinum and methyl methanesulfonate, but only slight UV radiation sensitivity. ATRkd overexpression abrogates the G2/M arrest after exposure to IR, and overexpression of wild-type ATR complements the radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype of cells lacking ATM, suggesting a potential functional overlap between these proteins. ATRkd overexpression also causes increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea that is associated with microtubule-mediated nuclear abnormalities. These observations are consistent with uncoupling of certain mitotic events from the completion of S-phase. Thus, ATR is an important component of multiple DNA damage response pathways and may be involved in the DNA replication (S/M) checkpoint.

TI  - Ectopic expression of Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xL rescues Ramos B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis.  
AB  - The human Burkitt lymphoma Ramos B cell line can be induced to undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of different agents, including calcium ionophores, anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) and macromolecular synthesis inhibitors. In addition, following up-regulation of the Fas (CD95) surface receptor by CD40 ligation, these cells also become susceptible to apoptosis induction by Fas ligation. We have previously shown that protection from calcium ionophore- and macromolecular synthesis inhibitor-induced apoptosis by CD40 ligation is associated with a rapid up-regulation of Bcl-xL followed by a more moderate and delayed up-regulation of Bcl-2. We show here that overexpression of Bcl-xL, like Bcl-2, protects Ramos cells from apoptosis induction in response to calcium ionophore, anti-Ig and macromolecular synthesis inhibition. However, in contrast to Bcl-2, ectopic overexpression of Bcl-xL does not rescue from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, in Ramos B cells, the Fas apoptotic pathway exhibits differential sensitivity to inhibition by Bcl-2 family members. These findings also suggest that CD40 signaling provides a switch which renders the cells susceptible to Fas-ligand mediated apoptosis through up-regulation of Fas whilst affording protection from anti-Ig-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of Bcl-xL.

TI  - Altered action of angiotensin II in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus of recent onset.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases insulin sensitivity in healthy volunteers. This effect is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow. In the past it had been documented that some biological actions of Ang II are altered in diabetes. We addressed the issue of whether this is also true for its action on insulin sensitivity. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (aged 43+/-9 years) and 15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of recent onset (aged 45+/-9 years) were allocated in random order in a double-blind placebo-controlled design to be administered a sham infusion or an infusion of 2 ng Ang II/kg per min. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (the M value) was measured with the euglycaemic clamp technique, leg muscle blood flow (MBF) with plethysmography, blood pressure with a Dinamap device, and glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow with the steady-state inulin (Cin) and p-aminohippurate (CPAH) clearance methods, respectively. RESULTS: In volunteers the mean M-value after Ang II infusion (10.1+/-1.5 mg/kg per min) was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that after sham infusion (8.2+/-0.9 mg/kg per min). In contrast, in diabetic patients it was not significantly different with Ang II (6.1+/-1.3 mg/kg per min) and sham infusion (5.5+/-1.2 mg/kg per min). The difference in the mean absolute increase in the M value (deltaM) between groups was significant (P< 0.02). The Ang II-induced increase in MBF under euglycaemic conditions was attenuated in diabetic patients (from 15.0+/-3.5 to 15.5+/-3.9 ml/100 ml per min, NS) compared with volunteers (from 16.8+/-3.3 to 19.1+/-3.7 ml/100 ml per min, P< 0.01). Again, the difference between the mean absolute increases in MBF (deltaMBF) in the groups was significant (P < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between deltaMBF and deltaM (r= 0.62, P<0.01). The absolute acute increase in mean arterial blood pressure with Ang II was similar in diabetic patients and volunteers. Mean Cin, CPAH and fractional sodium excretion values were significantly lower and renal vascular resistances and filtration fractions higher during the Ang II than they were during the placebo clamp period. This was observed in patients as well as in healthy subjects, but the effects of Ang II on renal haemodynamics and sodium handling were more pronounced in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NIDDM of recent onset the stimulatory effect of Ang II on insulin sensitivity and on skeletal muscle blood flow is attenuated. In contrast, the effects of Ang II on renal perfusion and sodium handling are more pronounced in patients with NIDDM than they are in healthy subjects.

TI  - Choosing a practical screening instrument to identify patients at risk for diabetic foot ulceration.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 3 sensory perception testing instruments to screen for risk of diabetic foot ulceration. METHODS: This case-control study prospectively measured the degree of peripheral sensory neuropathy in diabetic patients with and without foot ulcers. We enrolled 115 age-matched diabetic patients (40% male) with a case-control ratio of approximately 1:3 (30 cases and 85 controls) from a tertiary care diabetic foot specialty clinic. Cases were defined as individuals who had an existing foot ulceration or a history of a recently (< 4 weeks) healed foot ulceration. Controls were defined as subjects with no foot ulceration history. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of 2 commonly used nephropathy assessment tools (vibration perception threshold testing and the Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament wire system) and a 4-question verbal neuropathy score to evaluate for presence of foot ulceration. RESULTS: A vibration perception threshold testing using 25 V and lack of perception at 4 or more sites using the Semmes-Weinstein 10-g monofilament wire system had a significantly higher specificity than neuropathy score used. The neuropathy score was most sensitive when 1 or more answers were affirmative. When modalities were combined, particularly the monofilament wire system plus vibration perception threshold testing and the neuropathy score plus the monofilament wire system, there was a substantial increase in specificity with little or no diminution in sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The early detection of peripheral neuropathy or loss of "protective sensation" is paramount to instituting a structured treatment plan to prevent lower extremity amputation. The results of our study suggest that all 3 sensory perception testing instruments are sensitive in identifying patients at risk for ulceration. Combining modalities appears to increase specificity with very little or no diminution in sensitivity.

TI  - Role of glutathione S-transferases in the resistance of human colon cancer cell lines to doxorubicin.  
AB  - The anthracycline doxorubicin has little activity against colorectal cancers. It is hypothesized that this is attributable to a multifactorial resistance mechanism in which the glutathione S-transferases (GST) may play a role. We studied the relationship between GST expression and doxorubicin resistance in four human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HT-29, LoVo, SW620, and Caco-2), with the goal of modulating GST activity to overcome resistance. Caco-2 cells were the most resistant to doxorubicin, showing an IC50 value approximately 80- to 90-fold higher than HT-29 or LoVo and 600-fold higher than SW620. Total GST catalytic activity was significantly higher in Caco-2 cells compared with the other lines. All four cell lines expressed GST-pi at the catalytic activity, protein, and mRNA levels; however, no significant differences were observed among the cell lines. GST-mu expression was not detectable at the protein and mRNA levels, and the four cell lines displayed very low catalytic activity toward a GST-mu-selective substrate. Caco-2 cells showed a unique, highly expressed GST-alpha-immunoreactive band that was not detected in the other lines; however, the glutathione peroxidase activity of Caco-2 cells was the lowest among the four cell lines. Neither ethacrynic acid nor glutathione analogues that function as GST class-selective inhibitors were able to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in these colon cancer cell lines, as demonstrated in both microplate colorimetric and clonogenic assays. The multidrug resistance-associated protein and P-glycoprotein were either not detectable or expressed at such low levels that they are not likely to contribute to the differences in doxorubicin sensitivity observed among these cell lines.

TI  - The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants [see comments]  
AB  - The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state.

TI  - The effect of different chemotherapeutic agents on the enrichment of DNA mismatch repair-deficient tumour cells.  
AB  - Loss of DNA mismatch repair is a common finding in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer as well as in many types of sporadic human tumours. We compared the effect of loss of DNA mismatch repair on drug sensitivity as measured by a clonogenic assay with its effect on the ability of the same drug to enrich for mismatch repair-deficient cells in a proliferating tumour cell population. Mixed populations containing 50% DNA mismatch repair-deficient cells constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein and 50% mismatch repair-proficient cells were exposed to different chemotherapeutic agents. 6-Thioguanine, to which DNA mismatch repair-deficient cells are known to be resistant, was included as a control. The results in the cytotoxicity assays and in the enrichment experiments were concordant. Treatment with either carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide or 6-thioguanine resulted in enrichment for mismatch repair-deficient cells, and clonogenic assays demonstrated resistance to these agents, which varied from 1.3- to 4.8-fold. Treatment with melphalan, paclitaxel, perfosfamide or tamoxifen failed to enrich for mismatch repair-deficient cells, and no change in sensitivity to these agents was detected in the clonogenic assays. These results identify the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin as additional agents for which loss of DNA mismatch repair causes drug resistance. The concordance of the results from the two assay systems validates the enrichment assay as a rapid and reliable method for screening for the effect of loss of DNA mismatch repair on sensitivity to additional drugs.

TI  - Relevance of biophysical concepts in the scintigraphic detection of gastrointestinal leaks.  
AB  - The application of some physical concepts is described to explain the inherent insensitivity of 99Tc(m)-red blood cell (RBC) and 99Tc(m)-human serum albumin (HSA) in the detection of gastrointestinal bleeding and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), respectively. Inferences drawn from the laws of radioactive decay, partition physics, hydrodynamics and electrostatic forces have been used to suggest that the clearance pattern, size and charge of radiopharmaceuticals, and the viscosity of the medium, affect the sensitivity of these tests. As the outflow from gastrointestinal lesions is non-specific, other labelled macromolecules can be used instead of RBCs or HSA. Based on biophysical concepts, we suggest that chargeless macromolecules in the size range 5-50 nm are superior to the conventional agents used for this purpose.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined how patient acceptability influences the effectiveness of directly observed therapy for tuberculosis. METHODS: Decision and sensitivity analyses were used in assessing influences. RESULTS: If mandatory directly observed therapy discourages 6% of initial tuberculosis patients (range: 4% to 10%) from seeking care, then such therapy will be less effective than self-administered therapy. Directly observed therapy is more effective than repeated self-administered therapy for patients failing to complete initial treatment unless 32% (range: 27% to 38%) of patients avoid seeking care. CONCLUSIONS: Patient acceptability must be taken into consideration before selecting public health strategies.

TI  - Value of computer-assisted quantitative nuclear grading in differentiation of normal urothelial cells from low and high grade transitional cell carcinoma.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of computer-assisted quantitative nuclear grading (QNG) using a microspectrophotometer and morphometry software to differentiate Feulgen-stained nuclei captured from normal urothelium, low grade transitional cell carcinoma (LG-TCC) and high grade transitional cell carcinoma (HG-TCC) cytology specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Feulgen-stained nuclei from a series of normal volunteers (urologic disease-free history) and from biopsy-confirmed cases of LG-TCC and HG-TCC were evaluated using a CAS-200 image analysis system. Thirty-eight nuclear morphometric descriptors (NMDs) were measured for each nucleus using a software conversion system. Backwards stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to assess which of the NMDs contributed to QNG statistical models that could differentiate between nuclei from normals vs. LG-TCC, normals vs. HG-TCC, and LG-TCC vs. HG-TCC. Receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUC), as well as cell classification accuracy, were used to assess these differences. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P < .0001) were observed between all three categories. In the LG-TCC vs. normals, the QNG solution model required 16/38 features, with an AUC = 93%, a sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 87% and negative predictive value (NPV) = 84%. The QNG solution model for normals vs. HG-TCC required 12/38 nuclear features yielding an AUC = 99%, sensitivity = 99%, specificity = 98%, PPV = 98% and NPV = 99%. The QNG solution model for LG-TCC vs. HG-TCC required 17/38 nuclear features, with an AUC = 99%, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 97%, PPV = 97% and NPV = 96%. CONCLUSION: Computer-assisted QNG cell classifiers based upon the measurement of 38 nuclear features, including size, shape and chromatin organization, are capable of differentiating normal urothelial nuclei from LG-TCC and HG-TCC nuclei as well as LG-TCC from HG-TCC nuclei. The QNG cell classifier has shown conclusively that there are morphometric differences between normal urothelial and LG-TCC nuclei that may not be apparent to the naked eye and that it may be useful in helping the pathologist determine the presence or absence of LG-TCC in bladder cytology specimens.

TI  - Aerobic endurance exercise or circuit-type resistance training for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance?  
AB  - The role of physical activity in the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is of utmost importance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of aerobic endurance exercise and circuit-type resistance training in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Twenty-two individuals participated in the study. Fourteen subjects were enrolled in the aerobic endurance exercise part of the study; seven exercised regularly for six months, while seven served as controls. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) was measured and insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT). Eight subjects participated in a circuit-type resistance training program for three months. Insulin sensitivity and substrate oxidation were then assessed using the euglycemic insulin clamp technique combined with indirect calorimetry. The aerobic endurance exercise program caused in increase in VO2max (21.6 +/- 1.9 to 25.4 +/- 2.4 ml/kg.min; p < 0.05) and HDL-cholesterol (1.14 +/- 0.06 to 1.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/l; p < 0.05), but no change in insulin sensitivity nor insulin secretion occurred. However, comparing the changes between the intervention and control group, the differences disappeared. Circuit-type resistance training increased insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal) by 23% (p < 0.05), primarily due to a 27% increase in non-oxidative glucose metabolism. Both circuit-type resistance training and aerobic endurance exercise seem to have beneficial effects in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. However, by improving insulin sensitivity, circuit-type resistance training may postpone the manifestations of NIDDM in these high-risk individuals and should therefore be included in an exercise program for IGT subjects.

TI  - Liposome-mediated enhancement of the sensitivity in immunoassays of proteins and peptides in surface plasmon resonance spectrometry.  
AB  - A recently developed liposome sandwich immunoassay for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), to be applied in microtiter plates, is tailored for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry. The assay is performed on a thin (approximately 20 nm) polystyrene layer that covers a gold surface. This way, analytical data obtained from microtiter plate technology can directly be extrapolated toward SPR. For assaying the antigen IFN-gamma, a 16-kDa cytokine, a capture monoclonal antibody is physically adsorbed onto the polystyrene surface. After addition of the sample containing IFN-gamma, a biotinylated detecting antibody is added. Avidin is used as a bridging molecule between the biotinylated antibody and the biotinylated liposomes. All solutions are prepared with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4). This avoids additional changes in index of refraction caused by the use of various buffer solutions in immunoassays on microtiter plates for coating, binding, and washing procedures. It is shown that, when liposomes are used, a substantial enhancement of the detection limit is achieved. The "liposome" strategy improves the sensitivity for the IFN-gamma assay approximately 4 x 10(4) times and the detection limit to low picomolar. The method is generally applicable to other sandwich immunoassays.

TI  - MRI of lumbar spondylosis: a comparison of sagittal T2 weighted and three sequence examinations.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether a single T2 weighted sagittal sequence could replace the conventional three sequence examination of the lumbar spine. The T2 weighted sagittal image of 79 lumbar spine MRI examinations were retrospectively reported by three radiologists. Features relating to degenerative disease were recorded and an assessment made of whether further sequences were likely to add information. On a separate occasion the T1 weighted and T2 weighted sagittal and T2 weighted axial sequences were reported blind in relation to the initial assessment. Areas of disagreement were resolved by consensus opinion. The T2 weighted sequence was compared with the three sequences, taking the three sequence examination as the standard. Disc protrusions were diagnosed from the T2 weighted sagittal images with a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 97%. 22 discs reported as a disc bulge on the T2 weighted sequence were re-classified as a disc protrusion on axial images because of their focal nature. Central canal stenosis was diagnosed on the T2 weighted sagittal sequence with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 95%. After assessing the T2 weighted sequence, it was thought unlikely that further sequences would add extra information in 60% of cases (48/79). However, further information was obtained in 21% of these cases (10/48) when all the sequences were assessed. The extra information gained by using all three sequences was considered to be of greater benefit than the time saved by using a single T2 sagittal sequence. Other diagnoses where the additional sequences proved helpful are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate diagnostic validity of captopril test and scintigraphic test before and after captopril for the detection of renovascular hypertension (RVH) according to applied criteria. Employing blood pressure response to captopril as a criteria sensitivity was 37.0%, specificity 92.1%, positive predictive value 75.0% and negative predictive value 70.2% in the captopril test. Applying plasma renin activity (PRA) response to captopril as a criteria sensitivity was 92.5%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 96.0% in the same test. Renin captopril test has excellent sensitivity and positive predictive value, is easy to perform and inexpensive and therefore may be a useful screening test for RVH in unselected population. With the own criteria used, captopril renoscintigraphy detected RVH with 87.5% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity, 87.5% positive predictive value and 91.7% negative predictive value. Captopril renoscintigraphy is an accurate diagnostic test for the identification of RVH in a clinically selected high-risk population. Common evaluation of both tests does not improve their accuracy in diagnosis of RVH.

TI  - Lung function and bacterial proliferation in experimental neonatal pneumonia in ventilated rabbits exposed to monoclonal antibody to surfactant protein A.  
AB  - Surfactant protein A (SP-A) increases the resistance of surfactant to inhibition by plasma and other proteins. In a previous study we found that a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody (R 5) increased the sensitivity of surfactant to inhibition by fibrinogen in vivo and in vitro. SP-A has been shown to stimulate microbial phagocytosis and killing by alveolar macrophages. We hypothesized that using R 5 to inactivate SP-A in an animal model mimicking congenital group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia might result in increased bacterial proliferation and a deterioration in lung function. Newborn near term rabbits were delivered by Cesarean section, anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated for 5 h in a plethysmograph system allowing measurement of dynamic lung-thorax compliance. Postnatally the animals received one intratracheal injection (5 ml/kg) of R 5, nonspecific IgG, or normal saline. At 30 min all animals received a standard dose of an encapsulated GBS strain by intratracheal injection. The number of bacteria (mean log10 CFU/g lung +/- S.D.; CFU = colony forming unit) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Histologic lung sections were judged by light microscopy. Bacterial proliferation was similar in rabbits treated with the monoclonal antibody (9.33 +/- 0.39; n = 14) and in control animals receiving saline (9.16 +/- 0.35; n = 14) or nonspecific IgG (9.26 +/- 0.31; n = 11). No significant differences were noted on the histologic analysis or in measurements of lung function. We conclude that intratracheal instillation of a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody did not increase bacterial proliferation in GBS-infected newborn rabbits. These findings suggest that SP-A does not play an important role in protection against encapsulated GBS strains in the neonatal period.

TI  - Differences among type I, II, and III inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in ligand-binding affinity influence the sensitivity of calcium stores to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate.  
AB  - Type I, II, and III inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors are expressed selectively in different cell lines and tissues. We examined whether type I, II, and III InsP3 receptors differ in ligand-binding affinity and whether such differences influence the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to InsP3. Initially, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, AR4-2J rat pancreatoma cells, and RINm5F rat insulinoma cells were studied because these cells express predominantly (>85%) type I, II, and III receptors, respectively. Immunopurification of receptors from these cell lines and measurement of InsP3 binding revealed that the rank order of affinity for InsP3 was type I > type II > type III (binding sites were half-maximally saturated at 1.5, 2.5, and 22.4 nM InsP3, respectively). Examination of Ca2+ store mobilization in permeabilized cells showed that InsP3 was equipotent in SH-SY5Y and AR4-2J cells but was approximately 5-fold less potent in RINm5F cells. In contrast, Ca2+ uptake and InsP3-independent Ca2+ release were very similar in the three cell types. The binding affinity of InsP3 in permeabilized SH-SY5Y, AR4-2J, and RINm5F cells correlated well with its potency as a Ca2+-mobilizing agent and with binding affinity to immunopurified type I, II, and III receptors. Thus, InsP3 receptor binding affinity seems to influence the potency of InsP3 as a Ca2+-mobilizing agent. Finally, immunopurification of type I, II, and III receptors from rat tissues revealed that the affinity differences seen in receptors purified from cultured cells are paralleled in vivo. In combination, the data from cell lines and rat tissues reveal that type I, II, and III receptors bind InsP3 with Kd values of approximately 1, approximately 2, and approximately 40 nM, respectively, and that the selective expression of a particular receptor type will influence the sensitivity of cellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3.

TI  - Sexually transmitted disease risk assessment used among low-risk populations in east central Africa: a review.  
AB  - In sub-Saharan Africa where sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are prevalent but health resources are scarce, algorithms that act as STD/HIV risk assessment (RA) tools for family planning (FP) and maternal/child health (MCH) clinic attenders may be useful. These RA algorithms generally comprise questions about a person's social, economic, demographic, behavioural and clinical background. The answers can be scored or scaled to indicate a higher probability of current STD/HIV infection and thus the need for testing or treatment. RA can be done alone, or can be combined with clinical examination where laboratory diagnosis is not feasible. But how accurate are RA tools? We reviewed six studies at African sites that examined the use of RA combined with a clinical algorithm for STD screening of clinic attendees. Researchers reported the standard measures of test accuracy: sensitivity (per cent of infected women found positive by the tool); specificity (per cent of uninfected women found negative by the tool), and positive predictive value (per cent of women found positive by the tool who are truly infected). Most algorithms had low sensitivity (< 50%) and low positive predictive value (< 20%). The addition of clinical examination, and of leucocyte esterase (LE) testing, improved accuracy. But algorithms that performed well in one site were less accurate at other sites. For illustrative purposes, we considered a hypothetical population of 1,000 women attending a FP clinic. With a prevalence of cervical gonorrhoea of five per cent, algorithm sensitivity of 40%, and algorithm specificity of 75%, the positive predictive value of the RA tool would be 7.7%. In other words, 20 (7.7%) women diagnosed as infected would actually have gonorrhoea, and 237 false positive women would be treated needlessly, with the attendant costs and risks. However, with a disease prevalence above 50%, as might prevail for vaginal infections, and the same sensitivity and specificity figures, the positive predictive value may reach 70-80%. Risk assessment appears to be a relatively easy way to integrate STD management into family planning and MCH practice. However, there is no evidence to show its effectiveness for screening low-risk populations. We urge improvement of these tools, including information on the behaviour of male partners, and addition of simple screening tests such as leucocyte esterase dipsticks.

TI  - Role of different bombesin receptor subtypes mediating contractile activity in cat upper gastrointestinal tract.  
AB  - Mammalian bombesin-like peptides, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB) are known to increase the motility of different segments in the gut. The present study was carried out to identify the bombesin receptor subtypes mediating the contractions induced by exogenous bombesin-like peptides in muscle strips isolated from cat esophagus, fundus, and duodenum. Both GRP-10 and NMB evoked concentration-dependent contractions in circular strips of esophagus and fundus and in longitudinal strips of the duodenum. These contractions were tetrodotoxin- and atropine-resistant. The potency of NMB in esophageal strips was 33 times higher than that of GRP-10. The NMB-preferring receptor antagonists D-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Nal-NH2 (SSocta) and D-Nal-cyclo[Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Val-Cys]-Nal-NH2 (BIM-23127) shifted the NMB and GRP concentration-response curves to the right, while the GRP-preferring receptor antagonist [D-Phe6]Bombesin(6-13)-methyl-ester (BME) did not affect the response to the peptides. Isolated muscle strips from the cat fundus and duodenum showed a higher sensitivity to GRP-10 than to NMB. In both segments, BME shifted the GRP-10 and NMB concentration-response curves to the right, while SSocta had no effect. The antagonism of BME was competitive on duodenal but not competitive on fundic muscle. We conclude that the direct myogenic action of GRP-10 and NMB in the esophagus is mediated mainly via NMB-preferring receptors, while GRP-preferring receptors are responsible for the contractile responses to bombesin-like peptides in feline fundus and duodenum. Our data suggest that the GRP receptor population located on fundic muscle might be nonhomogeneous.

TI  - The anti-proliferative effect of suramin towards tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant human breast cancer cell lines in relation to expression of receptors for epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I: growth stimulation in the presence of tamoxifen.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen therapy relapse during treatment following acquisition of tamoxifen-resistant or oestrogen-independent phenotypes. The mechanism behind this rapid progression to oestrogen autonomy is at present unclear and further treatment modalities are limited. Suramin represents a novel potential second line therapy. The mechanism of the antineoplastic activity of suramin is not completely understood, although the drug binds to many growth factors including epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factors and can also dissociate growth factors from their receptors. In this study we have related suramin sensitivity to the expression of receptors for epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I in a number of breast cancer cell lines including lines resistant to tamoxifen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-proliferative effects of suramin were investigated in two oestrogen dependent breast cancer lines (ZR-75-1 and MCF-7), oestrogen independent (ZR-PR-LT) and tamoxifen resistant (ZR-75-9a1) variants of ZR-75-1 and a tamoxifen resistant (LY2) variant of MCF-7. Full dose response curves were constructed and IC50 values determined for each cell line. Sensitivity to suramin was correlated with the level of expression of receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGFR). On observing stimulation of cell proliferation by suramin in the tamoxifen resistant cell lines in the presence of tamoxifen we also investigated the possible role of suramin sequestration of transforming growth factor-beta in mediating this effect. RESULTS: All cell lines exhibited a dose- and time-dependent response to suramin treatment. Tamoxifen resistant ZR-75-9a1 cells (day 6 IC50 85 micrograms ml-1) were more resistant to suramin than oestrogen independent ZR-PR-LT cells (day 6 IC50 45 micrograms ml-1), and the parent ZR-75-1 line (day 6 IC50 56 micrograms ml-1). Increased sensitivity to suramin was associated with increased expression of IGFR and decreased expression of EGFR. Tamoxifen resistant LY2 cells were significantly more sensitive to suramin (day 6 IC50 70 micrograms ml-1) than MCF-7 cells (day 6 IC50 350 micrograms ml-1). Both IGFR and EGFR expression by LY2 cells was lower than in the parent line. The antioestrogen-resistant ZR-75-9a1 and LY2 lines grown in the presence of 8 microM tamoxifen were growth stimulated by concentrations of the drug below 100 micrograms/ml. As growth stimulation observed in the presence of tamoxifen may have been due to suramin sequestration of tamoxifen induced TGF-beta 1 secretion we also investigated the response of the cells to this peptide in the presence and absence of suramin. All cell lines were growth inhibited by TGF-beta 1 except ZR-75-9a1 which was unresponsive. Responses to TGF-beta 1 were modified in the presence of 100 micrograms suramin ml-1 although TGF-beta 1 was unable to mimic the ability of tamoxifen to stimulate proliferation in the presence of suramin. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that for ZR-75-1 cells and variants, increased sensitivity to suramin is associated with an increase in expression of IGFR and a decrease in EGFR numbers. However, tamoxifen resistant LY2 cells, in which both IGFR and EGFR expression is reduced were considerably more sensitive than parental MCF-7 cells suggesting that there is no clear relationship between EGFR and IGFR expression and suramin sensitivity. The unexpected stimulation of cell proliferation of the tamoxifen resistant variants by suramin in the presence of tamoxifen could not be explained by suramin sequestration of transforming growth factor-beta and the mechanism of this interaction remains uncle

TI  - Context reinforcement degrades discriminative control: a memory approach.  
AB  - This study measured effects of context reinforcement on a visual discrimination. Five pigeons responded to 1 key in the presence of 6 shorter wavelengths and to another key for 6 longer wavelengths. Psychometric functions provided measures of discriminative sensitivity (d') and overall stimulus control. Sensitivity and control were slightly but significantly better when 20% of correct choices yielded reinforcement than when 5% did. Reinforcement of pecks to the sample stimulus reduced control substantially and sensitivity slightly; noncontingent reinforcement during intertrial intervals also reduced control, whether such reinforcement was signaled or not. Accuracy was excellent during an extinction session, but it fell substantially when reinforcement for sample pecks was added during choice extinction. Simulations based on a memory model of the discrimination process reproduced most of the experimental findings.

TI  - Mechanical sensitivity of muscle afferents in a nerve treated with colchicine.  
AB  - The experiments reported here demonstrate that the mechanical sensitivity of peripheral nerve fibres typically seen after injury can be induced without overtly injuring the nerve, but by simply applying colchicine topically to the nerve. In cats anaesthetised with pentobarbitone sodium, the medial gastrocnemius nerve was exposed and 10 mM colchicine applied topically for 15 min. The animals recovered from the operation normally and showed no subsequent motor deficit. Six days later animals were re-anaesthetised, a laminectomy carried out and responses recorded in single afferents at the level of the dorsal root. It was found that many afferents, particularly those with conduction velocities in the group II-III range, had become sensitive to local mechanical stimulation of the nerve in the region treated with colchicine and showed slowly adapting responses to stretch of the nerve. Many of the smaller fibres exhibited spontaneous activity. Mechanically sensitive afferents exhibited impulse conduction blocks at the colchicine-treated site. Some afferents, which appeared to conduct impulses normally through the treated region, were associated with muscle receptors having normal response properties. However, other muscle receptors were clearly abnormal and were insensitive to muscle stretch or contraction or exhibited only phasic responses. When the nerve was cut proximal to the colchicine-treated site, some, but not all, spontaneous activity was abolished. It was subsequently shown using a collision technique that the activity in some axons had its origin in the cell body in the dorsal root ganglion. In one experiment, it was shown that after nerve section proximal to the colchicine-treated region three of five axons switched their activity from a peripheral to a central origin. It is postulated that colchicine disrupts fast axonal transport of mechanically sensitive or voltage-sensitive ion channels, from the cell body to the peripheral terminals of the axons, leading to an accumulation of these channels at the treated site. This induces mechanical sensitivity and spontaneous activity. It is postulated that interruption of a retrogradely transported signal induces the spontaneous activity in the cell body. These experiments suggest that an important influence is exerted by the cell body on the peripheral terminals of mechanoreceptors to confer on them their normal response properties.

TI  - Phosphorylation of a twitchin-related protein controls catch and calcium sensitivity of force production in invertebrate smooth muscle.  
AB  - "Catch" is a condition of prolonged, high-force maintenance at resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) and very low energy usage, occurring in invertebrate smooth muscles, including the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus edulis. Relaxation from catch is rapid on serotonergic nerve stimulation in intact muscles and application of cAMP in permeabilized muscles. This release of catch occurs by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of a high (approximately 600 kDa) molecular mass protein, the regulator of catch. Here, we identify the catch-regulating protein as a homologue of the mini-titin, twitchin, based on (i) a partial cDNA of the purified isolated protein showing 77% amino acid sequence identity to the kinase domain of Aplysia californica twitchin; (ii) a polyclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide in this sequence reacting with the phosphorylated catch-regulating protein band from permeabilized ABRM; and (iii) the similarity of the amino acid composition and molecular weight of the protein to twitchin. In permeabilized ABRM, at all but maximum [Ca2+], phosphorylation of twitchin results in a decreased calcium sensitivity of force production (half-maximum at 2.5 vs. 1.3 microM calcium). At a given submaximal force, with equal numbers of force generators, twitchin phosphorylation increased unloaded shortening velocity approximately 2-fold. These data suggest that aspects of the catch state exist not only at resting [Ca2+], but also at higher submaximal [Ca2+]. The mechanism that gives rise to force maintenance in catch probably operates together, to some extent, with that of cycling myosin crossbridges.

TI  - Ontogeny of mu opioid agonist anti-nociception in postnatal rats.  
AB  - Mu opiate agonists morphine, fentanyl and meperidine are administered short-term to pediatric patients, from the neonatal period through adolescence. However, there has been no assessment of the effect of age on the analgesic efficacy or the concentration-response relationship for these opioids in human pediatric patients. Few studies in animals have correlated opioid anti-nociception and tissue levels of these opioids commonly administered to pediatric patients. The present study was conducted to examined the role of age on opioid anti-nociceptive potency and efficacy and brain and plasma opioid levels to provide predictive information on the effect of opioids in developing humans. Administration of trace amounts of tritiated drug with anti-nociceptive doses of unlabeled drug was used for the assessment of anti-nociception in the tail-flick test and for the measurement of brain and plasma drug equivalent levels in postnatal rats (PND 3-21). Morphine and fentanyl were completely efficacious in all postnatal ages examined, although age-related differences in drug potency, as well as, differences in brain and plasma levels were observed. There was a good correlation between morphine (r = 0.96) and fentanyl (r = 0.89) ED(50) values and their respective brain and plasma EC(50) equivalent levels. Meperidine had limited efficacy in young rats (PND 3-9) but was completely efficacious in older rats (PND 14-17). However, PND 21 rats experienced tonic-clonic seizures which limited its efficacy to 70% anti-nociception. Our data suggest that pharmacokinetics, the development of the blood-brain barrier and ontogeny of opioid receptor function may play important roles in the sensitivity of postnatal rats to mu receptor agonists.

TI  - Gustatory and food habit changes during the menstrual cycle.  
AB  - Gustatory and food habit changes during the menstrual cycle were studied in 8 women, 6 smokers and 2 non-smokers, aged 23-37 years. The following parameters were evaluated during three consecutive menstrual cycles: blood oestradiol and progesterone levels on the 7th, 14th and 21st day of each cycle (radioimmunoassay); detection and recognition thresholds and concentration preferences for sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid and quinine sulphate on the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st day of each cycle; food consumption (weighed record) on days 1 and 2, 6-8, 13-15 and 20-22 each cycle. The four basic tastes were influenced differently by blood hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Sensitivity to sweet taste increased with an increase of oestradiol, while sensitivity to bitter taste increased with an increase of progesterone. No correlations between hormone levels and acid taste, and only a few correlations for salt taste were found. Food habits changed during the cycle particularly for meat and fruit. Vegetables and cereals showed only a tendency to vary. In correspondence with the highest oestradiol values there was a tendency towards lower energy intake, -122 kcal (-0.51 MJ) = 8%, predominantly provided by carbohydrates (as bread).

TI  - Scintimammographic analysis of nonpalpable breast lesions previously identified by conventional mammography.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: In randomized trials, screening mammography has led to decreased mortality from breast cancer. However, the low positive predictive value of mammography (i.e., the proportion of patients with a positive test result who actually have breast cancer) results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies. We determined whether scintimammography with technetium-99m-sestamibi is a useful supplemental diagnostic tool for women with nonpalpable breast abnormalities identified by conventional mammography. METHODS: Scintimammography was performed preoperatively on 70 women who were 31-66 years of age (mean age and median age = 51 years). These women had nonpalpable breast abnormalities identified by conventional mammography; subsequently, a needle-localization excisional biopsy of each suspicious lesion was performed. Scintimammographic images were interpreted independently by two nuclear medicine physicians who were blinded to all clinical and pathologic data, and an interobserver variation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Interobserver variation analysis of the scintimammographic findings showed an agreement for breast diagnosis of 97% and a kappa coefficient of 0.90. Comparison of scintimammographic findings and histopathologic results revealed that the sensitivity (proportion of patients with breast cancer who had a positive test result), the specificity (proportion of patients without breast cancer who had a negative test result), the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value (proportion of patients with a negative test result who actually did not have breast cancer) of scintimammography were 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 23%-85%), 87% (95% CI = 75%-94%), 38% (95% CI = 15%-68%), and 93% (95% CI = 82%-98%), respectively. Four of nine breast cancers were not detected by scintimammography. CONCLUSION: Because of excellent interobserver agreement, scintimammography provides an objective way of detecting primary breast carcinoma. In view of its low sensitivity and positive predictive value, however, scintimammography is not currently recommended as a screening test in patients with nonpalpable positive mammographic findings.

TI  - [Tumor bladder antigen (TBA). A new method for the diagnosis and detection of recurrence of bladder cancer]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the usefulness and accuracy of the BTA test versus urinary cytology. METHODS: The BTA test was performed in 45 patients distributed into three groups: group I comprised patients with hematuria of unknown origin; group II had a diagnosis of bladder cancer; and group III comprised patients who had undergone TUR for a bladder tumor and were undergoing endoscopic control evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method were determined for each group of patients. RESULTS: The BTA test showed a higher sensitivity than urinary cytology in all groups, the difference being significant for groups II and III. Its specificity, however, was lower than that of cytology in groups I and III, and similar in group II. CONCLUSION: The BTA test is a simple and useful method for the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer. It has a higher sensitivity than urinary cytology, although its specificity is lower due to the higher number of false positives observed in patients with inflammatory bladder conditions. Randomized studies are warranted to determine if the accuracy of urinary cytology can be enhanced with the combined use of the BTA test which has been demonstrated to have a higher specificity.

AB  - A MEDLINE search of the 1996 and 1997 literature yielded two reviews of the methodology of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) in the field of rheumatology and eight original CEAs evaluating slow-acting antirheumatic agents (two studies), total hip arthroplasty for patients with osteoarthritis (one study), educational intervention for patients with fibromyalgia (one study), interventions for patients with low back pain (three studies), and hormone replacement therapy for women with osteoporosis (one study). Most CEAs relied on modelling of data that were assembled from various sources; however, in one CEA a cost-effectiveness comparison was based on data collected prospectively within a randomized clinical trial. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted by a majority of the studies. The CEAs of slow-acting antirheumatic agents provided results that were difficult to interpret given extensive modelling and reliance on expert estimates. Only one CEA was supported by an industry grant. Most of the studies were of high quality and met current methodologic requirements, including the use of discounting, sensitivity analysis, and incremental analysis. However, the major shortcoming of these recent studies continues to be the use of estimated costs instead of prospectively measured resource utilization data presented in terms of separate physical units.

TI  - [Evaluation of coronary artery stenosis with respiratory gated NMR angiography]  
AB  - Respiratory gated MR coronary angiography is a new MR imaging technique which permits reconstruction of the coronary arteries from a three-dimensional data set obtained from contiguous parallel sections. In this study, respiratory gated MR angiography was applied to assess significant coronary artery stenoses (> or = 50%). MR imaging was performed in 68 patients (50 men, 18 women) who had been referred to cardiac catheterization because of suspected or known coronary artery disease. The evaluation of coronary artery stenoses was performed in a blinded manner in the proximal, middle, and distal vessel segments after multiplanar coronary reconstruction of the MR images. Of the 680 coronary segments, 275 (40%) were located outside the imaging volume and were, therefore, excluded from further analysis. The highest sensitivity for stenosis detection was found in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) with 75% and 71%, respectively.  The overall sensitivity, however, was low with 48%. The overall specificity was 92%. The positive and negative predictive values were 67% and 85%, respectively. This study shows that significant coronary artery stenoses, especially in the proximal LAD and RCA, can be correctly identified using respiratory gated MR angiography. However, further technical improvements are necessary before this method may become a reliable diagnostic tool in clinical practice.

The intracellular GSH concentration in human glioblastoma (T98G, U87MG) and glioma (KG1C) cell lines was one or two orders of magnitude higher than that in a human myelogenous leukemic cell line (HL-60), which showed higher sensitivity to H2O2. Pretreatment of these cell lines with L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine, which significantly reduced the intracellular GSH concentration, increased their sensitivity against H2O2, whereas pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, which did not significantly change the intracellular GSH concentration, only marginally protected the cells from the cytotoxic effect of H2O2. The results suggest that drug sensitivity of tumor cells can be modified by glutathione-modulating compounds.

TI  -  The sensitivity of rapid (partial) review of cervical smears.  
AB  - Rapid review involves a daily rapid (e.g. 30 s) review of all smears not normally double-screened. It has been suggested that the method may increase the sensitivity of cervical cytology by identifying abnormalities not reported on initial screening, true false negatives (TFN). Rapid screening is reported to have high sensitivity for cervical neoplasia when used as a preview tool. To be effective, however, in a review mode it must be able to detect TFN. Several studies have found that many TFN result from factors such as low numbers of abnormal cells or subtle expression of diagnostic criteria. Studies on the sensitivity of rapid screening for detecting TFN would therefore provide a more reliable estimate of its value as a review tool. The sensitivity of rapid re-screening was evaluated using a test set of 200 cases. Each of 15 screeners rapidly reviewed (30 s partial screen) the set over a 2-week period. The set consisted of 129 normal, 28 low-grade squamous lesions (CIN I), 37 high-grade lesions (CIN II, III and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)) and six invasive carcinomas. The abnormals included 20 TFN cases. The median sensitivity for abnormalities was 62%. Rapid review was more sensitive for CIN II and CIN III (67%) and invasive carcinoma (66.7%) than for CIN I (53%). Great variation was apparent in the sensitivity for individual screeners, with a range of 41-86% for all abnormalities. The sensitivity for TFN cases varied even more (10-75%, median 35%) and for most screeners was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than for cases which were detected on initial screen (53-90%, median 70.6%). Following this trial rapid review was used routinely for a period of 3 months. In this time 11,413 cases were rapidly reviewed. This led to the full review of 415 slides (3.5%) and the identification of 16 cases of undetected CIN (12 CIN I, three CIN II, one CIN III). Based on current estimates of our laboratory false-negative rate this represents between a quarter and half of the TFN cases of CIN that probably occurred in this period. In conclusion, rapid screening is likely to be significantly less sensitive when used in a review rather than a preview mode. In routine practice the method requires a daily commitment of screener time, but does provide a higher yield of TFN smears than does random review, and allows amendment of these results prior to reporting.

TI  - [Diagnosis of anterior knee instability. Comparison between the Lachman test, the KT-1,000 arthrometer and the ultrasound Lachman test]  
AB  - We reviewed 45 patients on average 14.7 years after surgery for rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. The aim of the study was to compare the reliability of the Lachman test to evaluation of knee laxity with the KT 1000 arthrometer and the ultrasound-assisted Lachman test. Forty-five knees were examined with the Lachman test: 12 knees showed no sign of instability; 20 had a + positive Lachman test with a hard end point; 6 with a + positive test had no end point and were rated as unstable; a +2 Lachman test was found in 7 knees. With the KT 1000 Arthrometer 44 knees were examined: 30 knees were graded as stable according to the criteria of Daniel; 14 knees were unstable. We used the ultrasound-guided Lachman test in 44 knees. Taking only the side-to-side difference into account, 37 knees were stable and 7 unstable. According to Gruber, a single translation greater than 4 mm is also a sign of instability. Therefore, 12 knees were unstable, although 6 of these knees were rated as stable, taking the side-to-side difference into account. Comparing the two instrument measurements, all knees with ultrasound-rated instability on the basis of side-to-side measurements were also rated as unstable with the KT 1000 arthrometer. Only half of the knees rated as unstable because of a single translation greater than 4 mm with the ultrasound technique were rated as unstable with the KT 1000 arthrometer. Our results show that the accuracy of the Lachman test is as good as the instrument evaluation if the end point is taken into consideration. A positive Lachman test indicating anterior knee laxity is one where the soft end point is as described by Torg et al. Both instrument measurements are accurate in indicating anterior knee laxity, but only if they are used by an experienced examiner. Using the side-to-side measurements, the sensitivity of the KT 1000 arthrometer is higher. If only single translations greater than 4 mm without a significant side-to-side difference with the ultrasound technique are interpreted as anterior knee instability, then some knees will be rated as unstable, although both the clinical and KT 1000 arthrometer examinations prove them to be stable. We believe that only a side-to-side difference with the instrument techniques should be interpreted as knee laxity. Borderline positive measurements should only be used together with the clinical findings. Both instrument measurements can help to improve the quality of the clinical examination if the examiners are inexperienced. If instrument measurements are required, we believe that the ultrasound technique is easy and cheap to perform. Nevertheless, we believe that instrument measurements of anterior knee laxity are not necessary if a thorough clinical examination is performed, taking the end point of the Lachman test into consideration.

TI  - Anxiety sensitivity: multiple dimensions and hierarchic structure.  
AB  -  Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is the fear of anxiety-related sensations, based on beliefs that these sensations have harmful consequences. AS is thought to play an important role as a diathesis for anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder. Recent evidence suggests that AS has a hierarchical structure, consisting of multiple lower-order factors, which load on a single higher-order factor. If each factor corresponds to a discrete mechanism, then the results suggest that AS arises from a hierarchic arrangement of mechanisms. A problem with previous studies is that they were based on the 16-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), which may not contain enough items to reveal the type and number of lower-order factors. Accordingly, we developed the 60-item Anxiety Sensitivity Profile, which was administered to 349 university students. Factor analyses revealed four lower-order factors: (1) Fear of respiratory symptoms, (2) fear of cognitive dyscontrol, (3) fear of gastrointestinal symptoms, and (4) fear of cardiac symptoms. These loaded on a single higher-order factor. The lower-order factors shared variance with the higher-order factor, but also contained unique variance. Thus, the results suggest that AS is the product of a general factor, with independent contributions from four specific factors.

RESULTS: Postoperative antibiotic exposure with at least 9 days between the first and last dates of antibiotic administration, excluding the first postoperative day, had a sensitivity of 95% (261/276) and specificity of 85% (3,944/4,628) for identifying surgical-site infection, using as a gold standard surgical-site infections identified by conventional prospective surveillance or extrapolated from review of a sample of medical records. In contrast, using the same gold standard for surgical-site infections, the sensitivity of routine prospective surveillance alone was only 60%. The predictive value positive of the defined antibiotic exposure was 28% (261/945) for surgical-site infection and 60% (563/945) for any nosocomial infection. In the Israeli cohort, the sensitivity was 87% (74/85) and the specificity was 82% (735/898). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic exposure of sufficient duration and timing was more sensitive than conventional methods in detecting nosocomial infection and required substantially less effort to collect. Although the predictive value positive for surgical-site infection was only moderate, the majority of individuals identified this way had a nosocomial infection.

TI  - Cyclin-specific START events and the G1-phase specificity of arrest by mating factor in budding yeast.  
AB  - The START cell cycle transition in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is catalyzed by the Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase associated with Cln-type cyclins. Since ectopic expression of the B-type cyclin CLB5 can efficiently rescue the inviability that results from CLN depletion, we tested the specificity of the CLN and CLB classes of cyclins for promoting START-associated events. Several aspects of the regulation of the mating factor response were compared for cells in which START activity was provided by either Cln-cyclins or Clb5. Unlike Cln1 and Cln2, high level expression of Clb5 was unable to repress the activity of the mating factor response pathway at START. Downregulation of Far1 protein at START is normal in cln- GAL1::CLB5 cells. Even though the Clb5-Cdc28 kinase activity in cln- GAL1::CLB5 cells is not downregulated in response to mating factor, cells arrest in the first cycle after addition of mating factor with a similar sensitivity as wild-type cells. However, whereas wild-type cells treated with mating factor arrest specifically in G1 phase as unbudded cells with unreplicated DNA (pre-START), most cln- GAL1::CLB5 cells arrest as budded post-START cells with replicated DNA. Our findings demonstrate the ability of post-START cells to arrest in response to mating factor and provide novel evidence for mechanisms that contribute to restrict mating factor-induced arrest in wild-type cells to the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

TI  - Salt sensitivity is associated with insulin resistance in essential hypertension.  
AB  - The relationship between salt sensitivity and insulin resistance was investigated in nondiabetic, nonobese (body mass index < or = 28) untreated patients with uncomplicated, mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Alterations in insulin-mediated glucose disposal were assessed by means of the insulin suppression test. Subjects were classified as salt sensitive and salt resistant according to their blood pressure response to low and high salt intake. Fasting serum glucose levels were within normal limits and did not differ between salt sensitive and salt resistant hypertensives, irrespectively of the level of salt intake. Fasting serum insulin levels increased in salt sensitive patients when on a high intake of salt. The insulin suppression test revealed the existence of marked differences in insulin-mediated glucose uptake between salt sensitive and salt resistant hypertensives. Much higher steady-state glucose values (nanomoles of glucose/ liter) were obtained during the insulin suppression test in salt sensitive than in salt-resistant hypertensives (7.4+/-1.6 v 3.5+/-0.1 under low salt; and 12.5+/-1.1 v 4.3+/-0.1 under high salt intake). The product of glucose times insulin obtained at steady state during low and high salt intakes were 2.5 and 5 times greater, respectively, in salt sensitive than in salt resistant hypertensives. Therefore, the impairment in insulin-mediated glucose disposal observed in salt sensitive hypertensives was present both under low salt (60 to 70 mEq/day) and high salt intake (300 mEq/day). However, it was exacerbated under high salt intake. These results suggest that untreated salt sensitive hypertensives have a considerable impairment in insulin-mediated glucose disposal because of a state of insulin resistance. High salt intake increased BP, induced hyperinsulinemia, and worsened insulin-mediated glucose disposal only in salt sensitive patients. We propose that salt sensitivity contributes, separately from hypertension, to insulin resistance and thus be considered per se as an additional risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. Salt sensitivity and insulin resistance may be genetically associated conditions.

TI  - The characterization of a commercial MOSFET dosimeter system for use in diagnostic x ray.  
AB  - A commercial patient dose verification system utilizing non-invasive metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters originally designed for radiotherapy applications has been evaluated for use at diagnostic energy levels. The system features multiple dosimeters that may be used to monitor entrance or exit skin dose and intracavity doses in phantoms in real time. We have characterized both the standard MOSFET dosimeter designed for radiotherapy dose verification and a newly developed "high sensitivity" MOSFET dosimeter designed for lower dose measurements. The sensitivity, linearity, angular response, post-exposure response, and physical characteristics were evaluated. The average sensitivity (free in air, including backscatter) of the radiotherapy MOSFET dosimeters ranged from 3.55 x 10(4) mV per C kg(-1) (9.2 mV R(-1)) to 4.87 x 10(4) mV per C kg(-1) (12.6 mV R(-1)) depending on the energy of the x-ray field.  The sensitivity of the "high sensitivity" MOSFET dosimeters ranged from 1.15 x 10(5) mV per C kg(-1) (29.7 mV R(-1)) to 1.38 x 10(5) mV per C kg(-1) (35.7 mV R(-1)) depending on the energy of the x-ray field. The high sensitivity dosimeters demonstrated excellent linearity at high energies (90 and 120 kVp) and acceptable linearity at lower energies (60 kVp). The angular response was significant for free-in-air exposures, as illustrated by the sensitivity differences between the two sides of the dosimeter, but was excellent for measurements within a tissue equivalent cylinder. The post-exposure drift response is a complicated but reproducible function of time. Real-time monitoring requires little if any corrections for the post-exposure drift response. The MOSFET dosimeter system brings some unique capabilities to diagnostic radiology dosimetry including small size, real-time capabilities, nondestructive measurement, good linearity, and a predictable angular response.

TI  - Basic FGF-responsive telencephalic precursor cells express functional GABA(A) receptor/Cl-channels in vitro.  
AB  - We have previously described the expression of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor subunits and their transcripts in the cortical neuroepithelium (Ma and Barker, 1995, 1998). However, it is not clear whether neural precursor cells exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in vitro reproduce the biological properties of neuroepithelial cells in vivo within the embryonic ventricular zone. In the present study, neural precursor cells were isolated from the telencephalic neuroepithelium of embryonic day 13-13.5 rats and exposed to bFGF in serum-free medium. Basic FGF-responsive cells were capable of dividing and differentiating into neurons and astrocytes. The rapidly dividing cells formed multicellular spheres and then a rosette-like formation in which a majority of cells expressed GABA(A) receptor alpha4, beta1, or gamma1 subunit proteins. We found in perforated patch-clamp recordings that GABA depolarized bromodeoxyundine (BrdU)+ precursor cells, and under voltage-clamp induced a bicuculline-sensitive current that reversed at the Cl- equilibrium potential. GABA also increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ in a significant number of BrdU+ cells that was blocked by bicuculline.  The bicuculline sensitivity of these pharmacological effects implicates GABA(A) receptor/Cl- channels, since bicuculline is a competitive GABA(A) antagonist at these channels in well-differentiated cells. It is possible that the three GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha4, beta1, and gamma1) found in precursor cells form the Cl- channels detected electrophysiologically. The functional GABA(A) receptor/Cl- channels and associated regulation of their cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via bicuculline-sensitive mechanisms may play significant roles in the regulation of neural cell proliferation in this model neuroepithelium.

TI  - Isolation and initial characterization of the uridine phosphorylase from Salmonella typhimurium.  
AB  - The structural udp gene encoding uridine phosphorylase (UPase) was cloned from the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome and overexpressed in E. coli cells. The S. typhimurium UPase was purified to an apparently homogeneous state, and some physicochemical characteristics of the enzyme were studied. The molecular weight of one subunit of UPase is 27.5 kD, and the optimal pH for its activity is 7.2--7.4. The native S. typhimurium UPase consists of six identical subunits, and its molecular weight is about 165 kD. According to these parameters, the S. typhimurium UPase is similar to the E. coli UPase. However, these enzymes differ substantially from one another by the substrate sensitivity and sensitivity to polarity of the medium. The S. typhimurium UPase has much higher phosphorylation activity toward thymidine, deoxyuridine, and 5;-bromide- or 5;-fluoride-containing analogs of nucleosides than that of E. coli UPase.

TI  - Unc-1: a stomatin homologue controls sensitivity to volatile anesthetics in Caenorhabditis elegans.  
AB  - To identify sites of action of volatile anesthetics, we are studying genes in a functional pathway that controls sensitivity to volatile anesthetics in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The unc-1 gene occupies a central position in this pathway. Different alleles of unc-1 have unique effects on sensitivity to the different volatile anesthetics. UNC-1 shows extensive homology to human stomatin, an integral membrane protein thought to regulate an associated ion channel. We postulate that UNC-1 has a direct effect on anesthetic sensitivity in C. elegans and may represent a molecular target for volatile anesthetics.

TI  - Validity of new immunological human fecal hemoglobin and albumin tests in detecting colorectal neoplasms--an endoscopy-controlled study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for occult blood by means of guaiac tests has an unsatisfactory sensitivity for the detection of colorectal neoplasms. To increase sensitivity and specificity the immunological determination of human hemoglobin and albumin in feces has been developed. The validity of analyzing only two samples from one bowel movement of either test is not known. METHODS: An immunological determination of human fecal hemoglobin and albumin using luminescence immunoassays (LIA) was performed in 739 patients with gastrointestinal complaints before scheduled colonoscopy. Each patient collected two 1 ml samples from one stool. There were no dietary restrictions. RESULTS: The sensitivity for detecting colorectal carcinomas was 95.3% (95% confidence interval 84.2-99.4%) with hemoglobin and 67.4% (95% confidence interval 51.2-80.9%) with albumin.  The sensitivity for detecting large adenomatous polyps was 62.9% (95% confidence interval 50.5-74.1%) with hemoglobin and 32.9% (95% confidence interval 22.1-45.1%) with albumin. The specificity was 97% for hemoglobin, 96% for albumin and 94% for the combined test. CONCLUSIONS: The immunological determination of fecal hemoglobin is superior to albumin and has a better sensitivity for the detection of colorectal neoplasms than that reported for guaiac tests, even if two samples from one bowel movement are examined. The immunological determination of fecal hemoglobin should therefore be evaluated for use in colorectal cancer screening.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis in neonates referred for surgery, and to test whether a prenatal versus postnatal diagnosis influenced mode of delivery and neonatal outcome of these infants. PATIENTS: Thirty-six consecutive neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, abdominal wall defects, bladder exstrophy and meningomyelocele were included. RESULTS: The sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound for diagnosis of the congenital malformations was 7/36 (19%) at 17-18th week of gestation, and overall 13/36 (36%). Overall sensitivity was 2/8 in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 6/12 in neonates with abdominal wall defects, 5/13 in neonates with meningomyelocele, whereas none of three cases with bladder exstrophy were detected prenatally. No significant improvement in neonatal morbidity was found comparing the prenatally and postnatally diagnosed groups. The neonatal survival rate was 10/13 (77%) in the prenatally diagnosed group and 22/23 (96%) in the postnatally diagnosed group (p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound in diagnosing the congenital malformations under study in a low risk population was 19% at 17-18th week of gestation and 36% throughout the pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis altered management of labor, but caused no improvement in neonatal outcome.

TI  - Bone scintigraphy in non-neoplastic diseases in children.  
AB  - Since the introduction of 99mTc labeled polyphosphates bone scintigraphy has become a widely accepted method for the evaluation of non-neoplastic bone diseases in children. High quality images require the child's immobilisation and a correct positioning as well as an optimized technical equipment. Two or three phase scintigraphy is the routinely procedure but additional techniques like pinhole images or SPECT can be very helpful for special indications and localisations. Due to the age and sex dependent differences of bone metabolism in the developing skeleton the interpretation of the bone scan in children is more difficult than in adults and requires more experience. Infections, trauma and aseptic necrosis are the most important non-neoplastic diseases requiring bone scintigraphy. Bone scan has a high sensitivity in the early detection of pathological bone metabolism indicating bone disease; other investigations, which are describing morphological changes like X-ray are less sensitive especially at the beginning of the disease. Negative bone scan rools out significant bone disorders with a high certainty. Follow-up studies can give additional informations about the response to therapeutical regimes and about the prognosis. To improve the specificity of a bone scan a combined interpretation of scintigraphy and X-ray is recommended.

TI  - The association between vasectomy and prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible association between vasectomy and prostate cancer. DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. PATIENT(S): Fourteen original studies published between January 1985 and December 1996 that addressed the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The strength of the association was estimated with the use of a meta-analysis (DerSimonian and Laird method).  A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of different sources of heterogeneity. RESULT(S): Fourteen original papers were reviewed (5 cohort and 9 case-control studies). Relative risks ranged between 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-4.0) and 6.70 (95% CI = 2.1-21.6). The overall relative risk (DerSimonian and Laird estimate) was 1.23 (95% CI = 1.01-1.49). The sensitivity analysis showed that this measure was very sensitive to the study base, the type of design used, and the possibility of bias. Further, the funnel plot demonstrated the probable existence of publication bias. CONCLUSION(S): No causal association was found between vasectomy and prostate cancer. Individuals who have undergone vasectomy are not at high risk for the development of prostate cancer.

TI  - Biomechanical and neurophysiological studies on audition in eared and earless harlequin frogs (Atelopus).  
AB  - Tissue displacement of various body surfaces and the auditory midbrain sensitivities to sound were measured in Atelopus species with or without a tympanic middle ear ("eared" and "earless", respectively). Tissue displacement (vibration) of body regions was measured by laser Doppler vibrometer. The body wall directly overlying the lung is most dramatically displaced by sound pressure in all species tested. The otic (lateral head) region showed low displacement in earless species, but significant displacement to high-frequency sound in eared species. Peak tissue displacement of the body wall occurred within the frequency range of each species' advertisement vocalization. Peak tissue displacement of the otic region of the eared species also occurred within these frequencies. Multi-unit neurophysiological recordings of the auditory midbrain (torus semicircularis) also were obtained. Auditory sensitivity curves showed three distinct regions of sensitivity at low, middle, and high frequencies, the latter located within the frequency range of each species' advertisement vocalization. The correlation between auditory midbrain sensitivity and tissue displacement of the body wall region at advertisement vocalization frequencies, suggests that the body wall/lungs serve as the route of sound transfer to the inner ear in earless species and possibly in the eared species as well.

TI  - Utility of a rapid fecal latex agglutination test detecting the neutrophil protein, lactoferrin, for diagnosing inflammatory causes of chronic diarrhea.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The utility of tests for fecal neutrophils in the setting of chronic diarrhea has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of chronic diarrhea associated with fecal neutrophils. METHODS: One fecal specimen from each of 10 normal subjects, 26 patients with known microscopic colitis, 13 with celiac sprue, eight with Crohn's disease, four with ulcerative colitis, and 103 with chronic diarrhea of unknown origin, as well as 10 fecal specimens from a patient with chronic nongranulomatous enterocolitis were analyzed blindly for the presence of a neutrophil granule protein called lactoferrin using a commercial latex agglutination kit. Diagnostic evaluation of the 103 patients with chronic diarrhea was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of this test for chronic inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: None of the normal control subjects, three of 39 patients with microscopic colitis or celiac sprue, all 10 specimens from the patient with enterocolitis, and all 12 control patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had a positive fecal lactoferrin test. Eleven of 103 patients with chronic diarrhea presenting without a diagnosis had a positive test, and all were diagnosed with an inflammatory condition of the colon (five-, ulcerative colitis; four-, Crohn's disease; one-, ischemic colitis; and one-, microscopic colitis). Only one patient with inflammatory bowel disease had a negative lactoferrin test.  The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the fecal lactoferrin test for ulcerative or Crohn's colitis were 90%, 98%, 82%, and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The major cause of fecal neutrophils in patients with chronic diarrhea is chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon. The latex agglutination test for fecal lactoferrin offers a highly sensitive, specific, and simple means for detection of fecal neutrophils in these patients.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in body composition and energy balance in lean women with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in energy expenditure and body composition in relationship to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in women with normal and abnormal glucose metabolism. We hypothesized that women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception would have less fat accretion and smaller increases in energy expenditure. STUDY DESIGN: Six women with normal glucose tolerance and 10 women with abnormal glucose tolerance were evaluated before conception, and in early (12 to 14 weeks) and late (34 to 36 weeks) gestation. Body composition was estimated by hydrodensitometry, resting energy expenditure, and glucose and fat metabolism by indirect calorimetry, endogenous glucose production by infusion of [6-6 2H2] glucose, and insulin sensitivity using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min). RESULTS: There was a smaller increase in fat mass (1.3 kg [P = .04]) in early pregnancy in women with abnormal glucose tolerance before pregnancy. Indirect calorimetry measured gestational age-related increases in basal oxygen utilization, with or without correction for fat-free mass (VO2, P = .002), resting energy expenditure (expressed in kilocalories, P = .0001), and carbohydrate oxidation (P = .0003). The insulin-mediated elevation in VO2 increased in later gestation VO2 (P = .005), as did resting energy expenditure (P = .0001) and fat oxidation (P = 0.0001). However, there was a decrease in respiratory quotient (P = .0001), carbohydrate oxidation (P = .002), and nonoxidative carbohydrate metabolism (P = .0001) with advancing gestation during insulin infusion. In early pregnancy, changes in fat mass correlated inversely with changes in insulin sensitivity (r= -0.52, P = .04) and changes in basal VO2 correlated inversely with decreases in basal endogenous glucose production (r = -0.74, P = .01). CONCLUSION: In early gestation, the changes in maternal fat mass and basal oxygen consumption are inversely related to the changes in insulin sensitivity. This response in lean women with decreased insulin sensitivity before conception may have survival value by providing a larger amount of available substrate to meet fetoplacental needs during gestation.

AB  - Multicentric breast cancer is one of the most important contraindications for breast conserving therapy. While the sensitivity of mammography decreases in the dense breast, the present study was designed to assess the efficacy of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of multicentric breast cancer compared to clinical examination, mammography and sonography. In 38 of 46 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy, multicentric breast cancer was found histologically according to the definition of Holland et al The sensitivity for the diagnosis of multicentricity in breast cancer was as follows: palpation (47%), mammography (66%), sonography (79%) and MRI (89%). While MRI had the highest sensitivity, the specificity was the lowest showing 8 false positive enhancements (proliferative fibroadenomas, fibrocystic disease and papilloma). Compared to the other methods, MRI assessed the multicentric extent of breast cancer with the highest sensitivity which appears most important in radiodense breasts when breast conserving therapy is planned.

TI  - Leukemic cellular retinoic acid resistance and missense mutations in the PML-RARalpha fusion gene after relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia from treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and intensive chemotherapy.  
AB  - This study evaluated whether relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients from clinical remissions achieved and/or maintained with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in combination with intensive chemotherapy is associated with leukemic cellular resistance to RA and with alterations in the PML-RARalpha fusion gene. We studied matched pretreatment and relapse specimens from 12 patients who received variable amounts of RA, primarily in nonconcurrent combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) protocol E2491, and from 8 patients who received DA only on protocol E2491. Of 10 RA-treated patients evaluable for a change in APL cell sensitivity to RA-induced differentiation in vitro, 8 showed diminished sensitivity at relapse, whereas, of 6 evaluable patients treated with DA alone, only 1 had marginally reduced sensitivity. From analysis of sequences encoding the principal functional domains of the PML and RARalpha portions of PML-RARalpha, we found missense mutations in relapse specimens from 3 of 12 RA-treated patients and 0 of 8 DA-treated patients. All 3 mutations were located in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the RARalpha region of PML-RARalpha. Relative to normal RARalpha1, the mutations were Leu290Val, Arg394Trp, and Met413Thr. All pretreatment analyses were normal except for a C to T base change in the 3'-untranslated (UT) region of 1 patient that was also present after relapse from DA therapy. No mutations were detected in the corresponding sequences of the normal RARalpha or PML (partial) alleles. Minor additional PML-RARalpha isoforms encoding truncated PML proteins were detected in 2 cases. We conclude that APL cellular resistance occurs with high incidence after relapse from RA + DA therapy administered in a nonconcurrent manner and that mutations in the RARalpha region of the PML-RARalpha gene are present in and likely mechanistically involved in RA resistance in a subset of these cases.

TI  - Ion tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) is improved by mutations in URE2 or PMA1.  
AB  - Calcineurin is a conserved, Ca2+/CaM-stimulated protein phosphatase required for Ca2+-dependent signaling in many cell types. In yeast, calcineurin is essential for growth in high concentrations of Na+, Li+, Mn2+, and OH-, and for maintaining viability during prolonged treatment with mating pheromone. In contrast, the growth of calcineurin-mutant yeast is better than that of wild-type cells in the presence of high concentrations of Ca2+. We identified mutations that suppress multiple growth defects of calcineurin-deficient yeast (cnb1Delta or cna1Delta cna2Delta). Mutations in URE2 suppress the sensitivity of calcineurin mutants to Na+, Li+, and Mn2+, and increase their survival during treatment with mating pheromone. ure2 mutations require both the transcription factor Gln3p and the Na+ ATPase Pmr2p to confer Na+ and Li+ tolerance. Mutations in PMA1, which encodes the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, also suppress many growth defects of calcineurin mutants. pma1 mutants display growth phenotypes that are opposite to those of calcineurin mutants; they are resistant to Na+, Li+, and Mn2+, and sensitive to Ca2+. We also show that calcineurin mutants are sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics such as hygromycin B while pma1 mutants are more resistant than wild type. Furthermore, pma1 and calcineurin mutations have antagonistic effects on intracellular [Na+] and [Ca2+]. Finally, we show that yeast expressing a constitutively active allele of calcineurin display pma1-like phenotypes, and that membranes from these yeast have decreased levels of Pma1p activity. These studies further characterize the roles that URE2 and PMA1 play in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis.

TI  - Comparison of diagnostic methods for detection of active infection with Tritrichomonas foetus in beef heifers.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare sensitivity of a generic trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium versus a commercial nutrient medium in the diagnosis of Tritrichomonas foetus infection in heifers and to assess sensitivity when incubation of samples inoculated into commercial medium pouches is delayed overnight. DESIGN: Prospective study. ANIMALS: 30 virgin beef heifers. PROCEDURES: 20 heifers vaccinated with a trichomonad antigen and 10 unvaccinated control heifers were exposed at synchronized estrus by intravaginal instillation of 10(6) T foetus organisms. Cervicovaginal mucus samples were collected every other week for 10 weeks from controls and once (10 weeks after exposure) from vaccinated heifers. Samples were inoculated into both media and immediately incubated at 37 C (98.6 F). A duplicate inoculation from controls was made into commercial medium, and the pouch was shipped overnight to a diagnostic laboratory without prior incubation. RESULTS: For 40 of 50 samples from control heifers, there was agreement on diagnoses between media. There was agreement on a positive diagnosis for 3 of 20 samples from vaccinated heifers and on a negative diagnosis for 15 of these 20 samples. For samples shipped overnight before incubation, there were 10% fewer positive diagnoses, compared with samples incubated immediately in commercial medium and 10% more positive diagnoses, compared with samples immediately incubated in TYM. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of the commercial medium is a more sensitive indicator of current infection in heifers than use of generic TYM medium. In herds where infection prevalence is high, this method is likely to identify more infected females, an important consideration when control programs include culling of infected cows.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria for fatty infiltration of the liver on contrast-enhanced helical CT.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to develop quantitative and qualitative criteria for diagnosing fatty liver on contrast-enhanced helical CT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Differential liver-spleen attenuation was evaluated between 80 and 120 sec after injection in 76 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced helical CT. Unenhanced CT images had earlier established fatty liver when the liver minus spleen attenuation difference was less than or equal to -10 H (n = 18). Four observers who had not seen the unenhanced images used contrast-enhanced CT images to assess the presence of fatty liver on a five-point Likert scale, the presence of geographic areas spared from fatty infiltration, and the relative liver-spleen attenuation. The diagnostic accuracies of various imaging criteria were compared using McNemar's chi-square test (for sensitivity and specificity) and analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve areas for observers' qualitative judgments were 54%, 95%, and .91, respectively; for quantitative differential liver-spleen attenuation (80-100 sec; -20.5 H discriminatory value), the values were 86%, 87%, and .94, respectively; and for quantitative differential liver-spleen attenuation (101-120 sec; -18.5 H discriminatory value), the values were 93%, 93%, and .98, respectively. Differential liver-spleen attenuation was time-dependent; overlap was noted between healthy subjects and patients with fatty liver. Qualitatively, geographic sparing was highly specific (94%) for fatty liver, whereas liver attenuation greater than or equal to spleen attenuation excluded fatty liver in all but one case. CONCLUSION: Although quantitative and qualitative criteria for diagnosing fatty liver on helical CT can be determined, they are protocol-specific. Limited unenhanced hepatic CT remains the optimal technique for detection of fatty infiltration of the liver.

TI  - Magnetic resonance diagnosis of the anterior labrum and capsule. Effect of field strength on efficacy.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors compare the performance of high-field and low-field magnetic resonance (MR) systems in the evaluation of shoulder instability, 35 patients were examined at field strengths of 1.0 T and of 0.2 T. METHODS: Surface coils were used in both systems. Because arthroscopy was used as gold standard, a preselected patient-population was obtained for the study. RESULTS: The sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of MR images acquired at 1.0 T for labrum pathology were 91%/67%/91% and 70%/80%/71% for the capsular complex. Compared with the above, the sensitivity/specificity/accuracy for 0.2 T MR images revealed 91%/67%/91% for the labrum pathology and 63%/80%/66% for the capsular complex respectively. In the evaluation of capsular lesions a comparison between the 0.2 T MR system and the 1.0 T system indicated a higher sensitivity and accuracy for the high-field images. Concerning labral lesions, the sensitivity and accuracy of the 0.2 T MR imager and the 1.0 T imager were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Given differences in imaging protocols, imaging at 0.2 T does not adversely affect the assessment of shoulder instability when compared with imaging at 1.0 T. These preliminary results warrant more extensive clinical comparison of results obtained at different magnetic field strengths.

TI  - Intracellular calcium enhances the ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors through an interaction with the C0 domain of the NR1 subunit.  
AB  - Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that the ethanol inhibition of recombinant NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes is subunit-dependent, with the NR1/2A receptor being more sensitive than NR1/2C receptors. The ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors is reduced by substitution of the wild-type NR1-1a (NR1(011)) subunit with the calcium-impermeable NR1 (N616R) subunit. In the present study, the ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors was determined under different conditions to examine the role that calcium plays in determining the ethanol sensitivity of recombinant NMDA receptors. The ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2B or NR1/2C receptors was not affected by alterations in extracellular calcium levels or by coexpression with calcium-impermeable NR1 mutants. In contrast, the inhibition of NR1/2A receptors by 100 mM ethanol was reduced in divalent-free recording medium and was significantly increased when 10 mM calcium was used as the only charge carrier. The increase in the ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors under high-calcium conditions was prevented by preinjection of oocytes with the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) but not by inhibitors of calmodulin or protein kinase C. Ethanol did not alter the channel blocking activity of divalent cations on NMDA-induced currents. The enhanced ethanol sensitivity of NR1/2A receptors in 10 mM calcium persisted when the NR1 subunit was replaced by the alternative splice variant NR1-4a (NR1(000)), which lacks the C1 and C2 cassettes. However, expression of a mutant NR1 subunit that lacked the C0, C1, and C2 domains abolished the calcium-dependent enhancement of ethanol's inhibition of NR1/2A receptors. Finally, the ethanol sensitivity of wild-type NR1/2A receptors measured in transfected HEK 293 cells by whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was significantly reduced by expression of the C-terminal truncated NR1 subunit. These results demonstrate that the ethanol sensitivity of certain NMDA receptors is modulated by an intracellular, calcium-dependent process that requires the C0 domain of the NR1 subunit.

TI  - [Indices of prediction of neurologic focality during carotid endarterectomy carried out under regional anesthesia]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relations between the development of neurologic events and the following variables: degree of stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery, prior neurologic symptoms and stump pressure of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under regional anesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We undertook a prospective study of 92 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with a blockade of the superficial and deep cervical plexus. Neurological integrity was assessed and internal carotid artery stump pressure was monitored. Contralateral carotid artery stenosis and neurologic disease present before surgery were studied. RESULTS: Neurologic events developed when the carotid artery was clamped in 9.7% of patients. Mean stump pressure was significantly lower in symptomatic patients (43 +/- 11 mmHg) than in asymptomatic patients (74.6 +/- 24 mmHg) (p < 0.001). Neurologic symptoms developed during clamping of the carotid in 27.2% of the patients with stump pressure less than or equal to 50 mmHg, but in only 4.2% of those with stump pressure surpassing 50 mmHg. Stump pressure was significantly lower in patients with contralateral carotid stenosis. The incidence of neurologic events during clamping was unrelated to contralateral carotid condition, however. Likewise, neurologic symptoms before surgery was also unrelated. In six of the nine patients with neurologic events, internal carotid stump pressure was less than or equal to 50 mmHg, indicating that the sensitivity of this parameter to the development of neurologic events in our series was 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Although internal carotid artery stump pressure identifies a subset of patients likely to have a higher incidence of neurologic events during carotid artery clamping, it can not be considered the only criterion for placement of an intraluminal shunt to prevent such events. The state of the contralateral carotid artery and preexisting neurologic symptoms are not objective screening criteria for identifying patients at high risk of neurologic events during carotid clamping.

TI  - Analytical performance of Elecsys 2010--a multicentre evaluation.  
AB  - The analytical performance of Elecsys 2010 has been assessed in a multicentre evaluation, which involved twelve laboratories from eight countries worldwide. Eleven alanytes (TSH, T4, FT4, T3, FT3, T-up, TNT, CK-MB, HCG, CEA and PSA) were tested using a protocol related to the ECCLS guidelines and the Standard Operating Procedures of the manufacturer. The evaluation was supported by a "Computer Aided Evaluation" (CAEv) program system and telecommunications. Within-run and between-day imprecision for the various analytes with 3% CV and 3 to 8% CV, resp. was comparable to homogeneous immunoassays e.g. for specific proteins on clinical chemistry analysers.  The functional sensitivity for TSH, TNT and PSA was met by low concentrations: < 0.02 microIU/ml TSH, < 0.05 ng/ml TNT and < 0.07 ng/ml PSA. TSH is an assay of the third generation according to the recommendation of Spencer. The measured lower detection limit was less or equal to the manufacturer's specifications with the exception of the PSA assay. Drift effects (over eight hours) and signal carry-over effects were not observed. A high-dose hook effect became relevant for concentrations higher than 430,000 IU/HCG--an assay with a dynamic range of 10,000 IU/I. The Elecsys assays showed a high dynamic range and rarely necessary predilutions could be performed by the Elecsys instrument using the Elecsys multidiluent. Endogenous interferences were not observed. Calibration stability was confirmed for one week and data indicated that it could be extended at least for three weeks. The quality assurance experiment showed a good transferability of the results between the participating laboratories. The assigned values of two interlaboratory survey materials were found for most of the analytes within a deviation of +/- 10%. Higher deviations could be explained by differences in standardization and methods. The Elecsys 2010 system offers a high analytical sensitivity in combination with relatively low sample volumes and short measuring times (< or = 18 minutes); a high dynamic measuring range reduces the number of reruns and makes the work-flow more convenient. The electrochemiluninescence technology of Elecsys 2010 shows advantages in system performance without having any drawbacks compared to existing technologies.

TI  - Oral aluminum administration to rats wih normal renal function. 1. Impairment of erythropoiesis.  
AB  - Aluminum (Al) toxicity has been mainly investigated in uremic patients although healthy subjects and patients without renal insufficiency are not exempt from its potential deleterious effects. This experimental study aims to elucidate the action of different doses of Al citrate on in vivo erythropoiesis and find out whether the metal exerts a local toxic effect upon the bone marrow late erythroid progenitor cells. The groups in the first experimental series were: C1 (n=5) controls and TAl-1 (n=5) rats receiving 1 micromol Al citrate/g body weight/day by gavage. Colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) development was inhibited in the TAl-1 group, but the median osmotic fragility (MOF) and hematocrit (Ht) values were similar to those of the C1 group. The groups in the second series were C2 (n=5) controls and TAl-2 (n=5) rats receiving Al citrate in drinking water (100 mmol/l). The TAl-2 group showed decreased Ht, hemoglobin concentration, MOF and red blood-cell life-span values (P<0.05), and a marked inhibition of the CFU-E development (P<0.01). Serum and bone Al concentrations were increased in both Al-treated groups (P < 0.01). There was a dose-dependent increase in bone Al levels (P < 0.01) and a dose-dependent decrease of CFU-E development (P<0.05). The CFU-E development was inversely correlated with the bone Al content (r=-0.79; P<0.05). The results demonstrate that even very low doses of Al citrate impair erythropoiesis in vivo and higher doses exert a deleterious action on both CFU-E and mature erythrocytes. This might show a local effect of Al on CFU-E caused by the bone sensitivity to the metal accumulation.

TI  - Effect of KATP channel blocker U37883A on renal function in experimental diabetes mellitus in rats.  
AB  - An increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in early diabetes mellitus is considered a risk factor for the development of diabetic nephropathy. Insulin deficiency may increase the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), which could promote afferent arteriolar vasodilation und thus contribute to glomerular hyperfiltration in early diabetes mellitus. To further elucidate this hypothesis we performed renal clearance experiments in anesthetized rats at 2 and 6 weeks after onset of streptozotocin-induced insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and studied the acute effect of the putative KATP channel blocker 4-morpholinecarboximidine-N-1-adamantyl-N'-cyclohexylhydr ochloride (U37883A) on renal function. In control rats, application of U37883A (1.5 mg/kg i.v. bolus plus 1.5 mg/kg/hr) induced a significant reduction in heart rate, but did not affect or even slightly increased mean arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, U37883A did not significantly affect renal vascular resistance, renal blood flow or GFR, but caused an eukaliuretic diuresis and natriuresis and lowered plasma renin activity. Diabetic rats at both 2 or 6 weeks after streptozotocin exhibited essentially an identical response to U37883A; in particular, RVR and glomerular hyperfiltration remained unchanged. These results show that in both control and diabetic rats, the renal excretory function, renin secretion and pace setting in the heart were sensitiv to U37883A, implying a functional contribution of KATP channel activity. However, in both control and diabetic rats, renal vascular resistance, renal blood flow, or GFR were not altered by U37883A. These results argue against a substantial role for KATP channels in the basal control of renal hemodynamics in both nondiabetic and diabetic rats.

TI  - The pressure hold/drop integrity test; its correlation to diffusive flow.  
AB  - The pressure-drop/hold procedure enables the diffusive flow integrity testing of filters to be performed without breaching the system downstream of the filter. It is not necessary to measure volumetrically the diffused gas on the downstream side of the filter. By means of pressure transducers the pressure loss is determined upstream; thus eliminating the threat of sepsis due to down-stream invasions. The pressure decay exercise can be used to characterize the various filter types. A constancy of filter manufacture is required for a given filter type. Unless the pressure drop exceeds the value established as the maximum allowable decay, the filter is judged to be integral. It qualifies as a sterilizing grade filter. Excessive pressure decays will also eventuate from leaks, as from improperly sealed housings. Performed prior to the filtration, the procedure serves to eliminate the wasteful use of an imperfect system, whether caused by faulty sealing, incorrect filter type or flawed filters. Where leaks are detected, the filter can be reexamined for its integrity. To enable the pressure-drop procedure to serve as an integrity test, the measured pressure decays require being correlated with organism retention data. This is made possible by the arithmetic conversion of the pressure decay curve into the conventional diffusive airflow curve established to have such a correlation. The transformation of the pressure-drop curve into the differential airflow plot is automatically performed by certain of the automated integrity test machines. These devices, utilizing pressure transducers, are capable of measuring small pressure drops with requisite sensitivity; gauges commonly are not. Moreover, as previously stated, the measurements are advantageously made on the upside of the filter. The use of automated test machines is, therefore, recommended for the performance of the pressure hold/drop integrity test in furtherance of the practice of filter integrity testing.

TI  -  Mitochondrial sensitivity to AZT.  
AB  - The possibility of tissue-specific effects regarding mitochondrial sensitivity to AZT was evaluated in this study. When mitochondria isolated from liver, kidney, skeletal and cardiac muscle were oxidizing glutamate, a dose-dependent inhibition by AZT of state 3 respiration was observed; using succinate as substrate the inhibition occurred only in skeletal and cardiac muscle mitochondria. The same results were obtained with FCCP-uncoupled mitochondria. NADH oxidase of intact and disrupted mitochondria, isolated from all four tissues was strongly inhibited. Succinate oxidase activity was inhibited by AZT only in intact mitochondria from skeletal and cardiac muscles, suggesting the involvement of succinate transport systems. Similarly, inhibition by the drug of the hydrolytic activity of H(+)-ATPase was observed only in mitochondria of these tissues. These effects taken together, indicate a tissue/carrier-specific inhibition in vitro, although its precise mechanism requires further research.

TI  - The prognostic significance of increasing marker levels in metastatic breast cancer patients with clinically complete remission, partial remission or stable disease.  
AB  - TPS, CA 15-3 and CEA were determined in metastatic breast cancer patients during treatment. After six months of follow-up the patients were divided into four groups according to the UICC criteria for treatment response. Forty-six patients with a more favorable prognosis (complete remission, partial remission or stable disease) were followed for an extended period. In 30 of the 46 patients at least one marker had increased at the end of the six-month period by at least 25% (TPS in 54%, CA 15-3 in 20%, CEA in 20%). All these 30 patients subsequently developed progression. The prognostic sensitivity was 83%, 30% and 30%, respectively, for TPS, CA 15-3 and CEA. The combination of TPS and CA 15-3 showed a sensitivity of 96%. The median lead time was about 8 months for TPS and CA 15-3, but less than 50% of the patients showed a lead time for CA 15-3 as compared to TPS. We conclude that TPS and CA 15-3 determinations are helpful for the prediction of progression during the follow-up of breast cancer patients.

TI  - A practical approach to adjusting for attrition bias in HIV clinical trials with serial marker responses.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To illustrate a simple approach to adjusting for bias due to drop-outs (i.e., attrition bias) when evaluating the effect of a certain therapy in HIV clinical trials using the mean change in plasma viral load. To evaluate its validity and to compare its performance with that of another simple method for handling drop-outs: the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. DESIGN: Data from a notional treated group of 100 patients followed up to 52 weeks were generated. Attrition bias was introduced by mimicking selective patient drop-out (i.e., more likely in patients doing badly). METHODS: The difference between the true mean change in HIV RNA levels at 52 weeks and the observed mean change because of drop-outs was calculated (attrition bias). The reduction in bias obtained by using the proposed approach was then calculated and compared with that obtained by using the LOCF method. To assess the performance of the methods over the entire follow-up, the mean areas under the curves were considered. RESULTS: Our method reduced the bias by a clinically relevant amount in a variety of different settings. In most of our simulations, bias was reduced by a larger amount than that obtainable from using the LOCF method. CONCLUSIONS: The current situation is that results from trials in HIV infection are invariably presented with no associated attempt to quantify the attrition bias present. Attrition-adjusted plots of mean change in HIV RNA should, we believe, be presented alongside usual plots as a form of sensitivity analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR) and virus cultures with HIV-RNA assays (viral load) in the early diagnosis of vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and six infants born to HIV-1 seropositive mothers were divided into three groups: A) Nineteen newborns (24-26 hours of age): B) Twenty-three infants between 1 and 2 months of age; and C) Sixty-four infants older than 2 months. HIV-1 RNA was measured in plasma and HIV proviral DNA was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by DNA-PCR. The HIV was isolated by a microculture technique. RESULTS: In the samples obtained during the neonatal period (less than 96 hours of age), 75% of the infants were positive by viral load analysis, 50% by proviral DNA-PCR and only 25% by culture assay. In group B, 100% of the infants were positive by viral load analysis and 85.7% by proviral DNA-PCR and culture assays. Viral load, proviral DNA-PCR and cultures were positive in all infants older than 2 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the 3 techniques, viral load, DNA-PCR and culture, have 100% sensitivity after 2 months of age. However, the viral load technique, which is not routinely used, was found to have a higher sensitivity than proviral DNA-PCR and viral culture in infants younger than 2 months. We conclude that viral load is a useful technique to diagnose HIV infection in newborns.

TI  - Transposon-derived Brucella abortus rough mutants are attenuated and exhibit reduced intracellular survival.  
AB  - The O antigen of Brucella abortus has been described as a major virulence determinant based on the attenuated survival of fortuitously isolated rough variants. However, the lack of genetic definition of these mutants and the virulence of naturally occurring rough species, Brucella ovis and Brucella canis, has confused interpretation. To better characterize the role of O antigen in virulence and survival, transposon mutagenesis was used to generate B. abortus rough mutants defective in O-antigen presentation. Sequence analysis of DNA flanking the site of Tn5 insertion was used to verify insertion in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic functions. Not surprisingly, each of the rough mutants was attenuated for survival in mice, but unexpected differences among the mutants were observed. In an effort to define the basis for the observed differences, the structure of the rough LPS and the sensitivity of these mutants to individual killing mechanisms were examined in vitro. All of the B. abortus rough mutants exhibited a 4- to 5-log-unit increase, compared to the smooth parental strain, in sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis. Little change was evident in the sensitivity of these organisms to hydrogen peroxide, consistent with an inability of O antigen to exclude relatively small molecules.  Sensitivity to polymyxin B, which was employed as a model cationic, amphipathic peptide similar to defensins found in phagocytic cells, revealed survival differences among the rough mutants similar to those observed in the mouse. One mutant in particular exhibited hypersensitivity to polymyxin B and reduced survival in mice. This mutant was characterized by a truncated rough LPS. DNA sequence analysis of this mutant revealed a transposon interruption in the gene encoding phosphomannomutase (pmm), suggesting that this activity may be required for the synthesis of a full-length core polysaccharide in addition to O antigen. B. abortus O antigen appears to be essential for extra- and intracellular survival in mice.

The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even citrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium-specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive.  The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species-specific probes.

TI  - Evidence for the role of follicle stimulating hormone in maintaining the oocyte meiotic arrest in pre-antral follicles.  
AB  - The study was designed to clarify the physiological role of FSH in maintaining the meiotic arrest in vitro of oocytes derived from intact and from hypophysectomized hamsters.  The sensitivity to FSH in maintaining the meiotic arrest of oocytes during incubation of pre-antral follicles of adult golden hamsters was estimated: log dose-response curves were characterized by an ED50 of about 0.2 pg FSH/ml (= 1 microU). After hypophysectomy oocytes of the pre-antral follicles were screened for the presence of a germinal vesicle (GV). The breakdown of the GV (GVBD) rose from 0 on day 0 to 48.8 +/- 13.8% on day 1, to 55.9 +/- 6.8% on day 2 and to 64.3 +/- 7.4 on day 6 (p < 0.001 vs day 0). Incubation without FSH of the pre-antral follicles obtained from the same hypophysectomized animals showed an almost complete disappearance of the GV at the same time intervals. Incubation with 2 pg FSH/ml (= 10 microU) still demonstrated the inhibiting effect of FSH on the meiotic resumption: 13.4 +/- 4.3% (day 0), 36.9 +/- 16.3% (day 1), 38.7 +/- 21.0% (day 2) and of 38.1 +/- 12.6% (p > 0.1) on day 6. These results demonstrate that very low doses of FSH are able to maintain the meiotic arrest in oocytes of pre-antral follicles of the golden hamster and that deprivation of FSH by hypophysectomy involves a disappearance of GV oocytes to a certain extent.

TI  - Effects of G6PD overexpression in NIH3T3 cells treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide or paraquat.  
AB  - The major physiological role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is to provide NADPH, which is required for reductive biosynthesis and for detoxification of free radicals and peroxides in mature red blood cells. To study the function of G6PD in non-erythroid cells, we examined the sensitivity of NIH3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid containing human G6PD cDNA to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) and paraquat. Two transfected clones which had a sixteen-fold (H7 clone) and six-fold (H6 clone) increase in their intracellular G6PD activity were compared with control cells transfected with a vector alone. Cells with high-level expression of human G6PD were 2.3 (H6) to 3.7 (H7) times more resistant to TBH than control cells. The antioxidant (anti-TBH) abilities in H6 and H7 cells were revealed by (1) a significant increase in the intracellular level of NADPH and glutathione, (2) a reduction of fluorescent intensity of the oxidant-sensitive dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, and (3) a significant reduction in the production of oxidized adducts generated by lipid peroxidation. In contrast, cells overexpressing G6PD were very sensitive to paraquat, a superoxide-producing herbicide. The concentrations of paraquat required to produce a 50% decrease in cell viability of H7, H6 and control cells were 0.80 mM, 1.14 mM, and 2.19 mM, respectively. The cytotoxicity of paraquat correlated with the expression level of NADPH in the cells. In this study, overexpression of human G6PD in NIH3T3 cells had different effects on the toxicity of TBH vs. paraquat. Reduction of NADP+ to NADPH by G6PD protects cells from oxidative damage by TBH, but appears to enhance the toxicity of paraquat.

TI  - Evaluation of MUG-supplemented media for the detection of E. coli in recreational water surveillance.  
AB  - Four media containing 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide were evaluated as a non-confirmatory procedure for E. coli detection in recreational water surveillance. The media included ECD-Agar for membrane filtration and laurylsulphate-tryptose, brilliant-green-bile and lactose as broth media in a three tube most probable number procedure. From six representative water sites, samples were collected weekly over a typical summer season (17.05-27.09.1994) and processed as parallels, using each media at two different incubation temperatures (36 degrees/44 degrees C). Results showed that incubation temperature had no impact on E. coli counts. Each media at a given temperature could be regarded as individual enrichment procedure. None of these enrichment procedures showed a constant and predictable higher sensitivity during the sampling period at all sites compared to the others tested. For parallel results, the rate of agreement, based upon EC-guideline (76/160/EWG) staging of recreational water quality, was 85% for membrane filtration and 75% for the MPN-procedure results. Marked differences could be observed in false-positive specificity showing correlation to the selective characteristics of the media. Subsequently lactose-broth at 44 degrees C performed worst with 30% non verifiable results, while ECD-agar and laurysulphate-tryptose-broth, both at 44 degrees C, had a nearly 100% confirmation rate. Thus, combining high specificity with no lack in sensitivity these two MUG-supplemented media seem to be best suited for E. coli detection in routine recreational water surveillance.
