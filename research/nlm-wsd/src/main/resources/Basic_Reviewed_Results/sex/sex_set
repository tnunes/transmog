TI  - Evaluating an AIDS sexual risk reduction program for young adults in public night schools in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe sexual risk for HIV infection among adult night school students in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to evaluate the effect of an HIV/AIDS prevention workshop to reduce sexual risk. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted among four demographically similar public night schools in the inner city of Sao Paulo. Schools were randomized into intervention and control conditions. Of 394 young adults who took part in the baseline survey, 304 (77%) completed a postintervention questionnaire. INTERVENTIONS: In a workshop consisting of four sessions of 3 h each, the students discussed AIDS symbolism, the impact of AIDS on their lives, risk perception, the way in which sexual norms shape knowledge and attitudes, AIDS-related knowledge, reproduction and sexual pleasure, and condom use negotiation. We fostered community-building through AIDS training courses for teachers in the schools, peer support programs and public events. RESULTS: At baseline, 87% had been sexually active at some time and 76% had had sex in the past 6 months. Among those who reported vaginal intercourse and/or anal intercourse, condom use was low. The workshops were positively process-evaluated and supported by the community, the students, their teachers and their parents. We obtained statistically significant effects from the workshops for females only, who reported improved communication with partners about sex and AIDS and less unprotected sex with non-monogamous partners after the intervention. CONCLUSION: These data show that the sexual risk of HIV infection can be lowered when Brazilian disenfranchized communities support AIDS prevention workshops. Even more impressive results may be achieved if the need to address socioeconomic obstacles and gendered sexual roles is emphasized through further long-term community development programs.

TI  - Duration of colorectal cancer symptoms and survival: the effect of confounding clinical and pathological variables.  
AB  - The relationship between symptom duration and long-term survival following colorectal cancer is complex, and a number of factors may influence the length of time from onset of symptoms of cancer diagnosis. We prospectively studied 777 consecutive colorectal cancer patients to determine the association between symptom duration and survival independent of other clinical and pathological features. We used survival curves, the logrank test and Cox's proportional hazards model to assess possible changes in relative risk of death with increasing symptom duration, without making any a priori assumptions. We found that symptom duration shortened with advanced tumour stage (P < 0.0006) and was also shorter for patients presenting with bowel obstruction (P < 0.0001). Univariate survival analysis showed that long-term survival increased consistently with symptom duration (P < 0.001). However, when the effect of tumour stage and bowel obstruction were accounted for in a multivariate analysis, no decrease in the relative risk of death was seen as symptom duration increased. The addition of other variables to the proportional hazards model such as age, sex or tumour site did not further influence the risk function form of symptom duration. Our results suggest that early diagnosis of colorectal cancer should remain our goal when assessing patients with suggestive gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - The role of enophthalmos in involutional entropion.  
AB  - Relative enophthalmos is often cited as a causative factor in the development of involutional entropion. However, the association between enophthalmos and involutional entropion is largely anecdotal; no patient population study has been performed to determine if a causal relationship exists. This prospective clinical study compares exophthalmometric values in a population of patients with involutional entropion to an age- and sex-matched control group. Hertel exophthalmometric measurements were obtained on 56 patients with involutional entropion presenting over a 2-year period. Exophthalmometric measurements were also obtained in a group of 53 age- and sex-matched control patients presenting for evaluation and management of unrelated periocular disorders. Fifty-three patients presented with unilateral entropion and three patients presented with bilateral lower lid entropion. The mean of exophthalmometric measurements was within 16.0 mm in the entropion group and 16.15 mm in the control group. Eyes with involutional entropion are no more likely to have enophthalmos than is the uninvolved contralateral eye or normal eyes of an age- and sex-matched control population. Enophthalmos does not appear to play a role in the development of involutional entropion.

TI  - Hemispatial neglect on visual search tasks in Alzheimer's disease.  
AB  - Abnormal visual attention may underlie certain visuospatial difficulties in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These patients have hypometabolism and neuropathology in parietal cortex. Given the role of parietal function for visuospatial attention, patients with AD may have relative hemispatial neglect masked by other cognitive disturbances. Fifteen patients with-to-moderate AD and 15 healthy elderly controls matched for age, sex, and education were compared on four measures of neglect the visual search of a complex picture, a letter cancellation task, the Schenkenberg line bisection test, and a computerized line bisection task. Compared with controls, the group with AD was significantly impaired overall in attending to left hemispace on both picture search (F[1,56] = 11.27, p < 0.05) and cancellation tasks (F[1,112] = 12.68, p < 0.01); however, a subgroup of patients with AD had disproportionate difficulty in attending to right hemispace. The performance of the groups did not differ on either of the line bisection tasks regardless of the hand used. In AD, hemispatial neglect on visual search tasks may relate to difficulty in disengaging attention or in visual exploration, as well as to the severity of the disease. Future investigations may implicate neglect in visually related deficits in AD, for example, the prominent difficulty with left turns on driving a car.

TI  - An assessment of peripheral immunity in patients with sarcoidosis using measurements of serum vitamin D3, cytokines and soluble CD23 [see comments]  
AB  - The aetiology of the peripheral anergy in sarcoidosis is unclear. To investigate this further we measured the serum levels of several factors important in different aspects of immune regulation to obtain a profile of those factors which promote and inhibit immune activation in sarcoidosis. Thirty-seven patients with sarcoidosis and 20 healthy controls of similar sex and age comprised the study group. Serum IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), soluble CD23 (sCD23), IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured using in-house ELISAs. Vitamin D3 was measured using a radioreceptor assay. Serum levels of sCD23 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients with sarcoidosis relative to controls (median 13.9 versus 9.5 arbitrary units/ml, P<0.01 for sCD23, and 9.6 versus 5.0 pg/ml, P<0.04 for IL-10). Regardless of steroid therapy or disease activity, serum levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, GM-CSF and IL-8 were no different in patients with sarcoidosis and controls. Vitamin D3 levels were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis versus normal controls (medians 78.0 versus 56.0, P<0.001), active sarcoidosis (n = 20) versus inactive disease (n = 17) (medians 81.5 versus 66.0, P<0.03) and active sarcoidosis versus controls (medians 81.5 versus 56.0, P<0.0002). The levels were no different between patients with inactive sarcoidosis and controls. We suggest that IL-10 and vitamin D3 may contribute to the peripheral anergy in sarcoidosis. The elevated serum sCD23 suggests an increase in peripheral humoral immunity. Consistent with a quiescent peripheral immune system, factors capable of monocyte/macrophage activation (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF and IL-8) were not elevated in the peripheral circulation.

TI  - Aerobic exercise capacity remains normal despite impaired endothelial function in the micro- and macrocirculation of physically active IDDM patients.  
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine if diabetes in the absence of neuropathy affects the exercising capacity of IDDM patients, and whether regular, intense training has a beneficial effect on endothelial function. Five groups of subjects were studied: 23 healthy control subjects who exercised regularly (age 33 +/- 6 years), 23 nonneuropathic type 1 diabetic patients who exercised regularly (age 33 +/- 6 years, IDDM duration 11 +/- 8 years), 7 neuropathic type 1 diabetic patients who exercised regularly (age 36 +/- 7 years, IDDM duration 22 +/- 8 years), 18 healthy subjects who did not exercise regularly (age 34 +/- 7 years), and 5 nonneuropathic type 1 diabetic patients who did not exercise regularly (age 31 +/- 4 years, IDDM duration 20 +/- 3 years). All groups were matched for age, sex, and body weight. No differences existed in the energy expenditure per week in physical activity among the three exercising groups or between the two nonexercising groups. The maximal oxygen uptake was similar between control and diabetic nonneuropathic exercisers, and among diabetic neuropathic exercisers, control nonexercisers, and diabetic nonexercisers; however, a significant difference existed between the first two and the last three groups (P < 0.0001). A stepwise increase was found in the resting heart rate among the groups, ranging from the lowest in control exercisers to the highest in diabetic nonexercisers, but the maximal heart rate was lower only in diabetic neuropathic exercisers compared with all other groups (P < 0.05). Assessments of endothelial function in both macro- and microcirculation were performed in 12 control exercisers, 10 diabetic nonneuropathic exercisers, 5 diabetic neuropathic exercisers, 17 control nonexercisers, and 4 diabetic nonexercisers. When all diabetic patients were considered as one group and all control subjects as another, the microcirculation endothelial function in the diabetic group was reduced compared with the control subjects (91 +/- 49 vs. 122 +/- 41% flux increase over baseline; P < 0.05). In contrast, no differences existed among the three diabetic groups or between the two control groups. Similarly, in macrocirculation, a reduced response during reactive hyperemia was observed in the diabetic patients compared with control subjects (7.0 +/- 4.5 vs. 11.2 +/- 6.6% diameter increase; P < 0.05), whereas again no difference existed among the three diabetic groups or between the two control groups. These data suggest that diabetes per se does not affect aerobic exercise capacity (VO2max) in physically active individuals, but is reduced in the presence of neuropathy. In addition, regular exercise training involving the lower extremities does not improve the endothelial function in the micro- and macrocirculation of the nonexercised upper extremity in type 1 diabetic patients.

TI  - Ventilatory lung function tests in school children of 6-13 years.  
AB  - Spirometry was performed in 186 healthy school children, 6-13 years of age, selected from urban population of Rohtak city (India), to derive the regression equation for prediction of normal value of ventilatory lung function in this age group. Values of lung functions in the present study are well comparable to other North Indian studies and Western reports, but higher than the South Indian children. Lung functions have shown better linear correlation with age and height as compared to weight. Comparison of ventilatory function tests in boys and girls showed statistically higher FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEF25% and MVV in boys, while FEF50% FEF75% and FEF75-85% were statistically higher in girls in different age groups. No specific pattern of variation in lung function tests was observed with sex. Regression equations for different ventilatory functions have been derived for either sex with the best possible combination of physical parameters.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation in older stroke patients: association with recurrence and mortality after first ischemic stroke [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with stroke recurrence and mortality and with the causes of death in ischemic stroke patients aged 75 years and older. DESIGN: A population-based study. SETTING: The cities of Turku and Kuopio in Finland. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort consisted of 2635 consecutive patients aged 75 years and older, with a first ischemic stroke, registered in the FINMONICA Stroke Register. MEASUREMENTS: 28-day and 1-year stroke mortality, causes of death, and recurrence of stroke. RESULTS: There were 767 stroke patients with AF (mean age 82.2) and 1868 patients without AF (mean age 81.4). Mortality was higher in the AF group both 28 days (33.9% vs 28.1%, P = .003) and 1 year after the attack (52.7% vs 43.0%, P < .001). The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of death at 28 days was 1.25 in the AF group (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.50, P = .018), and at 1 year it was 1.41 (95% CI 1.18-1.67, P < .001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, 1-year mortality risk comparing the AF-group with non-AF group was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.39, P < .001). The strongest risk factor predicting 1-year mortality was recent myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.49-2.42). Myocardial infarction was more often the underlying cause of death in the AF group during the period of 28 days, but not from 28 days up to 1 year. The 1-year recurrence rate among those alive at day 28 was 11.5% in the AF group and 9.4% in the non-AF group (P = .240). CONCLUSION: Recent MI and AF are independent negative prognostic factors in older patients with stroke. Although the relative risk estimates attributable to AF are of the same magnitude in older as in middle-aged stroke patients, the much higher prevalence of AF in the older patients emphasizes its absolute impact on the mortality and recurrence after the first ischemic stroke in the age group 75 years and older. The treatment of coexisting cardiac disease also has the potential to prevent deaths and recurrent stroke events in older persons.

TI  - Cytogenetic effect of chronic low-dose, low-dose-rate gamma-radiation in residents of irradiated buildings.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people in Taiwan have been living in buildings constructed with cobalt-60-contaminated steel rods. To study the biological effects of chronic low-dose ionising radiation on the residents of one such building, micronucleus formation in these individuals was compared with that in controls. METHODS: The 73 residents had 77 age-and-sex-matched controls: 31 had 31 close relatives as controls (group A controls); eight of the 31 had a second set of close relatives; and the other controls were 38 residents in neighbouring buildings. Two micronucleus assays were used-a cytochalasin B (CBMN) assay and another involving incubation with cytarabine (CBMNA). Assay results are given as "frequency", or the number of binucleate cells containing one micronucleus per 1000 randomly examined binucleate cells. FINDINGS: The CBMN and CBMNA mean (SD) frequencies for 31 exposed individuals (0.016 [0.009] and 0.025 [0.013] respectively) were greater than those for their group A controls (0.009 [0.004] and 0.016 [0.009], respectively) (p = 0.0006 and 0.0002, respectively). The mean CBMN and CBMNA frequencies for all the exposed individuals (0.017 [0.011] and 0.030 [0.014], respectively) were significantly greater than those for all controls (0.011 [0.008] and 0.019 [0.01]; p = 0.0001 for both comparisons). The ranges of the differences in CBMN or CBMNA frequencies between 31 exposed individuals and their group A controls were 0.003 to 0.020 and 0.001 to 0.032, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and cigarette smoking, the adjusted relative risks of micronucleus formation from radiation exposure in all 73 residents was 1.58 (95% CI 1.42-1.71; p = 0.0001) by the CBMN assay and 1.64 (1.53-1.77; p = 0.0001) by the CBMNA assay. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that chronic low-dose and low-dose-rate gamma-ray environmental exposure may induce cytogenetic damage in human beings.

TI  - Behavioral effects of low-dose gestational day 11-13 retinoic acid exposure.  
AB  - In a comparison article we report that maternal PO exposure to 2.5 mg/kg all-trans retinoic acid (RA) daily for 3 consecutive days over gestational days (GD) 11-13 produces a 10% reduction in weight of cerebellum at 4 weeks of age, not accompanied by other malformations. Here we report the results of a preliminary behavioral analysis of offspring exposed gestationally to RA as above. Exposed dams were allowed to deliver normally, and litters were culled to eight pups (4 +/- 1 of each sex) at birth. Both male and female offspring were tested prior to weaning on GD 21. Thereafter females were killed on postnatal day (PND) 28 for verification of RA effects on regional brain weight, and all subsequent behavioral testing was conducted on males. Preweaning tests were restricted to negative geotaxis (PND 8-9) and open field activity (PND 22). Postweaning tests included open field activity (PND 43), auditory startle response (three times, on PNDs 22, 43, and 84), 2-week activity in residential running wheels (PNDs 62-76), complex maze performance for 5 consecutive days (PND 83-87), emergence latency (PND 106), and assessment of the behavioral response to an amphetamine challenge (PND 107). Males were then killed on PND 108 for verification of RA effects on regional brain weights. In this study, RA reduced weight of cerebellum but not striatum. Cerebellar weight was 92% of control values in PND 28 females, and this weight difference had diminished to 95% of control weight by PND 108 in males. There were no treatment effects on negative geotaxis, activity in a small open field, auditory startle amplitude, or latency to enter an illuminated alley from a dark chamber. Maze learning occurred at levels equal to or slightly better than controls. Running wheel activity was enhanced by RA exposure, whereas activity in response to an amphetamine challenge was reduced by such exposure. We conclude that RA doses low enough to produce mild weight reductions in cerebellum, without attendant malformations, can alter behavior. The precise nature of these alterations remains to be elucidated, but the findings reported here suggest that effects may be more pronounced on activity than on learning.

TI  - Basal metabolism of weight-stable chronically undernourished men and women: lack of metabolic adaptation and ethnic differences.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether weight-stable chronically energy-deficient subjects exhibit evidence of metabolic adaptation and to establish whether international predictive equations overestimate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of tropical populations. BMR, body weight, height, and fat-free mass (FFM) by underwater weighing were measured in healthy, physically active urban dwellers of low socioeconomic status (178 men and women aged 22-38 y) in Bangalore, Southern India. Subjects were selected on the basis of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) and classified in three groups: severely undernourished (BMI < 17.0; n = 30 men, n = 25 women), marginally undernourished (BMI = 17.0-18.5; n = 31 men, n = 30 women), and well nourished (BMI > 18.5; n = 27 men, n = 35 women). The BMR of the well-nourished group, expressed in absolute terms (6.20 and 5.18 MJ/d for men and women, respectively), was significantly higher (P < 0.000) than that of the severely undernourished group (5.72 and 4.64 MJ/d for men and women, respectively). Normalizing BMR for either body weight or FFM by analysis of covariance abolished all differences. The mean BMR of the low-BMI study group was substantially higher (11-14%) than reported previously for undernourished Indian adults. The BMR of both men and women, regardless of their nutritional status, was accurately estimated by age- and sex-specific FAO/WHO/UNU equations. These findings suggest the absence of an enhanced metabolic response in weight-stable chronically undernourished adults. This is in contrast with earlier reports, and supports more recent views. The study also provides evidence of the absence of ethnic-specific energy turnover in Indians.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and outcome in 223 diabetic patients with deep foot infections.  
AB  - Clinical characteristics and outcome in 223 consecutive diabetic patients with deep foot infections are reported. Patients were treated by a multidisciplinary diabetic foot-care team at the University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, and were prospectively followed until healing or death. About 50% of patients lacked clinical signs of infection, such as a body temperature > 37.8 degrees C, a sedimentation rate > 70 mm/hour, and white blood cell count (WBC) > 10 x 10(9)/liter. Eighty-six percent had surgery before healing or death. Thirty-nine percent healed without amputation; 34% healed after a minor and 8% after a major amputation. Sixteen percent were unhealed at death, and 3% were unhealed at the end of the observation period. Of those unhealed at death or follow-up, 4 patients had had a major and 11 a minor amputation. After correction for age and sex, duration of diabetes < 14 years, palpable popliteal pulse, a toe pressure > 45 mmHg, and an ankle pressure > 80 mm Hg, absence of exposed bone and a white blood cell count < 12 x 10(9)/liter were all related to healing without amputation in a logistic regression analysis. We conclude that although only 1 in 10 had a major amputation, nearly all diabetic patients with a deep foot infection needed surgery and more than one third had a minor amputation before healing or death in spite of a well-functioning diabetic foot-care team responsible for all included patients.

TI  - Fasting triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and risk of myocardial infarction.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may play a role in atherogenesis. However, whether triglycerides, as a marker for these lipoproteins, represent an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease remains unclear, despite extensive research. Several methodological issues have limited the interpretability of the existing data. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the interrelationships of fasting triglycerides, other lipid parameters, and nonlipid risk factors with risk of myocardial infarction among 340 cases and an equal number of age-, sex-, and community-matched control subjects. Cases were men or women of <76 years of age with no prior history of coronary disease who were discharged from one of six Boston area hospitals with the diagnosis of a confirmed myocardial infarction. In crude analyses, we observed a significant association of elevated fasting triglycerides with risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk [RR] in the highest compared with the lowest quartile=6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.8 to 12.1; P for trend <.001). Results were not materially altered after control for nonlipid coronary risk factors. As expected, the relationship was attenuated after adjustment for HDL but remained statistically significant (RR in the highest quartile=2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.4 to 5.5; P for trend=.016). Furthermore, the ratio of triglycerides to HDL was a strong predictor of myocardial infarction (RR in the highest compared with the lowest quartile=16.0; 95% CI=7.7 to 33.1; P for trend <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that fasting triglycerides, as a marker for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, may provide valuable information about the atherogenic potential of the lipoprotein profile, particularly when considered in context of HDL levels.

TI  - Glycosylated hemoglobin level and carotid intimal-medial thickening in nondiabetic individuals. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular events. However, questions remain about what role, if any, homeostatic glucose control plays in the development of cardiovascular disease among nondiabetic individuals. We investigated the relationship between HbA1c level and carotid intimal-medial thickening in normoglycemic individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among 208 normoglycemic individuals (fasting glucose < or = 6.4 mmol/l and no history of diabetes) who had carotid initial-medial thickening (case subjects) and 208 normoglycemic control subjects individually matched for age, sex, race, field center, and date of exam. Subjects were free-living men and women, aged 45-64 years at baseline, who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. RESULTS: HbA1c levels, expressed as percent of total hemoglobin, ranged from 4 to 7% and correlated only modestly with single measurements of fasting glucose (r = 0.16) and fasting insulin (r = 0.14). The mean level of HbA1c was 5.18% among case subjects and 5.07% among control subjects (P = 0.004, paired t test). As compared with the first quartile of HbA1c the matched relative odds of being a case were 1.15, 1.33, and 2.30 for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively (P = 0.005 for linear trend). After multivariate adjustment for age, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, BMI, smoking status, hypertension, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and education level, the respective relative odds estimates were 0.98, 1.07, and 1.88 (P = 0.16 for linear trend). When modeled linearly as a continuous variable and after adjustment for the above-mentioned covariates, a 1% point increment in HbA1c level was associated with 1.77 greater odds of being a case (95% CI, 0.9-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide some support to the hypothesis that in the absence of diabetes, homeostatic glycemic control is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

TI  - Development of guidelines to designate alleles using an STR multiplex system.  
AB  - We have carried out extensive validation of a multiplex system of 6 STR loci and the Amelogenin sex test to investigate the following characteristics: relative peak areas of heterozygote peaks; non-specific artefacts; stutters caused by slippage of the Taq enzyme; pull-up (an electronic artefact often associated with software). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how interpretation guidelines can be formulated by experimentation and analysis using casework samples. Automation allows data relating to band position (in base pairs), peak area and peak height to be easily collected and manipulated in spreadsheets or computer programs. This paves the way to designing expert systems to carry out the interpretative process.

TI  - [Skin disease and sexuality. An empirical study of sex behavior or patients with psoriasis vulgaris and neurodermatitis in comparison with skin-healthy probands]  
AB  - Fifty-three patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic eczema and 52 controls with healthy skin were compared with regard to their sexual behavior. For the test, questionnaires developed by Arentewicz as well as our own questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used. Patients with skin diseases had a significantly impaired sex life, compared to those with healthy skin. There was a highly significant reduction in the exchange of tenderness in patients of both sexes, and in the capacity for orgasm in female patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was found concerning the frequency of intercourse. Patients with psoriasis felt more impaired than those with atopic eczema. Ninety-three percent of psoriatics and 96% of patients with atopic eczema had not been asked about their sexual life by their attending doctor. We discuss to what extent skin diseases are possibly involved in the regulation of nearness and distance among partners. The dermatologist should a be knowledgeable and understanding source for patients which skin diseases who have questions about their disease and its effect on their sex life.

TI  - Signal-averaged electrocardiography in healthy children: relationship with age, sex, and anthropometry.  
AB  - Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (SAECGs) have been found to be influenced by sex and anthropometry in adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this relationship in children. Total filtered QRS duration (TQRS), duration of high-frequency, low-amplitude signals in the terminal portion of the QRS complex that were less than 40 microV (HFLA) root-mean-square voltage in the last 40 ms of the filtered QRS (RMS40) were determined by high-resolution electrocardiographic (ECG) recording (MAC 15 ECG System, Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI). These parameters were correlated with age, sex, body weight, height, relative weight, body mass index, and body surface area. As HFLA and RMS40 were not normally distributed, they were logarithmically transformed for regression analysis. The best subset multiple regression procedure was used to evaluate the variables that would optimally influence SAECG measurements and to obtain regression equations for the prediction of each SAECG parameter. Although univariate analysis shows that almost all the body characteristics and age are significantly correlated with SAECGs, multiple regression analysis reveals that TQRS is significantly influenced by height (P < .0001), relative weight (P = .012), and body mass index (P = .041); HFLA is influenced by weight (P = .001), height (P = .004), and body mass index (P = .001); and RMS40 is influenced by height (P < .0001) and relative weight (P = .001). Sex is noted to significantly influence both TQRS and RMS40 (P < .0001, P = .002, respectively), while HFLA is found to be significantly related to age (P = .001). In summary, SAECGs in Chinese children are shown to be influenced by height, weight, and relative weight or body mass index, but not body surface area, while age and sex also significantly contribute to the variation of some SAECG parameters.

TI  - Sex chromosomes and sex determining mechanisms in birds.  
AB  - The sex chromosomes in birds are designated Z and W, and the male is the homomorphic sex (ZZ) and the female heteromorphic (ZW). In most avian species the Z chromosome is a large chromosome, usually the fourth or fifth largest, and it contains almost all the known sex-linked genes. The W chromosome is generally a much smaller microchromosome, containing a high proportion of repeat sequence DNA. Recently a gene encoding a protein involved in transcriptional activation of chromatin has been detected on the W chromosome. The weight of evidence suggests that sex determination in birds is by a genic balance mechanism, in which the ratio of autosomes to Z chromosomes is the crucial factor. DNA sequences homologous to the testis determining factor in humans have been detected in both male and female birds, but it is not clear that they have a sex-related function in birds. A number of different practical methods have been developed to distinguish the sex of birds, based on sex-linked genes, the amount of DNA per cell and using DNA probes for sex-linked sequences.

TI  - Screening of sex workers in Turkey for Chlamydia trachomatis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing migration of sex workers across East European borders into Turkey has resulted in increased arrests of unregistered sex workers. There is concern regarding the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) such as C. trachomatis in this unregulated group. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of C. trachomatis infection and selected related demographic and behavioral factors among registered and unregistered sex workers in Istanbul, Turkey. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, the prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was studied by direct fluorescent antibody testing in 248 sex workers: 158 presented for routine medical screening and 90 who were arrested for lack of registration. All subjects were interviewed regarding demographic factors, sexual activity, and antibiotic and drug use. RESULTS: The overall C. trachomatis prevalence was 12.9% (12.0% registered and 14.4% unregistered). There was a strong association between never using condoms and chlamydia positivity (odds ratio 8.9 [95% confidence interval 3.7 to 21.6]). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of C. trachomatis among all tested sex workers and the lack of regular condom use, particularly among unregistered sex workers, indicate that there is an urgent need for safe sex education and continued STD screening of unregistered sex workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study the authors evaluated the relationship between personality traits (according to DSM-III-R) and poor metabolic control in an adult onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus sample (n = 77). METHODS: Personality traits were assessed with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire--Revised. Metabolic control was evaluated through glycosilated hemoglobin (HbA1c): poor metabolic control was defined as HbA1c > or = 9% (normal values < 6.0%). RESULTS: Principal Component Analysis revealed three personality profiles: 'Cluster A/C Mixed', 'Cluster B Dependent' and 'Cluster B Aggressive'. Oneway ANCOVA, using sex as covariate, revealed a significant association (p = 0.01) only between poor metabolic control and Cluster B Dependent profile. No correlation was found between HbA1c and the other profiles. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a specific personality profile is associated with poor metabolic control.

TI  - Regional cerebral blood flow during the Wisconsin Card Sort Test in schizotypal personality disorder.  
AB  - Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by single photon emission computed tomography in 10 patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and nine age- and sex-matched normal volunteers. Subjects performed both the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) and a control task, the Symbol Matching Test (SMT). Four-way analyses of variance were performed to assess relative rCBF of the prefrontal cortex and of the medial temporal region. Normal volunteers showed more marked activation in the precentral gyrus, while SPD patients showed greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus. Relative flow in the left prefrontal cortex was correlated with better WCST performance in normal volunteers. SPD patients, however, showed no such correlations in the left prefrontal cortex, but demonstrated correlations of good and bad performance with CBF in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus, respectively. Thus, at least some SPD patients demonstrate abnormal patterns of prefrontal activation, perhaps as a compensation for dysfunction in other regions.

TI  - Survival analysis and visual outcome in a large series of corneal transplants in India.  
AB  - AIM/BACKGROUND: The public health significance of corneal transplantation in dealing with corneal blindness in the developing world would depend upon the survival rate of transplants. This study was done to analyse the survival rate of corneal transplants in a large series in India, and to evaluate the influence of various risk factors on transplant survival. METHODS: The records of a series of 1725 cases of corneal transplants carried out during 1987-95 at a tertiary eye care institution in India were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine 5 year survival rates of corneal transplants performed for the various categories of preoperative diagnosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess how preoperative diagnosis, socioeconomic status, age, sex, vascularisation of host cornea, quality of donor cornea, and training status of surgeon influenced transplant survival. The effect of these variables on visual outcome was assessed using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years for all corneal transplants performed for the first time in 1389 cases were 79.6% (95% confidence interval = 77.3-81.9%), 68.7% (65.7-71.7%) and 46.5% (41.7-51.3%). The 5 year survival rate was highest if the corneal transplant was done for keratoconus (95.1% (84.8-100%)) and lowest if carried out for previous transplant failure (21.2% (13.8-28.6%)). The relative risk of transplant failure was higher if the preoperative diagnosis was previous transplant failure (2.04 (1.62-2.55)), aphakic bullous keratopathy (1.78 (1.38-2.28)), corneal clouding due to miscellaneous causes including congenital conditions and glaucoma (1.63 (1.21-2.19)), or adherent leucoma (1.11 (0.81-1.51)) than for the other preoperative diagnoses. Patients with lower socioeconomic status had higher relative risk of transplant failure (1.28 (1.16-1.42)), as did patients < 10 years of age (1.42 (1.23-1.64)). Higher relative risk of transplant failure was associated with vascularisation of the host cornea before transplantation (1.15 (1.04-1.27)), and with the use of fair quality donor cornea for transplantation compared with excellent, very good, or good quality donor cornea (1.26 (1.06-1.52)). Before corneal transplant 80.2% of the eyes were blind (visual acuity < 3/60), whereas at last follow up 41.8% eyes were blind. The odds of having visual acuity > 6/18 were higher if the transplant was done for keratoconus (9.99 (6.10-16.36)) or corneal dystrophies (1.77 (1.21-2.58)) than for the other preoperative diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Reasonable success with corneal transplantation is possible in the developing world if data from this part of the world regarding the different survival rates for the various preoperative diagnoses and the influence of risk factors on transplant survival and visual outcome are taken into account while determining priority for transplant cases in the present situation of limited availability of donor corneas.

TI  - Patient satisfaction with emergency house calls.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify determinants of patient satisfaction with emergency house calls and to assess the properties of a satisfaction measurement questionnaire. DESIGN: Patient survey, combined with routinely collected information on the circumstances of the house call. SETTING: Emergency house calls provided by an independent emergency care organization (ECO) in Geneva, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 389 patients (67% response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient satisfaction. Predictor variables: patient age and sex, type of medical problem, time of visit, waiting time, duration of visit, perceived effectiveness of treatment. RESULTS: The satisfaction questionnaire was easy to administer. Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the ECO. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the ECO. CONCLUSION: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction. Monitoring of patient satisfaction in emergency settings may contribute to improvements of quality of care.

TI  - Two-generation reproductive toxicity study of dietary tributyl phosphate in CD rats.  
AB  - Tributyl phosphate (TBP) was tested for reproductive toxicity in rats. Thirty weanlings/sex (F0) were exposed to TBP in the diet ad libitum at 0, 200, 700, or 3000 ppm for 10 weeks and then randomly mated within groups for 3 weeks with continued exposure. F0 parents and 10 F1 weanlings/sex/dose were necropsied, and adult reproductive organs, urinary bladders (both sexes), kidneys (males), and livers (females) were evaluated histologically. Thirty F1 weanlings/sex/dose continued exposure for 11 weeks and were bred as described above. F1 parents and F2 weanlings, 10/sex/dose, were then necropsied as described above. Adult toxicity was observed in both sexes and generations at 700 and 3000 ppm; observations included reduced body weights, weight gain and feed consumption, urinary bladder epithelial hyperplasia (both sexes), renal pelvis epithelial hyperplasia only at 3000 ppm (male kidneys), and centrilobular hypertrophy (female livers). At 200 ppm, transient reductions in body weight were observed in F0 and F1 females, with urinary bladder epithelial hyperplasia in F0 males and females and in F1 males. There was no evidence of reproductive toxicity, of reproductive organ pathology, or of effects on gestation or lactation at any dose tested. Postnatal toxicity was evidenced by consistent reductions in F1 and F2 pup body weights at 3000 ppm and by occasional weight reductions in F2 litters at 700 ppm, and was associated with maternal toxicity observed at these doses and times. Under the conditions of this study, a NOAEL was not determined for adult toxicity; the NOAEL for reproductive toxicity was at least 3000 ppm and the NOAEL for postnatal toxicity was approximately 200 ppm.

TI  - Quantitative MR volumetry in Alzheimer's disease. Topographic markers and the effects of sex and education.  
AB  - We determined topographic selectivity and diagnostic utility of brain atrophy in probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlations with demographic factors such as age, sex, and education. Computerized imaging analysis techniques were applied to MR images in 32 patients with probable AD and 20 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects using tissue segmentation and three-dimensional surface rendering to obtain individualized lobar volumes, corrected for head size by a residualization technique. Group differences emerged in gray and white matter compartments particularly in parietal and temporal lobes. Logistic regression demonstrated that larger parietal and temporal ventricular CSF compartments and smaller temporal gray matter predicted AD group membership with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92. On multiple regression analysis using age, sex, education, duration, and severity of cognitive decline to predict regional atrophy in the AD subjects, sex consistently entered the model for the frontal, temporal, and parietal ventricular compartments. In the parietal region, for example, sex accounted for 27% of the variance in the parietal CSF compartment and years of education accounted for an additional 15%, with women showing less ventricular enlargement and individuals with more years of education showing more ventricular enlargement in this region. Topographic selectivity of atrophic changes can be detected using quantitative volumetry and can differentiate AD from normal aging. Differential effects of sex and years of education can also be detected by these methods. Quantification of tissue volumes in vulnerable regions offers the potential for monitoring longitudinal change in response to treatment.

TI  - Discriminative power of the health status questionnaire 12 in relation to age, sex, and longstanding illness: findings from a survey of households in Great Britain.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of the health status questionnaire 12 (HSQ-12) to discriminate between older and younger age groups, its appropriateness for use with an older population in terms of the spread of responses across categories, floor or ceiling effects, and its ability to discriminate between those with and without a reported longstanding illness and type (sensitivity and specificity). DESIGN AND SETTING: The vehicle for the study was the Office for National Statistics (ONS) omnibus survey in Great Britain. The sampling frame was the British post-code address file of "small users", stratified by region, and socioeconomic factors. This file includes all private household addresses. The postal sectors were selected with probability proportional to size. Within each sector 30 addresses were selected randomly. The number of selected addresses was 3000. PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 1912 adults aged 16 and over were interviewed in person in their own homes, giving a response rate of 72%. MEASURES: The HSQ-12, and the ONS general household survey questions on longstanding illness; the ONS omnibus standard sociodemographic items. MAIN RESULTS: There were exceptionally high rates of item response in all age groups. The score differences by construct (e.g., age group, sex, longstanding illness) were in the expected directions with statistically significant age gradients. Age was associated with most of the HSQ-12 domains, although this association had interactions with longstanding illness or sex. The differences in HSQ-12 scores with reported longstanding illness and type of longstanding illness made theoretical sense, which supports the discriminative power of the scale. The frequency distributions for HSQ-12 items in relation to age and sex, and by reporting of longstanding illness are also presented here in order to demonstrate ceiling effects. Most respondents in all age groups achieved high (good) scores on the "social functioning" subscale. The HSQ-12 had good results for specificity when tested against reporting of a longstanding illness, although this was at the expense of sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the HSQ-12 with older populations, particularly for those with chronic illnesses, although it will reveal relatively few problems among younger populations. The results presented here indicate that it will require supplementation with more sensitive disease and/or domain specific scales in the areas of interest or intervention, but it provides an acceptable, brief, core measure of health related quality of life. This paper present the first British normative data using the HSQ-12.

TI  - The advantage of sex in the RNA virus phi6.  
AB  - When laboratory populations of the RNA bacteriophage phi6 are subjected to intensified genetic drift, they experience a decline in fitness. These experiments demonstrate that the average effect of mutations is deleterious, and they are used to suggest that Muller's ratchet can operate in these viruses. However, the operation of Muller's ratchet does not alone guarantee an advantage of sex. When phi6 populations were subjected to a series of bottlenecks of one individual and then crossed, the measured advantage of sex was not significant. To determine whether a small sample size, as opposed to allelism or another explanation, can account for the negative result, we repeated the phi6 experiments by crossing a larger set of populations. We found that bottlenecked populations of phi6 could recover fitness through mutations. However, hybrids produced by crossing the populations recovered an additional amount over the contribution of mutations. This additional amount, which represents an advantage of sex to phi6, was determined to be significantly greater than zero. These results provide indirect support for an advantage of sex through Muller's ratchet. However, we also use our experimental design and results to propose an alternative to Muller's ratchet as a model for the evolution of sex.

TI  - Anger expression, age, and blood pressure in modernizing Samoan adults [published erratum appears in Psychosom Med 1998 Mar-Apr;60(2):162]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Relationships among anger expression, age, and blood pressure (BP) were studied in a cross-sectional sample of 593 American and Western Samoan adult men and women, 25 to 55 years of age. Prior studies indicated that anger coping is an important psychosocial domain in modernizing Samoans. METHODS: Anger expression was assessed using a modified 24-item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory composed of anger-in, anger-out, and anger-control, along with 4 Samoan culture-specific anger items. Age and sex stratified analyses were performed. Body-mass adjusted BP was regressed on the anger expression subscales and age. RESULTS: In women < or = 40 years of age, anger-out was significantly (p < 0.01) and negatively related to adjusted diastolic BP. Young women from American and Western Samoa who outwardly expressed anger least frequently had higher adjusted diastolic BP. CONCLUSION: The significant influence of anger expression on BP in young modernizing Samoan women may be because: a) increased stress from the interaction of traditional gender role-related domestic demands and more opportunities for individual socioeconomic activities; and b) the culturally normative pattern of suppressed emotional expression.

TI  - Age-related response to interferon alfa treatment in women vs men with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferon alfa is used widely for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Little is known, however, of the relationship between patients' sex and the effectiveness of interferon alfa treatment in these patients. METHODS: We treated 311 patients (199 men and 112 women) with human lymphoblastoid interferon (6 million units subcutaneously every day for 2 weeks and 3 times a week for 22 weeks) and observed them for an additional 6 months. Serum HCV RNA levels and genotype were tested by polymerase chain reaction before treatment. A liver biopsy was also done. For the purposes of this study, a complete response was defined as the elimination of HCV RNA for at least 6 months after the termination of treatment. RESULTS: The rate of complete response was 27.1% for men and 24.1% for women. With multiple logistic regression analysis, the HCV RNA level (P < .001), genotype (P < .001), patients' sex (P < .05), and the interaction between sex and age were associated with a complete response to interferon alfa. The rate of complete response was 33.3% in men aged 39 years and younger, 25.0% in men aged 40 years and older. 75.0% in women aged 39 years and younger, and 15.6% in women aged 40 years and older. The odds ratio by group was 1.00, 0.72, 4.38, and 0.21, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that women aged 39 years and younger are responsive to interferon alfa treatment suggests that hormonal activity, in particular the level of estrogen, may be associated with the sustained elimination of HCV.

TI  - Primary human muscle satellite cell culture: variations of cell yield, proliferation and differentiation rates according to age and sex of donors, site of muscle biopsy, and delay before processing.  
AB  - The present study was performed to determine the influence on human satellite cell yield, proliferation, and differentiation rates of: 1) sex and age of donors; 2) site of the muscle biopsy; and 3) delay before processing of the muscle biopsy sample. We used a standardized primary muscle cell culture procedure on 206 normal muscle samples obtained from different muscle groups of patients aged from 20 to 88 years, at time of orthopedic surgery. Sex of donors did not influence muscle culture parameters. In contrast, aging tended to affect muscle cell yield (age group 50-59 years vs 70-79 years, P < 0.08), but not myogenic cell abilities to proliferate and to fuse into myotubes. The anatomic origin of muscle samples used for culture appeared to influence culture parameters. In contrast with other tested muscles, the tensor fasciae muscle gave both a good cell yield (174 +/- 25 10(3) cells per gram) and homogeneous proliferation and differentiation rates. Storage of the muscle sample at 4 degrees C in transport medium was associated with a very high cell yield when processing was done in early hours after biopsy (277 +/- 50 10(3) cells/g), a high and stable cell yield when processing was done from day 1 to day 3 after biopsy (185 +/- 15 10(3) cells/g), and a poor cell yield when processing was done after day 4 (111 +/- 13 10(3) cells/g). Storage of muscle biopsy samples at 4 degrees C for 1 to 4 days was associated with good proliferation and fusion rates. In conclusion, these data validate a convenient procedure of primary human muscle cell culture, using tensor fasciae muscle biopsy, which is easily done at time of orthopedic surgery, obtained from men and women of all ages (if possible less than 70 years to obtain good cell yield), and allowing of 1-3 days of storage before processing that may compensate uncertainty of the exact time of availability of muscle samples for the scientist.

TI  - [Epidemiology of osteoporotic hip fractures in the province of Zamora (1993)]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify epidemiological aspects of the osteoporotic hip fractures (OHF) in the province of Zamora in 1993, and the basic and standardised accumulative incidence rates amongst the Spanish population. METHODS: 215 OHF cases were studied in the province throughout 1993, 203 were admitted to hospital, 188 of which were treated surgically by the Traumatology Department. The surveyed variables were: sex, age, location (rural, urban), type of (cervical, trochanteric) fracture, surgical procedure (partial prosthesis. Ender stems, others), seasonal factors and average hospital stay. RESULTS: Global accumulative incidence: 100.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. With respect to people over 50, the rate was 246.5 per 100,000 inhabitants (according to the 1991 census). Female predominance (3.78:1). Average age: 81.3 +/- 8.8 years. 50% distribution of fracture type, both at global and female level. Dual incidence of trochanteric fracture suffered by males. Average stay: 15.35 days. Standardised accumulative incidence according to age and sex for the Spanish population in 1991 would be 202.99 fractures per 100,000 inhabitants and year, which would result in a total number of 23,740 fractures per year. CONCLUSIONS: The province of Zamora currently has one of the highest rates of OHF in Spain, both with respect to overall population as well as people over 50 years of age. Average age, predominance of the female sex, distribution of the type of fracture and average hospital stay are similar to the figures published in our country.

TI  - Psychological distress among female sex workers.  
AB  - The prevalence and correlates of psychological distress were examined in a sample of 171 female sex workers in Queensland. It was found that 28 per cent were above the GHQ-28 threshold for mild psychiatric morbidity, a rate that is not appreciably different from that of women in the general community. The sample included only eight street sex workers, all of whom reported significant distress. Logistic regression analyses showed that a history of injecting drug use, an early age at leaving home and wanting to leave the sex industry were independent predictors of poor mental health.  Distressed sex workers reported fewer sexual health examinations and less consistent condom use with their clients than those who were not distressed.

TI  - A PCR-RFLP method for the detection of Helicobacter hepaticus in frozen or fixed liver from B6C3F1 mice.  
AB  - Establishing the diagnosis of Helicobacter hepaticus infection in mouse liver has recently become important for the interpretation of rodent carcinogenicity bioassays. A seminested primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in combination with a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was designed to identify and distinguish H. hepaticus from H. muridarum and H. bilis in mouse liver. The PCR-RFLP assay was applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and, when available, corresponding frozen liver tissues from male and female B6C3F1 mice with or without histologic evidence of infection from various National Toxicology Program 2-yr bioassay studies. PCR products consistent with H. hepaticus were detected in 10-80% of livers from mice in studies with other evidence of infection that were frozen or fixed for less than 24 hr but not in liver fixed for several weeks. The sensitivity of the PCR-RFLP assay for H. hepaticus on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse liver varied between studies from markedly decreased when compared to the results from frozen liver or histologic evaluation to nearly equivalent or more sensitive than histologic evaluation. The PCR-RFLP results appeared dependent on the duration of fixation and bacterial load but not on the presence of hepatitis, sampling from neoplastic or nonneoplastic liver, or sex of the mouse.

TI  - Dimensions of risk behaviors among American Indian youth.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the covariation of risk behaviors in a national sample of American Indian reservation-based youth using listwise principal components factor analysis and to determine how these risk behaviors may vary by age and sex. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the National Indian Adolescent Health Survey, a validated anonymous self-report questionnaire of 162 items addressing various health domains. SETTING: The survey was administered nationally in more than 200 reservation-based schools. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred twenty-three reservation-based American Indian or Alaska Native students in grade 7 through 12 representing more than 50 tribes. The listwise factor analysis sample included 7687 respondents with complete data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item loading and factor correlations by age and sex for 30 risk behaviors across various health domains. RESULTS: Three risk behavior factors were fairly stable across sex and age: (1) the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; (2) risky sexual behavior, and (3) suicidal behaviors. Correlations between these and other factors suggested different strengths of relationships by sex and age. Other factors, including violence, truancy, and delinquency, showed differences in item loading on factors and correlations between factors. The use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs was most frequently associated with other risk behavior factors, and suicidal behaviors showed the next highest frequency of intercorrelations. CONCLUSIONS: There are sex and age differences in the covariation of risk behaviors, and suicidal behaviors should be further investigated to determine of our findings are unique to American Indian youth. Health interventions that focus categorically on 1 risk dimension should also emphasize substance use prevention and intervention. To prevent substance abuse among American Indian youth, research efforts need to focus on effective strategies for coping with social and psychological stressors.

TI  - Bone mineral density in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 of recent onset.  
AB  - There is still controversy over the impact of diabetes control and duration on bone mass and growth parameters in children and adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The aim of this study was to assess bone mineral density (BMD) at axial and appendicular sites, in children with noncomplicated IDDM of recent onset, and its relation to metabolic control and auxological parameters (weight, height, and puberal stage). Fifty-five young Spanish IDDM, otherwise healthy patients (26 males, aged (SD 9.7 +/- 4.3 years) and 29 females, aged (SD 11.2 +/- 3.8 years) were studied. Duration of diabetes was 1-13.8 years. Two hundred eighty-two age-matched, healthy, Spanish children served as controls. HbA1 was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) densitometry at the spine and forearm. Results showed a Gaussian BMD distribution of patients according to sex and age, without sexual-stage differences. There was no correlation between BMD and glycated hemoglobin (average life disease or last HbA1 values) or duration of the disease; moreover, no differences in bone mass were found between <3 and >/=3 years of disease duration. Diabetes impact index (mean HbA1 x duration of disease in months) showed no significant influence of diabetes control on BMD. We could not demonstrate any impact of diabetes on BMD and growth parameters in children with IDDM of short duration.

TI  - Age- and sex-specific HIV-1 prevalence in the urban community setting of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the age and sex-specific prevalence of HIV infection in the population of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. DESIGN: Two-stage cluster sampling of the population aged 0-49 years of Addis Ababa, using kebeles (urban dwelling associations) as clusters. METHODS: The sera used for this study were collected in an earlier study (1994) on the rate of acquisition of antibodies against measles, rubella, and hepatitis B. After separate approvals were obtained from the institutional ethics committees, sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed by Western blot. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence rates were estimated. The prevalence of HIV in men and women over 15 years of age was compared by calculating age-standardized HIV prevalence, using the age distribution of the census population as the standard. A time-dependent catalytic model was used to obtain crude estimates of HIV incidence from age-prevalence data. RESULTS: A total of 3853 sera were available for analysis. The prevalence of HIV in adults was 6.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.5-7.4%] for men and 6.9% (95% CI, 5.3-8.5%) for women, with peak prevalence in the 25-29 year age group of 16.3 and 11.8%, respectively. After standardization for age using the direct method, the HIV prevalence ratio comparing adult men with women was 0.97:1 (95% CI, 0.70:1 - 1.35:1). Three children aged less than 5 years were HIV-positive. The prevalence of HIV among adults ranged from 0-21.3% in different clusters, indicating the heterogeneity of the spread of HIV in the city. HIV prevalence estimates among the antenatal clinic patients of Addis Ababa in 1996 far exceeded the estimates obtained during the community survey, particularly in the youngest age group (15-24 years). Estimates of HIV incidence (per susceptible person per annum) for the age group 16-22 years ranged from 1.3-2.25% for men and from 2.1-2.4% for women. CONCLUSION: By 1994, a substantial proportion of the adult population of Addis Ababa was infected with HIV. Promotion of behavioural changes and the control of sexually transmitted diseases should be strongly supported to limit the spread of the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia.

TI  - The importance of social condition in the hormonal and behavioral responses to an acute social stressor in the male Siberian dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus).  
AB  - Social condition is an important factor in determining the behavioral and hormonal responses to a social stressor in the Siberian dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus). We predict that males housed with a female or a family (female and pups) will show an increase in the magnitude of the behavioral and hormonal responses to a male intruder compared to those of individually housed males. Three treatment groups were studied: individually housed males that had been previously group-housed in same-sex colonies (males, n = 10), males housed with a female (male + female, n = 9), and males housed with their female and pups (male + family, n = 12). Males were monitored for aggressive behavior toward an intruder male for 10 min. Blood samples were taken at baseline and after the encounter. Male + female and male + family groups spent more time in aggressive behavior (P < 0.05), such as attacking (P < 0.05) and fighting (P < 0.05), than did individually housed males. These same groups showed significant increases in plasma cortisol after the encounter (P < 0.01) whereas there were no significant increases in plasma cortisol in solitary males. All groups showed significantly lower levels of plasma testosterone (male, P < 0.001, male + female, P < 0.05; male + family, P < 0.01) whereas a significant increase in prolactin occurred only in the male + family group (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between postencounter cortisol levels and total number of minutes spent in aggressive behavior (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the introduction of a novel intruder male results in an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and a suppression of the reproductive axis. Furthermore, pairing of a male with a female alters the behavioral and hormonal responses to an intruder male.

TI  - Antioxidant enzyme activities in lens, liver and kidney of calorie restricted Emory mice.  
AB  - Dietary calorie restriction extends both mean and maximum life span and retards age-related diseases, including eye lens cataract in Emory mice. The beneficial effects of calorie restriction have been hypothesized to reflect enhanced tissue antioxidant capacity. As a test of this hypothesis, we reared male and female Emory mice on control (C) or 40% calorie-restricted (R) diets. We then determined activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT) in eye lens, liver and kidney of young (4.5 or 6 months), mature (11 or 12 months) and old (22 months) animals. Effects of diet, age and sex were evaluated by multi-factor ANOVA. Only kidney GR activities (mean +/- S.E.M.) were significantly enhanced with the R diet (R, 61 +/- 2 vs. C, 54 +/- 3 U/mg protein; P = 0.03). More frequently, we noted reduced antioxidant enzyme activity in R as compared with C animals, including reduced activities of T-SOD in lens, liver and kidney, Cu/Zn-SOD in liver and kidney, liver Mn-SOD and liver CAT (P < 0.05). Effects of age on antioxidant enzyme activity in C mice included age-dependent decreases in lens and kidney CAT and in liver Mn-SOD. There was also an age-dependent increases in liver and kidney Cu/Zn-SOD and liver GR. None of these age-dependent alterations in antioxidant enzyme function were attenuated in tissues of mice fed the R diet. Values for liver CAT were significantly lower in females than in males (P = 0.05). These results indicate that antioxidant enzyme activities in Emory mouse tissues are influenced by diet, age and sex. However, it is unlikely that increased lifespan and attenuation of cataract (and perhaps other age-dependent debilities), which are associated with the R diet in the Emory mouse, are due to enhanced antioxidant enzyme capabilities.

TI  - Ethnic differences in sexual decisions and sexual behavior.  
AB  - Previous investigators have reported ethnic differences in the expression of sexual decision making and sexual behaviors in women. In a sample of women of low socioeconomic status between ages 18 and 45, we examined the influence of ethnicity and other variables (age, education, marital status, and comfort in discussing sex) on (i) who makes decisions on the timing and type of sex, (ii) whether a woman engages in vaginal, oral, and anal sex, (iii) the frequencies of each type of sex, and (iv) whether or not a woman has multiple partners. Multivariate analyses showed that, independent of other independent variables, ethnicity had little direct effect on most variables. The notable exception was that ethnicity influenced joint decision making regarding the timing and type of sexual activities for Hispanic but not for African American women. We conclude that ethnicity contributes to differences in sexual behaviors but that other variables are equally important.

TI  - RET/NTRK1 rearrangements in thyroid gland tumors of the papillary carcinoma family: correlation with clinicopathological features.  
AB  - The papillary carcinoma family (PCF) of thyroid tumors includes a wide variety of neoplastic entities regarded as well-differentiated, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas. Recent studies have established the presence of alternative oncogenic rearrangements of the RET and NTRK1 genes in a consistent fraction (< or = 50%) of papillary thyroid tumors. RET oncogenic rearrangements are also very frequent (approximately 60%) in Chernobyl radiation-associated papillary thyroid neoplasias, which show an increased aggressiveness in terms of pathological stage at disease onset. These observations prompted us to study the relationship between the presence or absence of RET and NTRK1 oncogenes and the clinicopathological features (age, sex, histopathology, and pTNMC2 staging) of 76 consecutive, non-radiation-related tumors of the PCF. As previously reported, statistical univariate analysis revealed a correlation between the combination of RET and NTRK1 (RET/NTRK1) positivity and young age of patients at diagnosis. In addition, a significant association was found between RET/NTRK1 positivity and locally advanced stage of disease at presentation (pT4: P < 0.015). The multivariate analysis confirmed that RET/NTRK1 activation parallels an unfavorable disease presentation, which may correlate with a less favorable disease outcome. Furthermore, within the PCF, the frequency of RET/NTRK1 positivity was not influenced by the different neoplastic subtypes or the tumor versus degree of differentiation.

TI  - Rearing with males accelerates onset of sexual maturity in female domestic fowl.  
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of male presence on sexual maturation and sexual responses toward humans in laying strain females. In Experiment 1, two flocks of 50 medium-hybrid females were reared without males (separate-sex) and two flocks with males (mixed-sex) from 1 d of age. Mixed-sex females came into lay sooner and laid more eggs up to 22 wk of age than separate-sex females (P < 0.05). Comb size was also greater in mixed-sex females at 15 and 20 wk of age (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, six replicate groups per treatment with n = 10 females per group were reared in separate-sex, mixed-sex, or adjacent to mixed-sex groups. Rearing adjacent to mixed-sex groups, which allowed visual and auditory contact with males, was just as effective for accelerating sexual maturation as was rearing in mixed-sex groups. Females reared in and adjacent to mixed-sex groups began to lay earlier (P < 0.05) and had larger combs (P < 0.05) than separate-sex females. However, after 22 wk of age, egg production rates of separate-sex females surpassed those of mixed-sex and adjacent females, resulting in similar numbers of eggs produced through 30 wk of age (P > 0.10). During tests for sexual responsiveness to humans, over 80% of females in separate-sex and adjacent to mixed-sex groups assumed a sexual crouch, whereas less than 20% of females in mixed-sex groups crouched (P < 0.001, chi-square). The degree of contact with males during rearing affected the females' physiological measures of reproductive function differently than behavioral measures.

TI  - Lifestyle, stress, and genes in peptic ulcer disease: a nationwide twin cohort study [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The familial accumulation of peptic ulcer disease observed in several studies may be attributable to genetic effects, aggregation of environmental exposure (shared environment), or both. The intrafamilial spread of Helicobacter pylori infection has raised the question whether shared environment could explain the familial aggregation of peptic ulcer disease rather than genetic similarity of family members. OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease in a nationwide population-based cohort of adult twins. METHODS: The Finnish Twin Cohort consists of all same-sexed twin pairs born before 1958 with both twins alive in 1975. The total number of twin pairs is 13888, of whom 4307 are monozygotic (MZ) and 9581 are dizygotic (DZ) twins. Questionnaire surveys of twins were carried out in 1975, 1981, and 1990, including medical and psychosocial questions. One question asked whether a physician had ever made a diagnosis of gastric or duodenal ulcer. In addition, hospital discharge data from 1972 to 1991 were linked with the twin cohort to obtain those twin individuals who had been treated for gastric or duodenal ulcer. The prevalence of and concordance for peptic ulcer disease were examined in MZ and DZ twins. Model-fitting analysis was used to specify the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors. The contribution of lifestyle factors and stress was examined prospectively in an incidence study and by comparison of discordant pairs. RESULTS: The prevalence of peptic ulcer disease was 6.2% in men and 2.8% in women in 1975. There were 63 MZ and 86 DZ pairs concordant for peptic ulcer disease. Concordance for disease was significantly higher in MZ than in DZ twin pairs; the probandwise concordance rate was 23.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.9%-26.3%) in MZ twins and 14.8% (95% CI, 13.3%-16.3%) in DZ twins. In the model-fitting analysis, a model with both additive genetic and unshared environmental effects had the best goodness-of-fit. Thirty-nine percent (95% CI, 32%-47%) of the liability to peptic ulcer disease was explained by genetic factors and 61% (95% CI, 53%-68%) by individual environmental factors. In the incidence study (logistic regression analysis of the entire cohort initially free of peptic ulcer disease, with subjects diagnosed as having peptic ulcer after 1975 as cases), current smoking (relative risk, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.2) and high stress levels (relative risk, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.6) in men and regular use of analgesics (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1) in women predicted peptic ulcer disease during the follow-up from 1976 to 1991. In the analysis of discordant pairs, smoking in men and regular use of analgesics in both sexes were predictors of peptic ulcer disease. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire and hospital usage data on peptic ulcer disease in the population-based twin cohort suggest that the familial aggregation of the disease is modest, and attributable almost solely to genetic factors. Environmental effects not shared by family members were significant predictors of disease, and they were attributable to smoking and stress in men and the use of analgesics in women. The minor effects of shared environment to disease liability do not support the concept that the clustering of risk factors, such as H pylori infection, would explain the familial accumulation of peptic ulcer disease.

TI  - HIV infection and risk factors among female sex workers in southern Vietnam.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent of HIV infection among female commercial sex workers (CSW), to identify risk factors, and to provide baseline data for developing and targeting prevention measures. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 968 female CSW were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from August 1995 to October 1996. Information was obtained from confidential face-to-face interview, physical examination, and laboratory testing. RESULTS: A total of 65.5% of female CSW reported inconsistent condom use. Overall seroprevalence was 5.2%. The highest seroprevalence (9.5%) was detected in An Giang province, a border area adjacent to Cambodia. Out of seven HIV isolates in An Giang province, six were characterized as Thai subtype E and one as subtype B. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an independent significant association between HIV seroprevalence and the following: age < or = 30 years [odds ratio (OR), 5.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-15.2]; high frequency of sex (> 20 times per week; OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 3.6-50.2); inconsistent condom use (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.01-8.0; sign of genital ulcers (OR, 18.1; 95% CI, 1.8-182); venereal warts (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 2.5-33.0); brothels as sex venue (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 2.0-24.3); and working at the border area (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.4-11.0). Brothels as work-sites were significantly related to inconsistent condom use and the socioeconomic background of clients. Only 0.5% of CSW reported injecting drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Female CSW at brothels who reported inconsistent condom use and ulcerous sexually transmitted disease, particularly in the border area with Cambodia, had greater risk of HIV infection. Brothels were more frequently used as sex venues in the border area and were more likely to be visited by occasional clients who were difficult to access. Drug use among female CSW in this region was rare. The development of prevention measures should be based on these results.

TI  - Patient satisfaction with dentures made by dentists and denturologists [published erratum appears in J Can Dent Assoc 1998 May;64(5):346]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, patients requiring removable prostheses consult either dentists or denturologists. In this article, we describe the socioeconomic characteristics of 410 edentulous individuals seeking replacement of their dentures, and compare the levels of satisfaction experienced by the patient groups provided with conventional dentures by dentists and by denturologists. METHODS: All subjects responded to announcements seeking participants in a clinical trial. The announcements indicated that all participants would receive new prostheses. Data were collected via telephone interviews. Sociodemographic variables included sex, age, education level and family income. Subjects were asked to evaluate their present maxillary and mandibular prostheses for general satisfaction, stability, comfort, ability to chew, ability to clean and appearance. Age, cost and the provider (dentist or denturologist) of the original prostheses were also recorded, and responses were then compared between the groups of subjects treated by dentists (N = 91) and denturologists (N = 319). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the two groups, except for a small difference in mean age (two years). Both groups had paid approximately the same amount for their complete prostheses. As expected, most individuals were satisfied with their maxillary prostheses, but dissatisfied with their mandibular prostheses. Significantly more subjects in the denturologist treatment group than the dentist treatment group gave their mandibular prostheses a poor rating for general satisfaction (p = 0.003), comfort (p = 0.04) and stability (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the edentulous patients treated by dentists and denturologists share similar sociodemographic characteristics, and pay a similar cost for treatment. However, those treated by denturologists seem to be more dissatisfied with their mandibular prostheses than those treated by dentists.

TI  - Antidepressant prescribing practices of outpatient psychiatrists.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors examined recent changes in the number and proportion of patients prescribed antidepressants by psychiatrists in outpatient private practice and characterized antidepressant prescription patterns by patient age, sex, race, payment source, and clinical diagnosis. METHODS: The authors analyzed physician-reported data from the 1985 and 1993-1994 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, focusing on visits to physicians specializing in psychiatry. Logistic regressions were used to examine associations between survey year and antidepressant prescription, adjusting for the presence of other variables. RESULTS: The proportion of outpatient psychiatric visits in which an antidepressant was prescribed increased from 23.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.7%-26.5%) in 1985 to 48.6% (95% CI, 47.5%-49.7%) in 1993-1994. After controlling for several patient variables, psychiatric patients were approximately 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8-2.9) times more likely to receive an antidepressant in 1993-1994 than in 1985. In 1993-1994, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors accounted for approximately half of the psychiatric visits with an antidepressant prescription. Increases in the rate of antidepressant prescription were particularly evident for children and young adults; whites; new patients; and patients with adjustment disorders, personality disorders, depression not otherwise specified or dysthymia, and some anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a significant increase in the prescription of antidepressants by office-based psychiatrists. This increase was greatest for patients with less severe psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Do distal arteriovenous fistulae improve patency rates of prosthetic infrapopliteal arterial bypasses?  
AB  - We retrospectively analyzed if distal anastomotic adjunctive arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) improved patency rates of prosthetic bypasses to infrapopliteal arteries. Between July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1996, we performed 43 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypasses to infrapopliteal (19 peroneal, 13 anterior tibial, 11 posterior tibial) arteries. All bypasses were performed for limb salvage when autologous vein was not available for a conduit. Adjunctive AVFs were performed in 21 bypasses (PTFE-AVF) and 22 bypasses did not have a fistula (PTFE-ONLY). Patients were allocated to the PTFE-AVF or PTFE-ONLY groups at the discretion of the surgeons, with adjunctive AVFs being performed for small arteries with poor run-off. There were no significant differences in age, sex, site of the proximal anastomosis, or indication for surgery (p > 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in the site of distal anastomosis and quality of arterial run-off based on the Society for Vascular Surgery Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards criteria (p < 0.05). All patients were placed on heparin 500 units/hour postoperatively, maintained on life-long Coumadin and followed every 3 months with duplex ultrasonography to assess graft patency. Aggressive intervention was carried out for failing grafts suspected by duplex scanning. The hospital mortality rate was 2.3% (1/43; 1 PTFE-AVF). Two-year primary patency rates were significantly better for PTFE-AVF grafts than for PTFE-ONLY grafts (23% versus 5%) (p = 0.04). Although statistical significance was not reached, there was a suggestion of higher assisted primary (34% versus 15%) (p > 0.05) and secondary (61% versus 48%) (p > 0.05) patency rates in the PTFE-AVF group versus the PTFE-ONLY group, although limb salvage rates were similar (74% versus 71%) (p > 0.05). Two AVFs required ligation because of steal resulting in diminished distal perfusion. These results support the use of adjunctive distal AVFs to improve overall two-year patency rates of prosthetic infrapopliteal arterial bypasses.

TI  - EGL-17(FGF) expression coordinates the attraction of the migrating sex myoblasts with vulval induction in C. elegans.  
AB  - During the development of the egg-laying system in Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites, central gonadal cells organize the alignment of the vulva with the sex myoblasts, the progenitors of the egg-laying muscles. A fibroblast growth factor [EGL-17(FGF)] and an FGF receptor [EGL-15(FGFR)] are involved in the gonadal signals that guide the migrations of the sex myoblasts. Here we show that EGL-17(FGF) can act as an instructive guidance cue to direct the sex myoblasts to their final destinations. We find that egl-17 reporter constructs are expressed in the primary vulval cell and that EGL-17(FGF) expression in this cell correlates with the precise positioning of the sex myoblasts. We postulate that EGL-17(FGF) helps to coordinate the development of a functional egg-laying system, linking vulval induction with proper sex myoblast migration.

AB  - Today, there are significant risks to the health of teenagers. Drugs (tobacco, alcohol, steroids and others), sex (pregnancy, STDs, date rape), nutrition (obesity and eating disorders), and violence (abuse, fighting) are unfortunately a part of many teens' lives. These risks increase throughout the teen years. Since each risk has a strong behavioral component, we hope to modify the behavior and minimize the risk. Prevention and health promotion are an important part of health care for teens. Primary care providers, such as family physicians, are in an excellent position to provide teen preventative care that is comprehensive and specific to the needs of each teen.

TI  - Pediatric wound infections: a prospective multicenter study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical wound infections remain a significant source of postoperative morbidity. This study was undertaken to determine prospectively the incidence of postoperative wound infections in children in a multi-institutional fashion and to identify the risk factors associated with the development of a wound infection in this population. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite a large body of literature in adults, there have been only two reports from North America concerning postoperative wound infections in children. METHODS: All infants and children undergoing operation on the pediatric surgical services of three institutions during a 17-month period were prospectively followed for 30 days after surgery for the development of a wound infection. RESULTS: A total of 846 of 1021 patients were followed for 30 days. The overall incidence of wound infection was 4.4%. Factors found to be significantly associated with a postoperative wound infection were the amount of contamination at operation (p = 0.006) and the duration of the operation (p = 0.03). Comparing children who developed a wound infection with those who did not, there were no significant differences in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) preoperative assessment score, length of preoperative hospitalization, location of operation (intensive care unit vs. operating room), presence of a coexisting disease or remote infection, or the use of perioperative antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that wound infections in children are related more to the factors at operation than to the overall physiologic status. Procedures can be performed in the intensive care unit without any increase in the incidence of wound infection.

TI  - Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate in NIDDM patients from plasma creatinine concentration after cimetidine administration.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be estimated in patients with renal disease from plasma creatinine concentration, age, sex, and body weight according to the formula of Cockcroft and Gault. The hypothesis that this method can be improved when tubular secretion of creatinine is inhibited by cimetidine was studied in NIDDM patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 30 outpatients with NIDDM and normo- (n = 10), micro- (n = 9), or macroalbuminuria (n = 11), GFR was measured as the urinary clearance during continuous infusion of 125I-labeled iothalamate. Plasma creatinine concentration was analyzed with an enzymatic assay before and after 800 mg t.i.d. oral cimetidine was given during a 24-h period. RESULTS: Plasma creatinine rose in all patients after cimetidine administration and, as a consequence, the clearance calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula fell. The ratio of this formula and GFR decreased from 1.16 +/- 0.20 to 0.97 +/- 0.16 (means +/- SD). This ratio tended to be smaller in the normo- (0.93) than in the micro- (0.98) and macroalbuminuric (1.00) groups. Also, 20 patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 had a smaller ratio than those with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 (0.92 vs. 1.07; P < 0.05). Bland and Altman analysis showed a difference of the Cockcroft-Gault formula and GFR of 12.0 +/- 17.4 ml.min-1 (1.73 m2)-1, which decreased to -3.8 +/- 14.8 ml.min-1.(1.73 m2)-1. The same analysis of 24-h creatinine clearance with urine collection and GFR showed larger standard deviations. CONCLUSIONS: GFR can be estimated in an acceptable way from plasma creatinine concentration after cimetidine administration in outpatients with NIDDM. Despite a nonsignificant underestimation in normoalbuminuric and overestimation in overweighted patients, this method is superior to 24-h creatinine clearance with outpatient urine collection.

TI  - Sister chromatid exchange and micronucleus frequency in human lymphocytes of 1,650 subjects in an Italian population: II. Contribution of sex, age, and lifestyle.  
AB  - Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) analysis was carried out on 1,650 healthy individuals living in Pisa and in two nearby small cities, Cascina and Navacchio (Ca-Na). The effect of smoking on SCEs was linearly correlated with the number of cigarettes per day, and an increase of 7.3% SCEs was detectable for as few cigarettes as 1-10/day. Ex-smokers showed intermediate mean values of SCEs (8.09 +/- 1.88) in comparison with never smokers (7.54 +/- 1.61) and current smokers (8.45 +/- 1.94). Mean values of SCEs of ex-smokers decreased linearly with time of smoking cessation, reaching the mean values of never smokers within 8 years. The extent of SCE decrease was inversely proportional to the number of cigarettes previously smoked. No interaction between smoking habits and coffee or alcohol drinking on SCEs was observed. A borderline (P = 0.053) increase in mean SCE values in coffee drinkers (more than 3 cups/day) was found. The age effect on SCEs was remarkable in Ca-Na, but not in Pisa donors. Job type was not associated with significant modification of mean values of SCEs. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between the proportion of high frequency cells (HCF) outliers and coffee consumption. Age and sex appeared to be by far the most important variables associated with modifications in MN frequency, which increased by 0.04 per thousand and 0.02 per thousand per year in males and females, respectively. Children and young donors (age < or = 40 years) showed lower MN frequency regardless of sex, whereas sex appeared to determine a significantly higher increase of MN only in females older than 40 years. In contrast, in males the MN rate by age tended to level off after the age of 30-50. MN frequencies of Pisa blue- and white-collar workers were statistically significantly higher than in students (+0.71 and +0.55 per thousand, respectively). Smoking did not determine any increase of MN frequency. A total lack of correlation (P = 0.913) between MN and SCEs was observed.

TI  - Nasopharyngeal flora in HIV seropositive men who have sex with men.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess, in men who were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who identified themselves as having had sex with men; the nasopharyngeal prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N meningitidis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and candida species; oral sexual behaviour; the relation between oral flora and oral sexual behavior. METHOD: Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from HIV seropositive men for culture. The men were also asked to complete a self administered questionnaire. RESULTS: 390 men were recruited; 286 (73.3%) provided nasopharyngeal samples and questionnaires; 41 (10.5%) provided nasopharyngeal samples only; 63 (16.2%) provided questionnaires only. From the 327 nasopharyngeal samples N meningitidis was cultured in 49 (15%) and candida species in 165 (50.5%). Cultures for N gonorrhoeae and C diphtheriae were all negative. Data from the 349 completed questionnaires indicated that 285 men were practising oro-penile sex, over 90% did not consistently use condoms; 150 men were practising oro-anal sex, one used dental dams. In those providing both nasopharyngeal samples and sexual behaviour data meningococcal carriage was identified in 40 (17.5%) of the 228 men practising receptive oro-penile sex, compared with one (2.3%) of the 43 non-practisers (p < 0.025); in 21 (20%) of the 105 men practising insertive oro-anal sex, compared with 17 (12.5%) of the 136 non-practisers (p = 0.12). No correlation was identified between yeast carriage and oro-genital sex. Conclusion: Oro-genital sex, usually without barrier protection, is common among HIV infected men who have sex with men. It appears to be associated with increased meningococcal carriage but is autonomous to candida species isolation. Routine screening for nasopharyngeal N gonorrhoeae is not deemed necessary.

TI  - Retrospective review at skeletal maturity of the factors affecting the efficacy of Salter's innominate osteotomy in congenital dislocated, subluxed, and dysplastic hips.  
AB  - This study reviewed at skeletal maturity 180 congenitally dislocated, subluxed, and dysplastic hips in 122 patients treated by the same surgeon by using Salter's innominate osteotomy (IO). The mean follow-up was 12 years.  The sex of the patient, the laterality and height of the dislocation, the preoperative acetabular angle, the amount of femoral antetorsion, or the development of postoperative complications (except avascular necrosis of the femoral head), or a combination of these were not found to have a significant influence on the result. However, those patients who had a previous unsuccessful treatment of the hip, who developed pre- or postoperative avascular necrosis, who were unable to be restored by the osteotomy to a normal acetabular angle, or who required an open reduction of the hip joint (or who had a combination of these) were more likely to have an abnormal result. An important finding was that patients who underwent IO before age 4 years were the most likely candidates to receive a very satisfactory result.

TI  - Relationship between insulin resistance and partially oxidized LDL particles in healthy, nondiabetic volunteers.  
AB  - This study was performed in 36 healthy volunteers to define the relationship between plasma concentrations of partially oxidized low density lipoprotein (poxLDL), plasma glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose, and steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentrations after a 180-minute infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose. The concentration of poxLDL was estimated by determining the amount of conjugated dienes formed during in vitro LDL oxidation in the presence or absence of alanine. Under these conditions, the greater the in vitro antioxidant effect of alanine, the lower the amount of poxLDL that was present in plasma. The results demonstrated that plasma poxLDL concentration was significantly correlated with plasma glucose (r=.53, P<.001) and insulin (r=.43, P<.01) responses, SSPG concentrations (r=.53, P<.001), and plasma triglyceride (r=.42, P<.01) and HDL cholesterol (r=-.50, P<.002) concentrations. Furthermore, these relationships persisted when the data were corrected for differences in age, sex, body mass index, and the ratio of waist to hip girth. Of note, there was no correlation between poxLDL and LDL cholesterol concentration. When SSPG was entered along with age, sex, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio in a multiple regression model, SSPG alone was a significant prediction of poxLDL (r-=.37, P<.02). The addition of plasma glucose and insulin responses and triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations increased the r2 to only .47. These results show that the amount of poxLDL in plasma is significantly correlated with insulin resistance (ie, SSPG) and its metabolic consequences.

TI  - Differences in prescription drug utilization and expenditures between Blacks and Whites in the Georgia Medicaid population.  
AB  - To address policy concerns regarding prescription drug access by vulnerable minority groups, we analyzed prescription drug use and spending among black and white enrollees in the Georgia Medicaid program. Using a two-part model estimating use and level of use of any prescription drugs, the study examined black/white differences controlling for age, sex, and Medicaid eligibility characteristics. Results showed black enrollees were significantly less likely to use any prescription drugs and received significantly fewer prescriptions than white enrollees. After adjustment, the black/white difference for children was 43%, with black children using 2.7 fewer prescriptions relative to white children. Patterns of use were similar for adults and the elderly, with black adults using 4.9 fewer prescriptions, and black elders using 6.3 fewer prescriptions, than their white peers. Spending rates per full-year enrollee were similar to utilization patterns and maintained the black/white differential. White Medicaid enrollees had higher use and spending than black enrollees across most high-volume therapeutic drug categories. The study explores several possible explanations for these differences.

TI  - Monoclonal antibody therapy for resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer: seven-year outcome of a multicenter randomized trial.  
AB  - PURPOSE: As previously shown, antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C. Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time, we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody, 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n=99), or to observation only (n=90). Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval. Patients were stratified by a dynamic randomization according to center, sex, location of tumor, number of affected lymph nodes, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentration. RESULTS: Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors. After 7 years of follow-up evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P=.01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .04; log-rank, P=.07). The intention-to-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P=.02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P=.02; log-rank, P=.11 ). While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard, P=.004; log-rank, P=.004), local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard, P=.65; log-rank, P=.52). This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival. CONCLUSION: The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients. The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of a total cohort of female and male applicants for sex reassignment: a descriptive study.  
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the features of female-to-male transsexuals (F-M) with those of male-to-female transsexuals (M-F) in the cohort of all applicants for sex reassignment over a 20-year period. In an observational, cross-sectional design the cohort was retrospectively identified, consisting of all 233 subjects who applied for sex reassignment in Sweden during the period 1972-1992. The cohort was subdivided into the groups M-F (n=134) and F-M (n=99), and the two groups were compared. M-F were older when applying for sex reassignment surgery than F-M, and more often had a history of marriage and children than their F-M counterparts. M-F also had more heterosexual experience. F-M, on the other hand, more frequently exhibited cross-gender behaviour in childhood than did M-F transsexuals. The present and previous studies strongly support the view that transsexualism manifests itself differently in males and females. Various models for understanding these differences are discussed.

AB  - We evaluated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-Jo-1 antibodies in patients with polymyositis (PM) or dermatomyositis (DM) by use of the recombinant fusion protein Jo-1. Sera from 64 patients with PM or DM, from 80 patients with other connective tissue diseases, and from 64 healthy subjects matched for age, sex and race, were studied by the ELISA and by the double immunodiffusion (DID) method. Eight patients with myositis (six PM, one DM and one DM with malignancy) with positive anti-Jo-1 by DID also showed positive results by the ELISA method, whereas five patients with positive anti-Jo-1 by this ELISA showed negative results on DID. One of the five had non-specific results. The incidence of positive results for anti-Jo-1 with the ELISA (18.8%) was greater than that for DID (12.5%), but the difference was not statistically significant. All patients with positive results for anti-Jo-1 by DID were also positive by the ELISA. The ELISA system with the recombinant Jo-1 antigen was useful in the detection of anti-Jo-1 antibodies in patients with PM/DM.

We made the following observations: (1) the ages at which D1- and D2-like receptors were first expressed in whole forebrain sections could be reliably identified but were not significantly different from one another (gestational age 65 days for D1- vs. 72 days for D2-like receptors); (2) age-related increases in both D1- and D2-like receptors were demonstrated in forebrain and, from the middle of the first to the middle of the second trimester, the Bmax for each ligand increased by an order of magnitude after the onset of the specific binding site's expression; (3) age-related increases in D1-like receptors, but not D2-like receptors, could be demonstrated in cortex; and, (4) in one case of trisomy 18, the Bmax for [3H]-SCH23390 was significantly elevated above the 95% confidence interval when compared to an age-regressed normal sample. Although D2-like receptor density significantly increased with age in forebrain, age-regressed changes in D2-like receptor expression in cortex and striatum did not reach statistical significance. Likewise, a comparison of the mean Bmax's by sex for both ligands in midgestational striatum failed to reach significance. These data corroborate the findings of other investigators who have delineated the ontogeny of dopaminergic systems in other animal species. The regional differences in the expression of dopamine receptor families may be relevant to the role which dopamine may play during normal gestational brain development. Moreover, significant deviations in dopamine receptor expression during gestation (as seen in this one case of trisomy 18) may signify underlying pathological processes that ultimately are manifested by abnormal psychological development and/or cognitive functioning.

CSW knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and establishment policies concerning HIV prevention were assessed. Baseline assessments are part of an iterative process that will be used to modify the planned intervention. The preliminary findings point to the importance of an intervention that stresses changes in establishment policies and expectations as a means of reducing risk behaviours associated with HIV/STD transmission.

TI  - How early adolescents describe their dreams: a quantitative analysis.  
AB  - Most empirical research on dreams has focused on content and structure, while linguistic features have received far less attention. The present study investigated dream language in a critical developmental stage: early adolescence. Narratives of the dreams of 145 early adolescents were tape-recorded and transcribed, and the frequencies of various grammar forms and common words were calculated. The most common nouns for the entire sample were house and mother. The most frequent verbs were go and do. Males' dream narratives contained a greater number of such words as animal, long, enter, and kill. Females more often used intransitive verbs and such words as teacher, horse, and put. Several features differentiated older from younger early adolescents' dreams. The results indicate that linguistic features of dream narratives are affected by age and sex, displaying interesting parallels with clinical theories on dreams and early adolescence.

AB  - Cut throat injuries and associated deaths are common in our society. Majority succumb to their injuries. In this study, the hospital records of twenty six such cases (13 M & 13 F) were reviewed. Eleven victims were in their third decade. Eighteen cases came from poor socio-economic class. Eleven had suicidal, eleven homicidal and four accidental injuries. Familial troubles, psychiatric illness and poverty were the triggering factors in suicidal attempts. The motives of homicide included political conflict, sex related crimes, dacoity, familial, land related disputes, etc. All had their hypopharynx and/or larynx exposed. Tracheostomy was done in fifteen cases. All but two had uneventful recovery. One died in the hospital due to hemorrhage, shock and asphyxia from aspirated blood. It was observed that appropriate measures could save lives in vast majority.

TI  - Endocrine mechanisms underlying reproductive toxicity in the developing rat chronically exposed to dietary lead.  
AB  - A dose-response study was conducted in a rat model to examine the effects of lifetime lead exposure on the development of the reproductive system and the endocrine mechanisms underlying these effects. Time-impregnated female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-15/group) were exposed to lead acetate in the drinking water at levels of 0.05%, 0. 15%, or 0.45% (w/v) initiated on gestational day 5. At birth, litters were culled to four male and four female pups. Exposure of dams to lead was continued until weaning, following which, the pups continued to be exposed to lead acetate in drinking water until sacrifice. One male and one female pup from each litter were sacrificed at age 21, 35, 55, and 85 d. A significant dose-responsive decrease in birth weight and crown-to-rump length was observed in all lead-exposed litters. However, no marked effects were observed on anogenital distance/crown-to-rump length ratios. Lead exposure resulted in a delay in sexual maturity as measured by prostate weight in male pups and time of vaginal opening in female pups, which increased with lead dose. These disruptions in reproductive physiology were accompanied by a significant decrease in neonatal sex steroid levels and suppression of the plasma concentrations of testosterone (male) and estradiol (female) during puberty. In male pups, this was accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), elevated pituitary LH content, and a decrease in plasma testosterone/LH ratios at the highest dose. In female pups, although no effects were observed on plasma LH concentration, a similar significant elevation in pituitary LH content was observed during early puberty. Postpuberty, plasma LH and sex steroid concentrations were unaffected at any dose in spite of continued lead exposure. No significant effects were observed on epididymal sperm count in male pups at 85 d of age. In female pups, estrus cycling was only significantly disrupted at the highest lead dose. These data suggest that the reproductive axis is particularly sensitive to lead during specific developmental periods, resulting in delayed sexual maturation produced by suppression by sex steroid biosynthesis. The mechanisms underlying this appear to involve lead actions on both LH release and gonadal function. At low, environmentally relevant blood lead concentrations, adaptation to the continuous presence of the metal ion occurs and surprisingly little effect is observed on adult reproductive endocrinology and physiology.

TI  - Sex differences in exercise motivation and body-image satisfaction among college students.  
AB  - The current study was an expansion of one by Cash, Novy, and Grant in 1994, in which responses of 101 female nursing students were examined for associations between reasons for exercise, frequency of exercise, and body-image satisfaction. In the current study, 78 male and 100 female undergraduates between the ages of 18 and 25 years (M = 21.2, SD = 1.9) from various majors completed a demographics/frequency of exercise survey, two body-assessment inventories, and the Reasons for Exercise Inventory of Silberstein, Striegel-Moore, Timko, and Rodin. Contrary to Cash, et al.'s findings, only health and fitness reasons were predictive of women's frequency of exercise, and women's dissatisfaction with specific bodily attributes was not significantly related to any reasons for exercising; however, like women in their sample, the current students who experienced more situational body dissatisfaction exercised for appearance and weight control.  Sex comparisons indicated similar dissatisfaction with specific bodily attributes among men and women, but values were not significantly associated with any reasons for exercising. Women reported higher situational body dissatisfaction and exercising for appearance-related reasons more than men. Current participants may represent a more diverse group than previously tested, and the inventory's factor structure may not be generalizable to men and women.

TI  - Emergency admissions of older people to hospital: a link with material deprivation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to investigate whether variations in emergency admission to hospital amongst older people in Leicestershire vary with the level of material deprivation of the area in which they live. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Trent Patient Information System for patients aged 65 and over, admitted as an emergency medical admission to Leicestershire's acute and community hospitals on at least one occasion during the period October 1993-September 1994. The 1991 Census was used to examine the nature of the areas from which these emergency admissions were drawn and variations in emergency admission rates across Leicestershire. The relationship between emergency medical admissions and age, sex and material deprivation as measured by the Townsend deprivation score was examined. RESULTS: There were 13,305 people aged 65 or over with at least one emergency medical admission out of an estimated population (65 and over) in 1994 of 134,608 (9.9 per cent). Unconditional logistic regression showed that the risk of emergency admission increased with age and was also higher for men than for women. Emergency admissions increased significantly with increasing deprivation for each age group. This was most notable in the 65-74 years age group, yielding an odds ratio of 2.06 [95 per cent confidence interval (1.86, 2.29)], when comparing those from the most deprived areas with those from the least deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of emergency medical admission to hospital, which is associated with residence in areas characterized as deprived by Census-based indicators, suggests there are enduring inequalities in health or health care amongst older people. Inequalities noted for all ages persist into old age, although in the 'oldest' age groups, the effect is weaker. Material deprivation may also be a proxy for other factors, such as differences in social support and the type of care received.

TI  - Objective assessment of smoking habits by urinary cotinine measurement in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. Reliability of reported cigarette consumption and relationship to urinary albumin excretion.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of objective smoking status to age, sex, longterm metabolic control, and urinary albumin excretion. Patients with type 1 diabetes who smoke are at increased risk to develop diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. While this has repeatedly been demonstrated in adults, smoking habits have rarely been investigated in adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Urinary continine excretion has been determined by radioimmunoassay in 238 adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. This biochemical parameter of nicotine use was related to age, to the number of cigarettes allegedly consumed per day, and to urinary albumin excretion. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (19.3%) with urinary cotinine values > 500 ng/ml were classified as smokers. In 26 patients (10.9%), cotinine values between 100 and 500 ng/ml were found (infrequent smokers or environmental nicotine exposure), while the remaining 166 patients excreted < 100 ng/ml of cotinine in the urine (nonsmokers). Smokers were significantly older (20.2 +/- 0.6 years [mean +/- SE]) compared with the intermediate group (18.3 +/- 0.7 years) or with nonsmokers (15.9 +/- 0.4 years; P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Of 46 smokers, 12 denied smoking cigarettes entirely, and among biochemically defined smokers, no correlation was present between urinary continine excretion and the reported number of cigarettes consumed per day. Urinary albumin excretion was significantly higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers (P < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that cigarette smoking is common among German adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes in this study. Many patients deny nicotine use or refuse to disclose their smoking habits. Increased urinary albumin excretion is consistent with an increased risk of nephropathy in subjects with diabetes who smoke. Pediatricians in charge of adolescents with type 1 diabetes should actively discuss the risk of nicotine consumption with their patients.

TI  - [Subarachnoid hemorrhage in 'Vital Statistics of Japan', 1993-1995: variability with age and sex]  
AB  - The incidence and death rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) varies with age and sex. Female preponderance in the incidence of SAH is a well-known fact. However, the degree varies with age. Autopsy data, records of natural history of unruptured aneurysms, epidemiological and clinical cooperative studies have provided a great amount of information regarding the statistics of subarachnoid hemorrhage. But, each individual study has its own limitation, such as a bias in case selection in autopsy or clinical studies, predominance of aged population in the epidemiological cohort studies, limited frequency in the detection of unruptured aneurysms in the entire population. These shortcomings are reflected in the variability in the statistical data of these studies. Death records in 'Vital Statistics of Japan', published annually by Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, exhibit the numbers of deaths by cause (according to ICD-9 or 10 code), sex and age. In this study, we calculated the death rates of SAH (per 100,000) in 1993-1995 for each age group of both sexes based on the published data. Deaths from breast cancers and automobile accidents (AMA) were assessed in the same manner and compared with the results of SAH. The annual death rate of SAH for all people in Japan is 10.7 per 100,000 population and the average age of death is 65.6 y.o. The death rate is 8.2 for men, and 13.1 for women. Average age at the death is 60.2 y.o. in men, and 68.8 y.o. in women (p < 0.001). The age-adjusted death rate to 1985 Japanese population was 7.3 for men and 9.2 for women. Below age 60, rate of death caused by SAH is higher for men than women, but the ratio reverses in the population over 60. For men, the death rates after the age of 40, 50, 60 and 70 were 16.4, 20.4, 24.1 and 29.2 respectively. For women, the rates were 25.0, 32.8, 44.1 and 62.4. The female-to-male ratio of the death rates increases with age. Female sex should be considered as a risk factor for death from SAH. Number of deaths from breast cancers was about 90% of those from SAH in women. There was a difference in the age distribution; deaths caused by breast cancer tend to occur in younger age than those caused by SAHs. Mean age of death was 59.3 for breast cancer and 68.8 for SAH. Deaths caused by SAH is 1.4 times more likely to occur than those by breast cancer for a 50 year-old woman for the rest of her life, 1.9 times for a 60 y.o. woman, and 2.7 times for a 70 y.o. woman. Regular examination to detect breast cancer is widely performed in Japan among elderly women. We believe that a similar screening effort should be targeted for unruptured aneurysms from the standpoint of the medico-social cost. Automobile accidents (AMA) victimize as many people as SAH in Japan, about 13,000 per year. For males over the age of forty, AMA victims are more than those from SAH. However, conversely females' deaths from SAH occur three times frequently as those from AMAs. The fact should be taken into consideration when screening for unruptured aneurysms.

TI  - Risk factors for Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) seropositivity in a cohort of homosexual men, 1981-1996.  
AB  - A newly identified herpesvirus has been associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. We determined risk factors for Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) seropositivity and incidence of infection over time in a cohort of Danish homosexual men followed from 1981 to 1996. Antibodies to a latent nuclear (LANA) and a structural (orf65) antigen of KSHV/HHV-8 were measured by immunofluorescence and ELISA/WB respectively. Through linkage with the national AIDS registry, all cohort members diagnosed with AIDS as of September 1996 were identified and their hospital records were scrutinized to record all diagnoses of KS. Overall, 21.1% (52/246) of the men were KSHV/HHV-8-seropositive in 1981. Among the initially seronegative, the rate of KSHV/HHV-8 seroconversion was highest between 1981 and 1982 and declined steadily thereafter. In a multivariate analysis of the status at enrollment in 1981, KSHV/HHV-8 seropositivity was not associated with age but was independently associated both with number of receptive anal intercourses (OR = 2.83; p = 0.03) and with sex with US men (OR = 2.27; p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis of follow-up data, risk of KSHV/HHV-8 seroconversion was independently associated with having visited homosexual communities in the United States, and current HIV-positive status. More than 5 years' homosexual experience was associated with an insignificantly increased risk (RR = 2.68). KS occurred only in HIV-positive men who were KSHV/HHV-8-positive at or prior to their KS diagnosis. In conclusion, KSHV/HHV-8 appears to be sexually transmitted, probably by receptive anal intercourse, and may have been introduced to Danish homosexual men via sex with US men. The epidemic of KSHV/HHV-8 is now declining. These findings are concordant with the view that KSHV/HHV-8 may have been actively spread simultaneously with and by the same activities that lead to the spread of HIV.

TI  - Changing pattern of delays in reporting AIDS diagnoses in Australia.  
AB  - To accurately monitor and predict the progress of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is important to adjust reported AIDS counts for reporting delays. This requires estimation of the reporting delay distribution. This paper aims to use a statistical model to identify the main factors influencing reporting delays in Australia and to adjust reported incidence data for these delays among cases of AIDS diagnosed from 1993 and reported before 30 June 1997. Reporting delays were found to vary significantly across states/territories. The influence of calendar time of diagnosis was also significant, with an overall trend toward longer delays over time. AIDS cases diagnosed in the fourth quarter of a year were reported significantly more quickly than those diagnosed in the first or third quarters. No significant differences were found due to sex, age and HIV exposure category, except people with haemophilia, in whom AIDS cases appeared to be reported more slowly. After adjusting for under-reporting and reporting delay, we found that the AIDS incidence in Australia was declining from about 1000 cases per year in 1994 to about 760 cases per year in 1996.

Young men exceeded women in physical release as primary motive for sex, but women exceeded men in this choice at an older age. We conducted a modified replication, and we also studied Rubin's Love Scale, sexual interest, frequency of sexual arousal, and sexual enjoyment. Analysis did not confirm the earlier findings. For 60 men and 60 women differences were found for sexual interest, frequency of sexual arousal, and sexual enjoyment, with men scoring higher. Scores on Rubin's Love Scale did not differentiate the sexes.

TI  - Physiological and emotional response to psychological stressors in psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders.  
AB  - Deviations from emotional and physiological homeostasis in humans occur under episodic, chronic, or traumatic stress experiences. These dysregulations can provoke emotional and physical disturbances that may result in stress-related psychiatric or psychosomatic disorders. This brief review discusses a variety of both naturally occurring and experimental stressors and the complexity of intervening variables on cardiovascular and hormonal dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition to the type, intensity, and duration of the stressor, subject variables such as dispositional factors (e.g., age and sex), personality traits, and coping styles are considered. Finally, emotional and physiological stress responses to naturally occurring stressors and psychological challenge tests in depressed patients and anxiety disorder patients are presented and discussed. Stressors in humans induce emotional arousal, which leads to physiological activation of the central nervous system, an increase of hormones of the HPA axis, and coping reactions on the psychological and behavioral level. Depending on the type, intensity, and duration of the stressor, on personal and psychosocial resources of the individual, stressful situations may provoke emotional and physical disturbances. These dysfunctions may result in psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders. The following brief review intends to discuss a variety of stressors that have been examined in humans in order to gain insight into the complex relationship between physiological and behavioral stress reactions and the occurrence or maintenance of stress related psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to give hospitalized women with a diagnosis of mental illness the opportunity to describe their experiences in mixed sex wards. A qualitative study, using focus groups, was conducted. The three major themes that emerged from the study were: (i) environment; (ii) gender; and (iii) vulnerability. The study incorporated a feminist and phenomenological perspective. In essence, the study found that although some women had experienced problems with safety, they indicated they would prefer mixed sex to single sex wards.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency by using a single nucleated erythrocyte from maternal blood.  
AB  - We have developed a method that allows the prenatal DNA diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency by using a single fetal nucleated erythrocyte (NRBC) isolated from maternal blood. OTC gene analysis of a male patient (TF) with early onset OTC deficiency was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing. To investigate the possible prenatal diagnosis of OTC deficiency, maternal blood was obtained at 13 weeks of gestation of a subsequent pregnancy, from the mother of patient TF. NRBCs in the maternal blood were separated by using the density gradient method and then collected with a micromanipulator. The entire genome of a single NRBC was amplified by primer extension preamplification (PEP). The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ alpha genotype and sex were determined from small aliquots of the PEP product. The HLA-DQ alpha genotype of each of the parents of the male patient was also determined. Once a single NRBC had been identified as being of fetal origin, the OTC gene was analyzed by using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. DNA analysis revealed a point mutation in exon 9 of the OTC gene in the OTC-deficient patient (TF). All NRBCs retrieved from maternal blood were successfully identified as being of fetal origin by HLA-DQ alpha genotyping and sex determination. RFLP analysis demonstrated that the fetal OTC gene was normal. This is the first study to successfully diagnose OTC deficiency prenatally, by using a single fetal NRBC from the maternal circulation. Such prenatal DNA diagnosis is non-invasive and can be applied to other genetic diseases, including autosomal and X-linked diseases.

TI  - Post-ERCP pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia: the role of operative and patient factors [published erratum appears in Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 1998 Aug;10(8):731]  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia are common complications of ERCP and this study was designed to explain which operative and patient factors predispose to them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 1 year prospective study of consecutive patients in a single operator centre with detailed attention to technical factors and the findings. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty ERCPs were performed. Pancreatitis occurred in 12 cases (2.8%). Amylase results were available in 407 cases; 17 were excluded because of pre-operative hyperamylasaemia (n = 5) and because of pancreatitis (n = 12). Of the remaining 390, 30 (7.7%) had hyperamylasaemia. Pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia usually occurred after difficult procedures in which pancreatography was achieved. Smaller common bile-ducts, pre-cut papillotomy and some preoperative indications also significantly increased the risk of pancreatitis, while prior papillotomy was protective. Pancreatitis occurred in patients with a younger median age (52.5 vs 68.0; P < 0.05) and was more common in women (F:M = 11:1 vs 241:177; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Operative factors are, in part, responsible for the development of pancreatitis and hyperamylasaemia but the age and sex of the patient also appear to be important.

TI  - Ten-year blood pressure trends in nonhypertensive inhabitants of La Plata, Argentina.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare, according to blood pressure (BP) categories, 10-year trends in BP measurements in nonhypertensive subjects and the relative risk of developing hypertension. DESIGN: Population study. BP was recorded as the average of two measures taken on a single occasion with a mercury sphygmomanometer and the auscultation method. SETTING: Residents of La Plata, aged 15 to 64 years. PARTICIPANTS: The study was based on randomly chosen individuals who, during a previous survey in 1985, were 15 to 64 years old and whose BP was below 140/90 mmHg. They were grouped according to sex and BP categories. Random age- and sex-stratified sampling of 151 men and 193 women was performed. Categories were high normal BP, optimal BP (as defined by the fifth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) and normal but not optimal BP defined as BP 120 to 129/80 to 84 mmHg. RESULTS: BP increased in all categories; this increase was significant (P < 0.01) except for diastolic BP in women with high normal BP. BP increases were higher in optimal BP subjects and lower in high normal BP subjects (P < 0.01 for women and not significant for men). The relative risk of developing hypertension in high normal BP subjects was triple that in optimal BP subjects (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in BP observed in optimal BP subjects stress the importance of monitoring BP changes and recommending primary prevention in the whole population.

TI  - [Survival of lung transplant at the Puerta de Hierro Clinic]  
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze patient survival after lung transplants performed at the Puerta de Hierro clinic in Madrid (Spain) between 1991 and 1996. Survival probability was 65% after one year and 50% after three years. We found no significant differences in survival related to sex or type of transplant. Early survival tended to be higher for the last two years analyzed (71%) than for the first two (55%) (p < 0.00001). The rate was 100% for patients with cystic fibrosis and 0% for pulmonary hypertension and lymphangiomyomatosis. Short- and medium-term lung function results were good in surviving patients who did not develop obliterating bronchiolitis. We conclude that actuarial survival after lung transplant in our program is comparable to that reported in the literature. There are no significant differences related to sex, type of transplant or period. Survival varies greatly, however, depending on disease.

TI  - Effect of surgical panel composition on patient outcome at a level I trauma center.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of staffing with general surgeons vs trauma specialists on patient outcome at a trauma center. DESIGN: The care of injured patients at a level I urban trauma center serving a population of 2.5 million was the responsibility of 12 surgeons (10 general surgeons and 2 trauma specialists) between January 1 and June 30, 1996 (group 1). Between July 1 and December 31, 1996 (group 2), trauma was the responsibility solely of 4 trauma specialists. An additional comparison was made with those patients in group 1 who were admitted to the general surgeons (group 1A). The outcomes and quality of care for these periods, as determined by the quality assurance screens, were retrospectively analyzed and compared. SETTING: Urban, tertiary care, level I trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: Each trauma and burn patient admitted during the study periods is included in this study. Upon the patient's discharge from the hospital, specially trained nurses completed a review of the patient's stay and entered it into the TraumaOne database (Lancet Technology Inc, Cambridge, Mass). There were 693 trauma patients in group 1 (472 in group 1A) and 734 patients in group 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, length of stay, and 16 quality assurance screens were quantified and compared using chi(2) analyses and t tests. RESULTS: The age and sex of the 2 groups were similar. The mortality rate was 6.2% (43/693) in group 1, 6.1% (29/472) in group 1A, and 6.5% (48/734) in group 2 (P = .80 and P = .78, respectively). When stratified by injury severity score (ISS), lengths of stay were statistically similar, except for patients with an ISS of 0 to 7. Patients with an ISS of 0 to 7 in groups 1 and 1A stayed a mean of 2.6 days, compared with 3.2 days for group 2 (P = .01 and P = .02, respectively). The results of quality assurance screens (missed injury, wound infection, readmission, and 13 others) were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Transitions in staffing afforded the opportunity to examine patient outcomes by surgeon specialization and frequency of call. In our sample, 12 well-trained surgeons taking call less frequently managed a trauma service as efficiently as a group of 4 trauma specialists, without any differences in morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Survey of cadaveric donor application files: 1978-1993.  
AB  - Information derived from application files of potential cadaveric donors to our body donation program from the period of 1978-1993 was entered into a customized database to assess the characteristics of people contributing to such a program. A total of 1,267 application files were reviewed and the following information analyzed: 1) year of application submission, 2) age, 3) sex, 4) race, 5) marital status, 6) education, 7) occupation, and 8) disposition of cremains (return or not to family). Overall the typical body donor applicant to our program was likely to be a white married female homemaker of about 70 years of age. She was a high school graduate and chose not to have her cremains returned to her family. The males closely follow the above mentioned characteristics (with the exception of occupation), but were outnumbered by females in nearly every category throughout the span of our analysis. An analysis of the application numbers over the 15 year period of our survey indicated a reduction in applications during the period of 1982-1984 and a linear increase of applicant numbers from 1989 to 1993. Finally, we observed a tendency for married couples to donate together with 32.1% of our married applicants showing this phenomenon.

TI  - Trends in injury mortality among adolescents in Taiwan, 1965-94.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe trends in injury mortality among adolescents in Taiwan for prioritising preventive interventions. METHODS: Adolescent injury mortality data for Taiwan were derived from official publications of vital statistics from 1965 to 1994 to determine trends by sex and cause of death. Simple linear regression was used to test the trends. RESULTS: The number of deaths due to injury among adolescents aged 10-19 years in Taiwan increased from 983 in 1965 to 1783 in 1994, an 81% increase. The injury mortality rate increased 42%, from 32.2 per 100,000 in 1965 to 45.6 per 100,000 in 1994. The proportion of injury deaths also increased, from 45.3% in 1965 to 72.8% in 1994. The trends in mortality from motor vehicle injury (MVI) among four demographic groups were all significantly positive (p < 0.001). The proportion of deaths due to MVI among injury was 14% in 1965 and increased to 63% in 1994. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in injury mortality rates among adolescents over the past three decades appears to be due largely to the increase in MVI mortality rates with males aged 15-19 years accounting for most of this increase. Priorities for adolescents in Taiwan are MVI (especially motorcyclists) and drownings.

TI  - Does additional lubrication affect condom slippage and breakage?  
AB  - The risk of condom slippage (1.94%) and breakage (0.89%) among 3607 condoms was analysed with respect to the use of additional lubricant. Whether or not lubricant was used, the site at which it was applied and the type of lubricant used were all found to vary significantly with the type of sexual act(s) for which the condoms were used. Little evidence was found for differing effects of type of additional lubricant (water-based, saliva or other) or site of lubricant use (on penis/inside condom, on condom, in vagina/anus). The use of lubricant more than doubles the risk of slippage for vaginal sex. While anal sex is associated with much higher risks of slippage the use of lubricant for this practice actually reduces the risk of slippage to that similar for vaginal sex where lubricant is used. No significant effect of additional lubricant on condom breakage was observed. It is recommended that education messages concerning the use of additional lubricant may need to change to take into account the varied nature of lubricant use practices and the differential effects of lubricant with respect to sexual practices. Specifically, if the use of additional lubricant has little or no impact on condom breakage but increases condom slippage then encouraging its use may be counterproductive if condom users consider slippage to be a reason not to use condoms.

TI  - [Fronto-orbital corrections and development of the frontal sinus]  
AB  - The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature. In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically. Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included. The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected din postero-anterior cephalograms. According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients. There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement. With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.

TI  - Brainstem involvement in obsessive-compulsive disorder.  
AB  - We investigated the possible involvement of the brainstem in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were collected from a population of neurotics (100 patients), including a group of 50 subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and the rest having generalized anxiety disorder. Twenty-five, age- and sex-matched, healthy volunteers served as controls. BAEPs were recorded by standard techniques as recommended by the AEEGS Clinical Evoked Potentials Guidelines. A one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher least-significant difference test were used for statistical analysis of the data. After stimulation of the right ear, a significant increase of wave I-V interpeak latency was found in the two groups of patients as compared with that of controls. Moreover OCD patients had a significantly reduced amplitude of wave III when compared to that of the control group. Our electrophysiological data suggest a possible involvement of brainstem in OCD pathogenesis. We discuss our findings in relation to biochemical, anatomical and physiological alterations described in the literature for serotonin-dependent systems.

TI  - Mortality in adults with and without diabetes in a national cohort of the U.S. population, 1971-1993.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine 22-year mortality (1971-1993), causes of death, life expectancy, and survival in a national sample of diabetic and nondiabetic adults according to age, sex, and race. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A representative national cohort of 14,374 adults aged 25-74 years was identified in 1971-1975 in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I). Diabetes was ascertained by medical history interview. The cohort was followed for mortality through 1992-1993, with verification of vital status for 96.2% (n = 13,830). Causes of death were determined from death certificates. RESULTS: Diabetic subjects comprised 5.1% of the cohort and accounted for 10.6% of the deaths. Mortality for diabetic subjects increased from 12.4 per 1,000 person-years for those aged 25-44 years at baseline to 89.7 per 1,000 person-years for those aged 65-74 years. The age-adjusted mortality rate was 57% higher for diabetic men than for diabetic women; the rate was 27% higher for diabetic non-Hispanic blacks than for diabetic non-Hispanic whites. Mortality rates were highest for insulin-treated subjects and for those with > or = 15 years' duration of diabetes. Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying cause of death for only 7.7% of diabetic men and 13.4% of diabetic women. Considering multiple causes of death, heart disease was listed the most frequently and was present on 69.5% of death certificates of people with diabetes. Death rates were higher for diabetic than for nondiabetic subjects in all age, sex, and race groups. The relative risk of death (diabetic versus nondiabetic subjects) declined with age from a value of 3.6 for those aged 25-44 years at baseline to 1.5 for those aged 65-74 years. The relative risk was elevated in diabetic subjects for all major causes of death except malignant neoplasms. Survival of diabetic subjects was lower than that of nondiabetic subjects in all age, sex, and race groups. Median life expectancy was 8 years lower for diabetic adults aged 55-64 years and 4 years lower for those aged 65-74 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this representative national sample of adults, mortality rates were higher for diabetic men than for diabetic women and for diabetic blacks than for diabetic whites. The study confirms the substantially higher risk of death, lower survival, and lower life expectancy of diabetic adults compared with nondiabetic adults.

TI  - Cancer among a Michigan cohort exposed to polybrominated biphenyls in 1973 [see comments]  
AB  - The long-term health effects of human exposure to polybrominated biphenyls are not known. In this nested case-control study, we evaluated the association between site-specific cancer risk and serum polybrominated biphenyl levels among a Michigan cohort accidentally exposed to polybrominated biphenyls in 1973. The Michigan Department of Public Health has followed 3,899 people through 1993, among whom 195 primary cancers were identified in 187 persons. Controls were 696 randomly selected cancer-free individuals who were frequency matched to cases by sex and age (in 5-year strata). Baseline serum polybrominated biphenyl levels were measured using standard methods. We found an increasing dose-response relation for digestive system cancer risk with higher serum polybrominated biphenyl category [4-20 parts per billion (ppb), 21-50 ppb, and > 50 ppb] after adjustment for age, family cancer history, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and baseline serum polychlorinated biphenyl level. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for each category were 8.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-53.3], 12.3 (95% CI = 0.80-191), and 22.9 (95% CI = 1.34-392), respectively. Univariate analysis for polybrominated biphenyl level and lymphoma risk also showed a dose-response relation, with corresponding ORs of 3.24 (95% CI = 0.24-95.9), 20.5 (95% CI = 1.51-608), and 32.6 (95% CI = 3.33-861).

TI  - Otitis media with effusion and size at birth.  
AB  - To investigate whether recurrent or persistent otitis media with effusion (OME) was associated with particular patterns of fetal growth, we conducted a case control study of 129 children admitted for insertion of grommets and 150 controls. The risk of OME was not statistically significantly related to gestational age or individual measures of size at birth, but the ratio of head circumference to total length and the ponderal index at birth were statistically significantly lower in children with OME, both before and after adjustment for the potentially confounding effects of sex, age at current operation, and maternal gravidity. Mothers of cases were 2.2 times more likely than those of controls to have had one or more previous pregnancies that had not ended in a live birth (95% CI 1.3-3.8). We conclude that fetal growth, reflected by proportions at birth, may affect later risk of recurrent and persistent OME.

TI  - Clinical applications of the Adelaide Activities Profile.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP) was developed from the Frenchay Activities Index, and has been shown to be a valid measure of the lifestyle activities of elderly people. The goals of the current study were to illustrate the value of applying the AAP in the clinical setting, and to demonstrate the relationship of the AAP to the use of formal services. DESIGN: Data were collected as part of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA). A community sample, stratified by age and sex, was chosen to be representative of the elderly population of Adelaide, South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 1799 community-dwelling people aged 70 years and over. MEASURES: Lifestyle activities were assessed with the AAP, which provides measures of activity on four scales: domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others, and social activities. Participants were defined as users of formal services if they were active clients of any of the Domiciliary Care and Rehabilitation Services, Meals-on-Wheels, or the Royal District Nursing Society. RESULTS: Age and sex norms for the AAP were provided, and the clinical value of using these norms was illustrated by two contrasting case studies. Users of formal services had lower activity levels than nonusers for all AAP scales, particularly household maintenance and domestic chores. CONCLUSIONS: The AAP is a valuable addition to the standard battery of instruments used in the assessment of elderly people, and has clinical application as both a health outcome measure and an indicator of the need for intervention.

TI  - Specialists achieve better outcomes than generalists for lung cancer surgery [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A push toward care provided by generalists as opposed to specialists has occurred in the health-care marketplace despite a lack of provider specific outcome data. The objective of this study was to determine whether the outcome of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery is different between general surgeons (GSs) and thoracic surgeons (TSs). DESIGN: Examination of data from a state-wide severity-adjusted administrative hospital discharge database. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing lung cancer resection in all nonfederal acute care hospitals within South Carolina. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality by specialty adjusted for case mix. RESULTS: From 1991 to 1995, 1,720 resections for lung cancer were performed in South Carolina. One hundred thirty-seven cases were excluded because surgeons did not meet the predefined criteria for board certification, leaving 1,583 resections for analysis. One-half of lobectomies and nearly 60% of pneumonectomies were performed by GSs. Patients were similar in age, sex, gender, race, and the proportion in each severity of illness subclass. Mortality was significantly higher in patients who underwent lobectomy by GSs vs TSs (5.3% vs 3.0%; p<0.05) and in patients with extreme comorbidities (43.6% vs 25.4%; p=0.03) or age >65 years (7.4% vs 3.5%; p<0.05). Seventy percent of TSs performed > 10 cases in the series, whereas 75% of GSs performed <10 (p=0.05). Logistic regression analysis failed to identify any significant variable that might explain the mortality differences between TSs and GSs. CONCLUSION: Mortality is lower for lung cancer resection when the surgery is performed by a TS.

TI  - Pre-transplant recipient-donor interaction: a prognostic indicator in living related kidney transplantation?  
AB  - Based on the hypothesis that not only genetically determined immune characteristics, but also psychosocial and especially interpersonal factors may influence the outcome in living related kidney transplantation, we investigated the type of relationship between recipient and donor, and its association with graft prognosis. The study group consisted of 154 kidney transplant candidates and their selected donors. Donor and recipient were assessed prospectively prior to transplantation using an interactional task (Usandivaras Marbles Test) and assigned to one of four groups, according to their pattern of contact. Kidney survival was calculated for each test group, and results compared by life table methods and logistic regression. The group that showed progression from initial contact avoidance or enmeshment to contact with boundaries had a significantly better outcome than the other groups (no change or loss of contact with boundaries). Differences could not be related to other variables such as age, sex, sex difference, relationship, HLA-matching, and treatment.

TI  - Aspartame: neuropsychologic and neurophysiologic evaluation of acute and chronic effects.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurobehavioral symptoms have been reported anecdotally with aspartame. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether aspartame can disrupt cognitive, neurophysiologic, or behavioral functioning in normal individuals. DESIGN: Forty-eight healthy volunteers completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The first month was aspartame free. Subjects then consumed sodas and capsules with placebo, aspartame, or sucrose for 20 d each. Order was randomized and subjects were assigned to either a high- (45 mg x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1)) or low- (15 mg x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1)) dose aspartame group. Neuropsychologic and laboratory testing was done on day 10 of each treatment period to determine possible acute effects and on day 20 for possible chronic effects. RESULTS: Plasma phenylalanine concentrations increased significantly during aspartame treatment. Neuropsychologic results; adverse experiences; amino acid, insulin, and glucose values; and electroencephalograms were compared by sex and by treatment. No significant differences were found for any dependent measure. CONCLUSION: Large daily doses of aspartame had no effect on neuropsychologic, neurophysiologic, or behavioral functioning in healthy young adults.

TI  - Alternative splicing of the D2 dopamine receptor messenger ribonucleic acid is modulated by activated sex steroid receptors in the MMQ prolactin cell line.  
AB  - The two isoforms of the D2 dopamine receptor are generated by alternative splicing of the exon 6 of the premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA), changing the length of the third cytoplasmic loop involved in the coupling to G proteins. In the MMQ PRL cell line, sex steroid hormones modulated the proportion of the two D2 receptor isoforms. Under controlled culture conditions, 17beta-estradiol (E2) strongly favored the production of the long isoform of D2 mRNA over the short one, whereas both isoforms were equally abundant when culture medium was hormone depleted. In the presence of progesterone (P), E2 action was inhibited, and equal amounts of each D2 receptor isoform were produced in the cells. Hormone treatments never modified either the total amount of D2 receptor mRNA and D2 receptor binding sites or D2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Specific antagonists demonstrated that the activity of each hormone depended on their nuclear receptors. Inhibitors of gene transcription or translation also showed that their activity required protein synthesis. The expression of the short D2 receptor isoform was never prominent, even at the single cell level. Analysis of the intron sequence flanking alternative exon 6 showed that only the upstream intron presented two sequence tracts known to be targets for splicing factors. Taken together, these results provide converging evidence for a physiologically relevant mechanism by which sex steroid receptors could regulate the expression of a splicing factor favoring the production of the long dopamine D2 receptor isoform.

TI  - Hypertrophic remodeling: gender differences in the early response to left ventricular pressure overload.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify gender differences in left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy, and function in response to pressure overload due to ascending aortic banding in rats. BACKGROUND: Gender may influence the adaptation to pressure overload, as women with aortic stenosis have greater degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy and better left ventricular function than men. METHODS: Fifty-two weanling rats underwent ascending aortic banding (16 males, 18 females), or sham surgery (9 males, 9 females). At 6 and 20 weeks, rats underwent transthoracic echo Doppler studies, and closed-chest left ventricular pressures with direct left ventricular puncture. Perfusion-fixed tissues from eight rats were examined morphometrically for myocyte cross-sectional area and percent collagen volume. RESULTS: At 6 weeks after aortic banding, left ventricular remodeling, extent of hypertrophy, and function appeared similar in male and female rats. At 20 weeks, male but not female rats showed an early transition to heart failure, with onset of cavity dilatation (left ventricular diameter=155% vs. 121% of same-sex sham), loss of concentric remodeling (relative wall thickness=102% vs. 139% of sham), elevated wall stress (systolic stress=266% vs. 154% of sham), and diastolic dysfunction (deceleration of rapid filling=251% vs. 190% of sham). Left ventricular systolic pressures were higher in female compared with male rats (186+/-20 vs. 139+/-13 mm Hg), while diastolic pressures tended to be lower (14+/-4 vs. 17+/-4 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: Gender significantly influences the evolution of the early response to pressure overload, including the transition to heart failure in rats with aortic stenosis.

AB  - In this essay, sexual acting out is subdivided into four forms in order to better define their separate meanings to the unfaithful spouse, the partner, and the therapist: affairs, just-sex, making-do sex, imaginary partner sex. The conventional justifications for considering any sexual acting out a form of psychopathology are presented. These justifications are more compelling in some forms of acting out than others. Love affairs, the major subject of this paper, can also be understood as an existential choice that arises within a large array of social and psychological situations. The conscious experience of the betrayed and betrayer is explored. Guidelines for the therapist's role in dealing with individuals and couples involved in these lifechanging experiences are offered.

TI  - Inv(10)(p11.2q21.2), a variant chromosome.  
AB  - We present 33 families in which a pericentric inversion of chromosome 10 is segregating. In addition, we summarise the data on 32 families in which an apparently identical inv(10) has been reported in the literature. Ascertainment was through prenatal diagnosis or with a normal phenotype in 21/33 families. In the other 12 families, probands were ascertained through a wide variety of referral reasons but in all but one case (a stillbirth), studies of the family showed that the reason for referral was unrelated to the chromosome abnormality. There has been, to our knowledge, no recorded instance of a recombinant chromosome 10 arising from this inversion and no excess of infertility or spontaneous abortion among carriers of either sex. We propose that inv(10)(p11.2q21.2) can be regarded as a variant analogous to the pericentric inversion of chromosome 2(p11q13). We conclude that prenatal chromosome analysis is not justified for inv(10) carriers. In addition, family investigation of carrier status is not warranted in view of the unnecessary concern this may cause parents and other family members.

TI  - Skin diseases in immigrants seen as out-patients in the Institute of Dermatology of the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' from 1989 to 1994.  
AB  - In the Institute of Dermatology of the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' (IDURLS) from 1989 to 1994, 2198 immigrants from countries outside the European Community were seen as out-patients. Their personal and pathological data were collected by a particular software 'Questio', set up together with colleagues of the Interdepartimental Center for Scientific Calculous (ICSC) of the University of Rome 'La Sapienza'. The number of patients has been increasing from 326 in 1989 to 436 in 1994. Most of the people were coming from Africa, but from 1989 to 1994 the number of patients from the regions of ex-Yugoslavia has been increasing. About one third of the immigrants were unemployed, whereas 40% of them had a job (worker or employee), and the remaining 20% was composed by students and housewives. Most immigrants (1474 patients) were 20-39-year-old. Their data were compared with those of a control group composed by 2100 Italian people of the same age and sex, seen as out-patients in IDURLS in the same period. The most frequent skin disorders observed in immigrants were skin infectious or parasitic diseases, above all scabies. Excluding people with scabies, both immigrants and Italian patients shared the same skin diseases typical of young adult people: many fungal infections, many contact dermatitis and very few skin malignant tumors.

TI  - Platelet serotonin transporter in depressed children and adolescents: 3H-paroxetine platelet binding before and after sertraline.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serotonin transporter protein (5HTPR) binding in platelets from children and adolescents with major depression (MDD) compared to normal controls using the selective ligand 3H-paroxetine. METHOD: Children and adolescents with MDD (n = 24) defined by DSM-III-R criteria and normal controls (n = 22) were compared by platelet 5HTPR kinetic analysis with the hypothesis that 5HTPR is reduced in MDD. A subset of MDD subjects (n = 18) continued to participate in a fixed-dose, open-label sertraline trial for 6 weeks followed by drug-free washout and repeated 5HTPR analysis. RESULTS: Sex, prepubertal status, and age had no effect on 5HTPR. Medication-free MDD subjects differed from controls in reduced binding capacity (Bmax) (p < .001). Sertraline therapy decreased binding affinity from baseline non-selectively (p < .05), and Bmax elevation from baseline was associated with nonresponse and suicide attempt history. CONCLUSION: Earlier literature in this population is replicated with regard to reduced platelet 5HTPR Bmax in MDD. Findings support a continuum of 5HTPR involvement in MDD across the developmental spectrum.

TI  - [Epidemiology of malignant neoplasms of the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity in the Bydgoszcz region]  
AB  - The authors performed epidemiological analysis of malignant neoplasms of the nose, paranasal sinuses, throat, tongue, larynx and salivary glands in Bydgoszcz area. All the patients were treated in the Otolaryngological Clinic of Medical Academy in Bydgoszcz. Patient's sex, age, profession, living and environmental conditions as well as histopathological diagnosis were taken into analysis. The data were referred to various regions of Bydgoszcz province, which were elucidated on the basis of microclimate conditions, industry, soil conditions, density of the forest area, and cultivated agriculture plants. Correlations between occurrence of oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract malignant neoplasms and living conditions as well as kind of profession in different parts of Bydgoszcz province were estimated.

The experimental groups were (1) AngII (9 micrograms/h subcutaneously) or aldosterone (0.75 microgram/h subcutaneously in uninephrectomized rats on a high-sodium diet) administered by implanted minipump to chronically increase or decrease circulating AngII, respectively, (2) unoperated, untreated age- and sex-matched control rats, and (3) age- and sex-matched uninephrectomized control rats on a high-sodium diet.

TI  - Fibrosis and myocardial ACE: possible substrate and independence from circulating angiotensin II.  
AB  - In order to determine the relation between myocardial fibrosis and (1) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) binding density, (2) receptor binding of ACE-related peptides, angiotensin II (AngII) and bradykinin (BK), and (3) the regulation of myocardial ACE by circulating Ang II, we used in vitro quantitative autoradiography to localize and assess ACE ([125I]351A), AngII receptor (125I[Sar1, IIe8]AngII), and BK receptor ([125I]Tyr8) binding densities in the rat myocardium. The experimental groups were (1) AngII (9 micrograms/h subcutaneously) or aldosterone (0.75 microgram/h subcutaneously in uninephrectomized rats on a high-sodium diet) administered by implanted minipump to chronically increase or decrease circulating AngII, respectively, (2) unoperated, untreated age- and sex-matched control rats, and (3) age- and sex-matched uninephrectomized control rats on a high-sodium diet. In the same heart studied at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of hormone treatment, serial sections were assessed for myocardial (hematoxylin and eosin) and fibrillar collagen (picrosirius red) morphology. The authors found that (1) marked ACE binding was coincident with sites of fibrous tissue that appeared in both ventricles as either a perivascular fibrosis of intramyocardial coronary arterioles or microscopic scarring in response to AngII or aldosterone infusion, (2) ACE binding was independent of circulating AngII, (3) BK, not AngII, receptor binding density was markedly increased at fibrous tissue sites, and (4) high-density ACE and BK receptor binding were anatomically coincident. Thus, in these experimental models, ACE is related to fibrous tissue formation where it may use BK, not angiotensin I, as a substrate, and its binding density is independent of circulating AngII.
