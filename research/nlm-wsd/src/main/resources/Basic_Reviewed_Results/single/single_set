TI  - Multiple fixed doses of "Seroquel" (quetiapine) in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia: a comparison with haloperidol and placebo. The Seroquel Trial 13 Study Group.  
AB  - Five fixed doses of the atypical antipsychotic "Seroquel" (quetiapine) were evaluated to delineate a dose-response relationship, as measured by changes from baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) summary scores, and to compare efficacy and tolerability opposite placebo and haloperidol. Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Patients who completed a single-blind, placebo washout phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, or 750 mg daily), haloperidol (12 mg daily), or placebo and evaluated weekly for 6 weeks. At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin concentrations. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is both superior to placebo and comparable to haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms at doses ranging from 150 to 750 mg/day and in reducing negative symptoms at a dose of 300 mg/day.

TI  - Opportunities for psychiatry from genetic findings [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The opportunities for psychiatry deriving from available or likely genetic advances are reviewed. METHOD: Clinical implications are considered in the context of both the misconceptions and benefits associated with relevant genetic findings. RESULTS: Misconceptions include that: heritability estimates have a 'true' fixed value; a high heritability means that environmental interventions will be ineffective; a high heritability within groups means that differences between groups will also be due to genes; genetic effects are determinative; 'genetic' means single abnormal genes; genes associated with disease must be bad and justify eugenic measures; gene therapy will be widely applicable; and genetic screening of the general population will be useful. The benefits include demonstrations that: both genes and environment have an ubiquitous influence; some prevailing diagnostic assumptions are mistaken; genes influence development; the effects of nature and nurture are not separate; and environmental effects tend to be person-specific. The potential value of molecular genetics lies in elucidation of causal processes as they apply to both brain systems and nature-nurture interplay; improving diagnosis and genetic counselling; and the development of improved pharmacological interventions. CONCLUSION: Advances in genetics will make a major impact on clinical psychiatry, and should bring practical benefits for both prevention and treatment.

TI  - Functional expression of odorant receptors of the zebrafish Danio rerio and of the nematode C. elegans in HEK293 cells.  
AB  - Odorant receptors of zebrafish and C elegans were functionally expressed in vertebrate kidney cells (HEK293) using the eucaryotic expression vector pSMyc. Receptor-encoding cDNA cloned into this vector was expressed as a fusion protein with the N-terminal membrane import sequence of the guinea-pig serotonin receptor followed by a myc tag. Immunocytochemical evidence indicates that this strategy directs a protein with the predicted immunoreactivity and approximate molecular weight to the plasma membrane. Fish food extract (TetraMin) evoked a transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+] in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing cDNA for three fish odorant receptors and converted to stable cell lines. The effect of the extract was concentration dependent and limited to the fraction of the extract < 5 kDa. Pretreating the transfected cells with the PLC inhibitor U73122 reduced the odor-evoked signal. Fish food extract also evoked a transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+] in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing cDNA for single fish odorant receptors. Diacetyl evoked a transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+] in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the cDNA of ODR10, an odorant receptor of C. elegans suggested in other work to be specific for diacetyl. These results strongly imply that odorant receptors can be functionally expressed in HEK293 cells using this novel expression protocol.

TI  - A Morse-code recognition system with LMS and matching algorithms for persons with disabilities.  
AB  - Single-switch communication is an effective auxiliary method for persons with disabilities. However, it is not easy to recognize the Morse codes typed by them. In our earlier proposed Morse code auto-recognition method, using the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm, it was demonstrated that the system could successfully recognize the Morse-coded messages at unstable typing speeds. However, the speed variation had to be limited to a range between 0.67 and two times the present speed. In the case of beginners or those with heavy disabilities, this rule can not always be complied with, producing a low recognition rate of 20%. To address this limitation, this paper offers an advanced recognition method which combines the Least-Mean-Square algorithm with a character-by-character matching technique. The recognition rate for this method from simulated and real data from various sources is as high as 75% or more on average. This practical application of the single-switch method means a step forward toward alternative communication for disabled persons.

TI  - Clinical value of triple-energy window scatter correction in simultaneous dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography with 123I-BMIPP and 201Tl.  
AB  - To improve the image quality in simultaneous dual-isotope single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with iodine-123 labelled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and thallium-201, we applied the triple-energy window method (TEW) for correction of the cross-talk and scatter artifact. Seventy-one patients with coronary artery disease were included. 201Tl cross-talk into the 123I acquisition window (group 1, n = 30) and 123I cross-talk into the 201Tl window (group 2, n = 41) were studied. In group 1, 123I images were first obtained (single-isotope images), followed by 201Tl injection and SPET acquisition using dual-isotope windows (dual-isotope images). In group 2, the order was reversed. The dual-isotope SPET images with and without TEW were compared with the single-isotope images. Qualitative evaluation was performed by scoring the segmental defect pattern. Detectability of the mismatched fatty acid metabolism on dual-isotope SPET was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Segmental defect pattern agreement between dual and corrected single images was significantly improved by TEW correction (P<0.01). The agreement was particularly improved in segments with absence of uptake. There was no significant difference between TEW-corrected dual-isotope SPET and corresponding single-isotope SPET with regard to either % defect count or background activity. Mismatched fatty acid metabolism depicted by dual-isotope SPET predicted abnormal wall motion more accurately with TEW than without TEW. With TEW, a practical method for scatter and cross-talk correction in clinical settings, simultaneous dual 123I-BMIPP/201Tl SPET is feasible for the assessment of myocardial perfusion/metabolism mismatch.

TI  - Effective size and F-statistics of subdivided populations. II. Dioecious species.  
AB  - For a dioecious diploid population subdivided into an arbitrary number of subpopulations, we have derived recurrence equations for the inbreeding coefficient and coancestries between individuals within and among subpopulations and formulas for effective size and F-statistics. Stable population size and structure, discrete generations, autosomal inheritance, and the island migration model are assumed, and arbitrary distributions of the numbers of male and female progeny per family, different numbers and variable migration rates of males and females are incorporated in our derivation. Some published equations for effective size and F-statistics for a subdivided population are shown to be incorrect because several incorrect probabilities are used in the derivation. A more general equation for effective size is obtained by finding eigenvalue solutions to the recurrence equations for inbreeding coefficient and coancestry in this article, which reduces to the simple and familiar expressions derived by previous authors for the special case of a single unsubdivided population. Our general expressions for F-statistics also reduce to the classical results of WRIGHT's infinite island model and its extensions. It is shown that population structure is important in determining effective size and F-statistics and should be recognized and incorporated into programs for genetic conservation and evolution.

TI  - Reconstruction of massive defects in the head and neck: the role of simultaneous distant and regional flaps.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive defects resulting from excision of advanced head and neck tumors may not be amenable to reconstruction using a single technique of tissue transfer. Sixteen patients undergoing reconstruction using simultaneous free flaps and pedicled regional flaps are presented. METHODS: Regional flaps included the pectoralis major, deltopectoral, cervical visor, paramedian forehead, cervicofacial, and nape of neck flaps. Microvascular tissue transfers included the radial forearm, iliac crest, parascapular/latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominis, fibula, and lateral thigh free flaps. RESULTS: Most defects involved both aerodigestive mucosa and external cutaneous skin. Mucosal reconstruction was carried out using the soft-tissue component of the free flaps, whereas vascularized bone was used for mandibular reconstruction. Regional flaps were used to reconstruct skin of the face and neck. CONCLUSIONS: When planned and applied in a stepwise fashion, simultaneous free flaps and regional flaps are complimentary for the reconstruction of complex wounds in the head and neck.

TI  - A human intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel.  
AB  - An intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, hIK1, was cloned from human pancreas. The predicted amino acid sequence is related to, but distinct from, the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subfamily, which is approximately 50% conserved. hIK1 mRNA was detected in peripheral tissues but not in brain. Expression of hIK1 in Xenopus oocytes gave rise to inwardly rectifying potassium currents, which were activated by submicromolar concentrations of intracellular calcium (K0.5 = 0.3 microM). Although the K0.5 for calcium was similar to that of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, the slope factor derived from the Hill equation was significantly reduced (1.7 vs. 3. 5).  Single-channel current amplitudes reflected the macroscopic inward rectification and revealed a conductance level of 39 pS in the inward direction. hIK1 currents were reversibly blocked by charybdotoxin (Ki = 2.5 nM) and clotrimazole (Ki = 24.8 nM) but were minimally affected by apamin (100 nM), iberiotoxin (50 nM), or ketoconazole (10 microM). These biophysical and pharmacological properties are consistent with native intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, including the erythrocyte Gardos channel.

TI  - Increased leukocyte adhesiveness/aggregation in patients with recurrent TIA.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: White blood cells might have a pathogenetic role in ischemic vascular conditions. Several studies have suggested that increased adhesiveness of these cells could contribute to such a damage. The present study was undertaken in order to examine the adhesive properties of leukocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with various degrees of ischemic neuro-vascular diseases. METHODS: The percentage of aggregated white blood cells was determined by using a direct slide test. RESULTS: The respective values of aggregated cells in 28 patients with major stroke, 11 with minor stroke, 17 with a single TIA, 11 with recurrent TIAs and 18 controls were 15.9 +/- 7.4%, 6.6 +/- 3.3%, 3.0 +/- 2.6%, 10.9 +/- 8.4% and 1.5 +/- 0.4%. The difference between patients with a single TIA and those with recurrent TIAs being significant at P < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Being a sensitive marker of inflammation, our test might reveal the presence of an underlying smoldering inflammation in patients with recurrent TIA. These results are in agreement with modern studies that show that inflammation is an important feature of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Molecular cloning of cDNA and genomic DNA for human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylase.  
AB  - The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylase (1 alpha-hydroxylase) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This enzyme plays an important role in calcium homeostasis. Here we report the molecular cloning of cDNA and gene for human 1 alpha-hydroxylase. The cDNA clone was obtained from a human kidney cDNA library by cross-hybridization with a previously cloned rat cDNA probe. The cDNA consists of 2469 bp and encodes a protein of 508 amino acids that shows 82.5% sequence identity with the rat enzyme. A computer-aided homology search revealed that 1 alpha-hydroxylase shares a relatively high homology with vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase (about 40% amino acid identity). Northern blot analysis showed that the 2.5-kb mRNA is most abundant in kidney. The gene for human 1 alpha-hydroxylase spans approximately 6 kb, is composed of nine exons, and is present as a single copy. This molecular cloning makes it possible to investigate the genetic mechanism of diseases related to calcium metabolism, including vitamin D-dependency rickets type I. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

TI  - Characterization of the effects of amphotericin B on ion channels in MDCK cells using the patch-clamp technique.  
AB  - Cultured Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells were used as a model to study the mechanism of nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B using the patch-clamp technique. At the whole-cell level, amphotericin B altered potassium conductances in two types of these cells categorized on the basis of whole-cell potassium currents. The first cell type, classified as Type I, exhibited no significant whole-cell potassium currents. The second type, Type II, exhibited depolarization-induced outward potassium currents that rundown over time. In both of these subpopulations, exposure to amphotericin B at a concentration of 68 nM for a prolonged period of time (approximately 30-45 min) led to an increased whole-cell potassium conductance. In Type I cells, it increased by a factor of 16 and in Type II cells, by a factor of 3.5. Furthermore, the potassium currents observed in Type I cells following amphotericin B treatment bore no resemblance to currents through pores formed by amphotericin B in artificial membranes. At the single-channel level, incubation with amphotericin B led to a significantly higher potassium channel activity in both inside-out and outside-out patches. Kinetic studies in inside-out patches revealed that the increases in channel activity were associated with a decrease in the mean closed time and an overall increase in the mean open time. In summary, our data suggest that the direct toxicity of amphotericin B is primarily related to its ability to disturb normal ion channel functioning rather than to formation of pores in cell membranes.

TI  - Molecular dynamics study of free energy profiles for organic cations in gramicidin A channels.  
AB  - The free energy profiles for four organic cations in right-handed single-helix gramicidin A dimers were computed by using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics with CHARMM. Ion-water column translocations were facilitated by using a novel "water-tunnel" approach. The overlapping pieces of free energy profile for adjacent windows were selected from three trajectories that differed in initial ion rotation and were aligned by the method of umbrella potential differences. Neglected long-range electrostatic energies from the bulk water and the bilayer were computed with DelPhi and added to the profile. The approach was corroborated for the formamidinium-guanidinium pair by using perturbation dynamics at axial positions 0, 6, 12, and 15 A from the channel center. The barrier to ethylammonium entry was prohibitive at 21 kcal/mol, whereas for methylammonium it was 5.5 kcal/mol, and the profile was quite flat through the channel, roughly consistent with conductance measurements. The profile for formamidinium was very similar to that of methylammonium. Guanidinium had a high entry barrier (deltaF = +8.6 kcal/mol) and a narrow deep central well (deltaF = -2.6 kcal/mol), qualitatively consistent with predictions from voltage-dependent potassium current block measurements. Its deep central well, contrasting with the flat profile for formamidinium, was verified with perturbation dynamics and was correlated with its high propensity to form hydrogen bonds with the channel at the dimer junction (not shared by the other three cations). Analysis of the ensemble average radial forces on the ions demonstrates that all four ions undergo compressive forces in the channel that are at maximum at the center of the monomer and relieved at the dimer junction, illustrating increased flexibility of the channel walls in the center of the channel.

TI  - Prevention of bacterial endocarditis.  
AB  - A major review of the American Heart Association guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis was published in 1997. In view of changing perspectives on the population at risk for endocarditis and new information on the likelihood of particular procedures to place patients at risk, simplified guidelines have been developed. The role of invasive procedures as a risk factor is deemphasized, simplified single-dose strategies are suggested, and parenteral regimens are required less frequently. In addition, more extensive alternatives to erythromycin, including the newer macrolide antibiotics, are now part of the recommendations for patients who are unable to take penicillins. The new report also discusses the appropriateness of prophylaxis in the presence of the complicated issue of mitral valve prolapse and the relationship of valvar flow patterns to risk for endocarditis. Although no definitive randomized trials have been performed unequivocally establishing the benefits of endocarditis prophylaxis, the new guidelines represent an effort to favorably modify the risk-benefit ratio for use of antibiotics in the patient at risk. In addition to the new guidelines, other recent reports emphasize the importance of associated nonpharmacologic methods to prevent endocarditis, such as meticulous skin care and personal hygiene, and the need for a determined educational approach in the patient at risk to minimize risk. Recent reports have also emphasized the need for pediatric awareness of the changing patient population at risk for endocarditis and the need for increased vigilance in particular patients.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to use the EpiLight Hair Removal System to assess long-term epilation and to assess its safety profile following a single treatment session. METHODS: Patients received a single treatment with the Epilight Hair Removal System after entering the patient's skin type, skin color, hair color, and hair density into the system's computer software. Treatment parameters include various wavelengths of light, pulse duration, pulse delay, and energy fluence. Thirty-seven subjects received a single treatment using one of four cut-off filters consisting of two to five pulses with energies of 34-55 J/cm2. RESULTS: The results of a single treatment show hair clearances occurring immediately and over a 12-week study period. Approximately 60% hair removal was noted at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The EpiLight Hair Removal System is an effective and safe method for long-term epilation of unwanted hair.

The mRNA is resolved in the 5% gel; the protein, as expected, resolves in the 10% gel. Using a T7 expression system, we show that putative mRNA bands in the 5% gel are: 1) labeled only with 32P and not with 35S; 2) inducible with isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (needed to induce a T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of a lac promoter); 3) synthesized in the presence of rifampicin (T7 RNA polymerase is not inhibited by rifampicin); 4) degraded by base or RNase treatment; and 5) are largely resistant to DNase treatment. The mRNA bands were also evident in samples not treated with rifampicin. We used this technique to confirm previously published results that inhibition of expression by consecutive low-usage AGG arginine codons inserted near the 5' end of a test message in Escherichia coli is at the level of translation.

TI  - Fine specificity of antigen binding to two class I major histocompatibility proteins (B*2705 and B*2703) differing in a single amino acid residue.  
AB  - Starting from the X-ray structure of a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded protein (HLA-B*2705), a naturally presented self-nonapeptide and two synthetic analogues were simulated in the binding groove of two human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles (B*2703 and B*2705) differing in a single amino acid residue. After 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated HLA-peptide pairs, some molecular properties of the complexes (distances between ligand and protein center of masses, atomic fluctuations, buried versus accessible surface areas, hydrogen-bond frequencies) allow a clear discrimination of potent from weak MHC binders. The binding specificity of the three nonapeptides for the two HLA alleles could be explained by the disruption of one hydrogen-bonding network in the binding pocket of the HLA-B*2705 protein where the single mutation occurs. Rearrangements of interactions in the B pocket, which binds the side chain of peptide residue 2, and a weakening of interactions involving the C-terminal end of the peptide also took place. In addition, extension of the peptide backbone using a beta-Ala analogue did not abolish binding to any of the two HLA-B27 subtypes, but increased the selectivity for B*2703, as expected from the larger peptide binding groove in this subtype. A better understanding of the atomic details involved in peptide selection by closely related HLA alleles is of crucial importance for unraveling the molecular features linking particular HLA alleles to autoimmune diseases, and for the identification of antigenic peptides triggering such pathologies.

TI  - Unilateral posterior atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation.  
AB  - Bilateral posterior C 1-2 transfacet screw placement with associated posterior bone graft wiring is the accepted treatment for patients with atlantoaxial instability. This technique was modified to treat 19 patients with atlantoaxial instability and unilateral anomalies that prevented placement of a screw across the C1-2 facet. In these cases, a single contralateral transarticular screw was placed in conjunction with interspinous bone graft wiring to avoid neural or vertebral artery injury and to provide C1-2 stability. Postoperatively, all 19 patients were placed in Philadelphia collars (mean immobilization 8 weeks, range 6-12 weeks). Unilateral C1-2 facet screw fixation was needed for the following reasons: a high-riding transverse foramen of the C-2 vertebra present in 13 patients (left side in eight, right side in five), poor screw purchase in two (left side in both), screw malposition in one (left side), severe degenerative arthritis in one (right side), neurofibroma in one (right side), and fracture of the C-1 lateral mass in one (left side). Six weeks postsurgery, one patient presented with a broken screw and required occipitocervical fusion with a Steinmann pin and wire cable from the occiput to C-3 to achieve solid fusion. Solid fusions were achieved in the other 18 patients (mean follow-up period 31 months, range 14-54 months); there was no delayed screw breakage, wire breakage, or spinal instability. There were no operative or postoperative neurological or vascular complications. The authors' experience demonstrates that unilateral C1-2 facet screw fixation with interspinous bone graft wiring is an excellent alternative in the treatment of atlantoaxial instability when bilateral screw fixation is contraindicated.

TI  - Deciphering a neural code for vision.  
AB  - Deciphering the information that eyes, ears, and other sensory organs transmit to the brain is important for understanding the neural basis of behavior. Recordings from single sensory nerve cells have yielded useful insights, but single neurons generally do not mediate behavior; networks of neurons do. Monitoring the activity of all cells in a neural network of a behaving animal, however, is not yet possible. Taking an alternative approach, we used a realistic cell-based model to compute the ensemble of neural activity generated by one sensory organ, the lateral eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. We studied how the neural network of this eye encodes natural scenes by presenting to the model movies recorded with a video camera mounted above the eye of an animal that was exploring its underwater habitat. Model predictions were confirmed by simultaneously recording responses from single optic nerve fibers of the same animal. We report here that the eye transmits to the brain robust "neural images" of objects having the size, contrast, and motion of potential mates. The neural code for such objects is not found in ambiguous messages of individual optic nerve fibers but rather in patterns of coherent activity that extend over small ensembles of nerve fibers and are bound together by stimulus motion. Integrative properties of neurons in the first synaptic layer of the brain appear well suited to detecting the patterns of coherent activity. Neural coding by this relatively simple eye helps explain how horseshoe crabs find mates and may lead to a better understanding of how more complex sensory organs process information.

TI  - [Antimicrobial prophylaxis in urology]  
AB  - Antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery has proven to be effective in controlled randomized trials. Usage in Urology is known at least since the '30s although its effectiveness has only become known since 1979. METHODS: Review of literature related to surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, more specifically urological surgery, basically from 1991 to 1995, but without overlooking those papers that have become classics due to their impact. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis in urological surgery is nowadays beyond all doubt. Usage is indicated in the presence of sterile urine and dosage must be short, in single dosis in the immediate pre-operative or within 24 hours after the procedure. However, there is a number of issues that deserve to be treated in more detail for better understanding. Those are the establishment of adequate prophylactic regimes in renal transplantation and the use of antimicrobials based on their pharmacokinetic characteristics to optimize the prophylactic purpose.

Only a fast, single exponential phase is observed (bleach centered at v = 1633 cm-1 and transient absorbance at 1666 cm-1) with relaxation times of 38 ns at 30 degrees C and 36 ns at 57 degrees C; no additional slow (microsecond) phase is observed as previously found in the native form of apomyoglobin.

TI  - Fast events in protein folding: relaxation dynamics and structure of the I form of apomyoglobin.  
AB  - The fast relaxation dynamics of the acid destabilized I form of apomyoglobin (pH* 3, 0.15 M NaCl; apoMb-I) following a laser-induced temperature-jump have been probed using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Only a fast, single exponential phase is observed (bleach centered at v = 1633 cm-1 and transient absorbance at 1666 cm-1) with relaxation times of 38 ns at 30 degrees C and 36 ns at 57 degrees C; no additional slow (microsecond) phase is observed as previously found in the native form of apomyoglobin. Folding times of approximately 66 ns are derived from the observed rates based on a simple two-state model. The equilibrium melting of the 1633 cm-1 component shows noncooperative linear behavior over the temperature range studied (10-60 degrees C). The low amide I' frequency, the fast relaxation dynamics, and the noncooperative melting behavior are characteristic of isolated solvated helix. The analysis of the amide-I' band reveals another major component at 1650 cm-1 assigned to native-like structure stabilized by tertiary contacts involving the AGH core, which does not show dynamic or static melting under our conditions. ApoMb-I has generally been taken to be a "molten globule" species. The present results indicate a heterogeneous structure consisting of separate regions of native-like unit(s), solvated helices, and disordered coil, excluding a homogeneous molten globule as a model for apoMb-I. From the current studies and other results, a detailed model of the folding of apomyoglobin is presented.

TI  - Cloning, expression and functional activities of a single chain antibody fragment directed to fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: HNK20 is a murine IgA which is currently being investigated in clinical trials against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in infants and young children. OBJECTIVE: To produce a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) from HNK20 hybridoma cells and assess its functional activities in vitro and in vivo (mouse model). STUDY DESIGN: The V regions of heavy and light chains were cloned and linked by a sequence encoding for (Gly4 Ser)3 and expressed in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Over 100 mg/l of the HNK20-scFv was produced in shake flasks after induction with isopropyl (beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). ScFv was purified under native conditions on a Ni2+ affinity column and migrated as a single band of 34 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gels. ScFv demonstrated similar affinity as its parent IgA molecule, neutralized RSV in vitro and significantly reduced RSV titers in lungs of mice when administered intranasally shortly before or a day after RSV challenge. CONCLUSION: It is possible that this scFv or its derivatives, when applied by intranasal or pulmonary route, will be useful for treatment of RSV infections in infants and young children.

AB  -  The single path model of airway gas transport, with and without a distributed blood source term, was used to simulate multiple-breath N2 washout by breathing pure O2 in two lung models: a single-region lung model (SRLM) which produces series inhomogeneity, and a seven-region lung model (7RLM) incorporating both series and parallel inhomogeneities. Normalized phase III slopes (Sn) from N2 expirograms were computed for each breath and compared with published human experimental data obtained under similar conditions. The 7RLM predicts well the trend of experimental Sn N2 changes and is superior to the SRLM in the first part (the unsteady state), implying that this part of the curve is mostly due to convective mixing of the seven parallel flow streams. In the quasi-steady state, the 7RLM is not obviously superior to the SRLM. Functional residual capacity and pulmonary perfusion are shown to strongly affect the number of breaths required to reach the quasi-steady state. The anatomical dimensions that appear to be critical in SRLM are not as important in the 7RLM.

TI  - ["Tailored" polysomnography: an alternative method in the assessment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome]  
AB  - The conventional study of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) requires two polysomnographic recordings on two different nights, one for diagnosis and the other for determining an effective level of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In this study we examined an alternative method requiring a single night of polysomnographic recording encompassing both diagnostic and treatment functions. In order to obtain recordings of all phases of sleep, as well as recordings taken in supine decubitus position, the duration of polysomnographic readings was individualized ("made to order" polysomnograms). A single-night session was sufficient for diagnosis and for adjusting treatment in most cases. In some cases the night was extended well into the morning hours in an effort to obtain all the necessary data. "Made-to-order" polysomnograms were compared to traditional ones by contrasting breathing parameters (the U of Mann Whitney) and sleep architecture findings for two groups of men diagnosed consecutively of OSAS. Thirty-four patients were studied over two nights (mean age: 50 years; BMI 37 Kg/m2). Forty-six patients (mean age: 49 years; BMI: 38 Kg/m2) were studied in single-night sessions. The differences between the two groups were not significant. For most patients studied in "made to order" sessions, all sleep stages were recorded and readings were taken in supine position. REM sleep was not recorded, however, for 26% of the patients in this group. No significant differences between the double- and single-session groups were found for apnea (51 versus 62), maximum oxygen desaturation (72% versus 75%) and effective CPAP level (9 versus 10 cm H2O). These data suggest that both study methods are equally useful for evaluating OSAS severity and for prescribing effective CPAP treatment. We discuss, however, the need to arrange for two-night studies in the minority of patients for whom no REM sleep recordings become available during a single session.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic analysis of mizolastine in healthy young volunteers after single oral and intravenous doses: noncompartmental approach and compartmental modeling.  
AB  - This paper presents the analysis of the kinetics of a new antihistamine, mizolastine, in 18 healthy volunteers, from concentrations measured after an intravenous infusion and two different oral administrations: tablet and capsule. Two approaches were used to analyze these data: (i) a noncompartmental approach implemented in PHARM-NCA; (ii) a compartmental modeling approach implemented in a new S-PLUS library, NLS2, which allows the estimation of variance parameters simultaneously with the kinetic parameters. For the compartmental modeling approach, two-compartment open models were used. According to the Akaike criterion, the best model describing the kinetics of mizolastine after oral administration was the zero-order absorption model. The kinetic parameters obtained with PHARM-NCA and NLS2 were similar. The estimated duration of absorption was greater for the tablets than for the capsules (with means equal to 1.13 hr and 0.84 hr respectively). After an intravenous infusion, the mean estimated clearance was 4.9 L/hr, the mean lambda 2-phase apparent volume of distribution was 89.6 L and the mean terminal half-life was 12.9 hr.

AB  - Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure and has demonstrated its cardiovascular effects in experimental animal models, healthy volunteers and patients. The aim of this study was to find out whether or not differences in the pharmacokinetic profile and the haemodynamic response of a 100-mg single oral dose of captopril appeared between subjects of both sexes. Twenty-four young healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females) took part in the trial. Blood samples to assess captopril plasma concentrations, determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as well as haemodynamic variables, were obtained before and at different times following drug intake. Pharmacokinetic parameters did not show significant sex differences. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure exhibited a statistically significant decrease between 0.5 and 8 h in both sexes. No significant sex-related differences were found. The drug exhibited a good tolerability.

TI  - Linkage and association studies between the melanocortin receptors 4 and 5 genes and obesity-related phenotypes in the Quebec Family Study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The agouti yellow mouse shows adult onset of moderate obesity and diabetes. A depressed basal lipolytic rate in adipocytes or a decreased adrenergic tone arising from antagonizing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) activation of melanocortin receptors (MCR) could be at the origin of the obesity phenotype. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MCR 4 and 5 (MC4R, MC5R) genes were studied in the Quebec Family Study. Sequence variations were detected by Southern blot probing of restricted genomic DNA, and mRNA tissue expression was detected by RT-PCR. Subjects with a wide range of weight were used for single-point sib-pair linkage studies (maximum of 289 sibships from 124 nuclear families). Analysis of variance across genotypes in unrelated males (n = 143) and females (n = 156) was also undertaken. Body mass index (BMI), sum of six skin-folds (SF6), fat mass (FM), percent body fat (%FAT), respiratory quotient (RQ), resting metabolic rate (RMR), fasting glucose and insulin, and glucose and insulin area during an oral glucose tolerance test were analyzed. RESULTS: MC4R showed polymorphism with NcoI, and MC5R, with PstI and PvuII, with a heterozygosity of 0.38, 0.10, and 0.20, respectively. Linkages were observed between MC5R and BMI (p = 0.001), SF6 (p = 0.005), FM (p = 0.001), and RMR (p = 0.002), whereas associations were observed in females between MC5R and BMI (p = 0.003), and between MC4R and FM (p = 0.002) and %FAT (p = 0.004). After correction for multiple tests, these p values are lowered by one tenth. MC4R and MC5R mRNAs have been detected in brain, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: MC4R and MC5R exhibit evidence of linkage or association with obesity phenotypes, but this evidence is strongest for MC5R.

TI  - Highly sensitive single-step PCR protocol for diagnosis and monitoring of human cytomegalovirus infection in renal transplant recipients.  
AB  -  A multiplex, single-step PCR protocol for the detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA is described. The protocol amplifies regions of the viral LA and IE genes and employs elevated temperatures for both reagent mixing and primer annealing together with product detection by silver staining on polyacrylamide gels. This assay detects one to five HCMV genomes in clinical samples containing up to 100 ng of human DNA, a level of sensitivity equivalent to that of more complex assays involving either nested PCR or postamplification hybridization. As well as being of importance in clinical situations where high-sensitivity qualitative diagnosis is required, this assay is also applicable to the monitoring of HCMV infection in renal transplant recipients. Due to its multiplex format the assay provides quantitative information, in that samples from which a single target is amplified contain on average sevenfold fewer viral genomes per 10(6) leukocytes than those from which both targets are amplified. When weekly blood leukocyte DNA preparations from renal transplant patients were assayed, findings of three consecutive tests in which both HCMV targets were amplified were highly indicative of patients who had developed very high loads of HCMV (100% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We thus show that the same simple PCR assay which permits highly sensitive HCMV diagnosis can also be used for the efficient identification of transplant recipients at risk of clinically significant infection.

TI  - In vitro selection for altered divalent metal specificity in the RNase P RNA.  
AB  - The ribozyme RNase P absolutely requires divalent metal ions for catalytic function. Multiple Mg2+ ions contribute to the optimal catalytic efficiency of RNase P, and it is likely that the tertiary structure of the ribozyme forms a specific metal-binding pocket for these ions within the active-site. To identify base moieties that contribute to catalytic metal-binding sites, we have used in vitro selection to isolate variants of the Escherichia coli RNase P RNA with altered specificities for divalent metal. RNase P RNA variants with increased activity in Ca2+ were enriched over 18 generations of selection for catalysis in the presence of Ca2+, which is normally disfavored relative to Mg2+. Although a wide spectrum of mutations was found in the generation-18 clones, only a single point mutation was common to all clones: a cytosine-to-uracil transition at position 70 (E. coli numbering) of RNase P. Analysis of the C70U point mutant in a wild-type background confirmed that the identity of the base at position 70 is the sole determinant of Ca2+ selectivity. It is noteworthy that C70 lies within the phylogenetically well conserved J3/4-P4-J2/4 region, previously implicated in Mg2+ binding. Our finding that a single base change is sufficient to alter the metal preference of RNase P is further evidence that the J3/4-P4-J2/4 domain forms a portion of the ribozyme's active site.

TI  - Identification of a mutation in the MP19 gene, Lim2, in the cataractous mouse mutant To3.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Lim2, the gene encoding the second most abundant lens specific integral membrane protein, MP19, has recently been proposed as an ideal candidate gene for the cataractous mouse mutant, To3. The aim of this study was to screen the Lim2 gene in the To3 mutant for a genetic lesion that was correlated and consistent with the mutant phenotype. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from both normal mouse parental strains as well as the heterozygous and homozygous To3 cataract mutant. PCR was used to generate overlapping fragments of the entire Lim2 gene from these DNAs. The coding regions, including splice junctions and the translational termination site, of these fragments were then sequenced. RESULTS: A single G -> T transversion was identified within the first coding exon of the Lim2 gene in the To3 mutant DNA. This DNA change results in the nonconservative substitution of a valine for the normally encoded glycine at amino acid 15 of the MP19 polypeptide. CONCLUSIONS: The identified genetic lesion in the Lim2 gene of the cataractous mouse mutant, To3, confirms Lim2 as an ideal candidate gene. Future transgenic experiments should provide proof or disproof of a causative relationship between the identified mutation and the cataractous phenotype. These studies indicate that MP19 may play an important role in both normal lens development and cataractogenesis, and warrants more intense investigation of its role within the ocular lens.

TI  - Streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigen-induced lymphocytic arteritis in a local type experimental model: comparison with acute vasculitis in the Arthus reaction.  
AB  - Many pathogenic bacteria produce superantigenic exotoxins. To study their pathogenetic role, in particular to test whether these toxins are able to induce vasculitis, we developed a local-type experimental model in rabbits. Toxins were injected along the intermediate auricular artery of the ear. The histology of ear skin, including the artery, was examined after single or repeated injections. Repeated injections of streptococcal erythrogenic toxins produced chronic-type arteritis characteristic of lymphocytic infiltration, whereas single injection induced no acute-type vasculitis. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 also induced the same type of arteritis, although weaker in degree. In human patients these lesions are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis with unknown etiology. The Arthus reaction to human serum albumin in immunized rabbits included acute-type vasculitis similar to polyarteritis nodosa when examined in this model. Microvasculitis lesions similar to leukoclastic vasculitis were combined in the Arthus reaction but not in the superantigen-induced lesions. Our experimental model described here is widely applicable to the study of the etiology and pathogenesis of human diseases involving vasculitis lesions.

TI  - The current status of the treatment for hemorrhagic type moyamoya disease based on a 1995 nationwide survey in Japan.  
AB  - The optimal treatment regimen for hemorrhagic type Moyamoya disease has yet to be clearly established. Furthermore, it remains unclear as to whether or not bypass surgery can help prevent future intracranial hemorrhaging in Moyamoya patients. In Japan, several treatment options, such as conservative, medical, and surgical intervention, have been employed for the treatment of hemorrhagic type of Moyamoya disease. In this study, 282 hemispheres with hemorrhagic onset were analyzed based on a 1995 nationwide survey by the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis (Moyamoya Disease) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare Japan to clarify the current status of treatment for hemorrhagic type Moyamoya disease. Questionnaires were distributed to the departments of neurology, neurosurgery, and pediatrics all over Japan asking about both treatment and rebleeding. As a result, 12.5% of the affected hemispheres were treated conservatively while 32.3% were medically treated. Ventricular drainage and/or hematoma removal was performed in 15.8%, and revascularization surgery in 38.3% of all hemorrhagic sides. Among the revascularization procedures used, 45.7% of the hemispheres underwent single indirect bypass surgery, such as EDAS while 22.2% of them received a direct (superficial temporal artery--middle cerebral artery: STA-MCA) bypass surgery. A combination of direct and indirect bypass surgery or a combination of different kinds of indirect procedures comprised 32.1%. Forty-nine out of 282 hemorrhagic hemispheres demonstrated rebleeding. An intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 15 hemispheres with ischemic onset even though nine of them had undergone bypass surgery prior to hemorrhaging. Nearly 18% of the patients with hemorrhagic type disease experienced rebleeding regardless of the treatment modalities. Based on these findings, there remains no clearly superior treatment plan for hemorrhagic Moyamoya disease to prevent rebleeding at this time. However, the selection of patients, treatment modalities, and the timing of the surgery might all play an important role in controlling rebleeding. The final outcome of the patients are therefore mainly considered to correlate with the initial severity of the clinical features.

TI  - Adeno-associated virus type 2-mediated gene transfer: correlation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular single-stranded D sequence-binding protein with transgene expression in human cells in vitro and murine tissues in vivo.  
AB  - Although the adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV)-based vector system has gained attention as a potentially useful alternative to the more commonly used retroviral and adenoviral vectors for human gene therapy, the single-stranded nature of the viral genome, and consequently the rate-limiting second-strand viral DNA synthesis, significantly affect its transduction efficiency. We have identified a cellular tyrosine phosphoprotein, designated the single-stranded D sequence-binding protein (ssD-BP), which interacts specifically with the D sequence at the 3' end of the AAV genome and may prevent viral second-strand DNA synthesis in HeLa cells (K. Y. Qing et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:10879-10884, 1997). In the present studies, we examined whether the phosphorylation state of the ssD-BP correlates with the ability of AAV to transduce various established and primary cells in vitro and murine tissues in vivo. The efficiencies of transduction of established human cells by a recombinant AAV vector containing the beta-galactosidase reporter gene were 293 > KB > HeLa, which did not correlate with the levels of AAV infectivity. However, the amounts of dephosphorylated ssD-BP which interacted with the minus-strand D probe were also as follows: 293 > KB > HeLa. Predominantly the phosphorylated form of the ssD-BP was detected in cells of the K562 line, a human erythroleukemia cell line, and in CD34+ primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells; consequently, the efficiencies of AAV-mediated transgene expression were significantly lower in these cells. Murine Sca-1+ lin- primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells contained predominantly the dephosphorylated form of the ssD-BP, and these cells could be efficiently transduced by AAV vectors. Dephosphorylation of the ssD-BP also correlated with expression of the adenovirus E4orf6 protein, known to induce AAV gene expression. A deletion mutation in the E4orf6 gene resulted in a failure to catalyze dephosphorylation of the ssD-BP. Extracts prepared from mouse brain, heart, liver, lung, and skeletal-muscle tissues, all of which are known to be highly permissive for AAV-mediated transgene expression, contained predominantly the dephosphorylated form of the ssD-BP. Thus, the efficiency of transduction by AAV vectors correlates well with the extent of the dephosphorylation state of the ssD-BP in vitro as well as in vivo. These data suggest that further studies on the cellular gene that encodes the ssD-BP may promote the successful use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy.

TI  - Evidence for cyclophosphamide-induced gene conversion and mutation in mouse germ cells.  
AB  - Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a widely used antineoplastic drug. It tests positive in several genotoxicity assays, including those with endpoints such as chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, and dominant lethal mutations in rodents. We have explored the effects of CP on genome stability of mouse (Mus domesticus) spermatogenic cells, using a recombination-based transgenic assay called MUSCATEER. In this system, intrachromosomal gene conversion events between two mutually defective lacZ genes generates beta-galactosidase activity in spermatids. The frequency of gene conversion events is determined by scoring spermatids stained with the lacZ substrate, X-gal. A dose-dependent induction of lacZ-positive spermatids was observed following single intraperitoneal CP exposures of 10, 100, and 200 mg/kg. At 200 mg/kg, there was a 25-fold increase over baseline. Treatment of a control transgenic line containing only a frame-shifted lacZ transgene provided an indication that CP also induced reversion mutations. The timing of the response indicated that the induction of recombination and/or mutation occurred primarily in meiotic stage cells. These results demonstrate potent germline mutagenicity of CP, and validate the utility and sensitivity of genetic recombination as a rapid indicator of genotoxicity in whole animals.

TI  - Exon-intron structure, analysis of promoter region, and chromosomal localization of the human type 1 sigma receptor gene.  
AB  - Sigma receptor is a protein that interacts with a variety of psychotomimetic drugs including cocaine and amphetamines and is believed to play an important role in the cellular functions of various tissues associated with the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Here we report on the structure and organization of the human gene coding for this receptor. The gene is approximately 7 kbp long and contains four exons, interrupted by three introns. Exon 3 is the shortest (93 bp), and exon 4 is the longest (1,132 bp). Among the introns, intron 3 is the longest (approximately 1,250 bp). Exon 2 codes for the single transmembrane domain present in the receptor. 5' rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions with mRNA from the JAR human trophoblast cell line have identified 56 bp upstream of the translation start codon as the initiation site for transcription. This transcription start site has been confirmed by RNase protection analysis. Structural analysis of the 5' flanking region has revealed that the gene is TATA-less. This region, however, contains a CCAATC box in the reverse complement and several GC boxes that are recognition sites for SP1. There are also consensus sequences for the liver-specific transcription factor nuclear factor-1/L, for a variety of cytokine responsive factors, and for the xenobiotic responsive factor called the arylhydrocarbon receptor. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA from Chinese hamster-human and mouse-human hybrid cell lines and fluorescent in situ hybridization with human metaphase chromosome spreads have shown that the gene is located on human chromosome 9, band p13, a region known to be associated with different psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Posture, spontaneous movements, and behavioural state organisation in infants affected by brain malformations.  
AB  - Posture, quantity of spontaneous movement patterns, quality of general movements (GMs), and behavioural state organisation were studied in nine infants affected by documented brain malformations. A single 1 h video recording of five infants and two or more serial video recordings of another four infants were performed after birth. The graphic representation of single movement patterns (actogram) and of behavioural states of one video recording was performed in eight out of nine infants. The quality of GMs was assessed according to Prechtl's method in all video recordings. All nine infants showed a less variable posture than normal newborn infants and an unusual resting posture was detected in seven infants. Poor behavioural state organisation without sleep cycles was common to the nine infants and excessive wakefulness was observed in six infants. As for the quantity of single movement patterns, six infants lacked one or two movement patterns normally present in healthy newborn infants. An abnormal quality of GMs was noted in all nine infants and distinct motor abnormalities were observed in single infants. A monotonous and sometimes stereotyped sequence of different body parts involved in the movement (i.e. poor repertoire GMs) was common to all infants. In the four infants of whom two or more video recordings were available, initial poor repertoire GMs were followed by a further deterioration in movement quality. No relationship was found between the quantity of defective brain tissue, lack of a specific part of the brain, type and severity of GM and posture abnormalities.

The virtually complete rescue that we had previously observed with transplants of fetal central nervous system (CNS) tissues may, therefore, be due at least in part to NT-3, but the exogenous administration of a single neurotrophic factor or a combination of neurotrophic factors is less effective than transplants in producing long-term survival of axotomized CNS neurons.

TI  - Neurotrophin-3 prevents death of axotomized Clarke's nucleus neurons in adult rat.  
AB  - In the present investigation, we studied whether neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) contributes to the rescue of axotomized Clarke's nucleus (CN) neurons in adult rats. A significant (24%) loss of CN neurons occurred at L-1 ipsilateral to T-8 hemisection by 14 days, which reached 31% at 2 months and then stabilized. Axotomized CN neurons had also atrophied by 14 days, but mean cell size did not decrease further. Animals that received gelfoam soaked in nerve growth factor, brain derived neurotrophic factor, or ciliary neurotrophic factor at the lesion site also showed a 30% neuron loss at 2 months, and a 40% reduction in average cell area. Rats receiving NT-3 showed a 15% neuron loss, which was not improved by additional neurotrophins in combination with NT-3. None of the treatments prevented neuron atrophy. Bioassay of the gelfoam showed that NT-3 bioactivity remained at 5 days after surgery but not at 14 days. Additional rats with hemisections that received NT-3 continuously via mini-pump for 2 months showed a 15% neuron loss, the same as with NT-3 given via gelfoam. These results indicate that even limited exposure of axotomized CN neurons to NT-3 produces permanent rescue of 50% of the neurons. The virtually complete rescue that we had previously observed with transplants of fetal central nervous system (CNS) tissues may, therefore, be due at least in part to NT-3, but the exogenous administration of a single neurotrophic factor or a combination of neurotrophic factors is less effective than transplants in producing long-term survival of axotomized CNS neurons.

TI  - Frequency resolution and spectral integration (critical band analysis) in single units of the cat primary auditory cortex.  
AB  - Frequency resolution and spectral filtering in the cat primary auditory cortex (AI) were mapped by extracellular recordings of tone responses in white noise of various bandwidths. Single-tone excitatory tuning curves, critical bandwidths, and critical ratios were determined as a function of neuronal characteristic frequency and tone level. Single-tone excitatory tuning curves are inadequate measures of frequency resolution and spectral filtering in the AI, because their shapes (in most neurons) deviated substantially from the shapes of "tuning curves for complex sound analysis", the curves determined by the band limits of the critical bandwidths. Perceptual characteristics of spectral filtering (intensity independence and frequency dependence) were found in average critical bandwidths of neurons from the central and ventral AI. The highest frequency resolution (smallest critical bandwidths) reached by neurons in the central and ventral AI equaled the psychophysical frequency resolution. The dorsal AI is special, since most neurons there had response properties incompatible with psychophysical features of frequency resolution. Perceptual characteristics of critical ratios were not found in the average neuronal responses in any area of the AI. It seems that spectral integration in the way proposed to be the basis for the perception of tones in noise is not present at the level of the AI.

AB  - Genetic diversity patterns in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems and in low versus high mutation rate systems do not support the hypothesis of a recent African origin for all of humanity following a split between Africans and non-Africans 100,000 years ago, nor do genetic distance data. Geographical analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial gene trees do not support the hypothesis of a recent global replacement of humans coming out of Africa, although a local replacement event in Europe is indicated by these analyses and recent studies on Neandertal DNA. The gene tree analyses instead indicate that genetic interchanges have ensured that all of humanity has evolved as a single evolutionary lineage with no major splits.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of a transverse tubularized segment(s) of ileum in the Mitrofanoff or Malone antegrade colonic enema (MACE) procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients in three centres underwent the formation of a continent conduit to bowel (MACE, eight patients) and/or bladder (Mitrofanoff, four) using either a single segment of transverse tubularized ileum (10 patients) or two segments of ileum anastomosed and tubularized into a single conduit (two). RESULTS: Within a follow-up of 8 weeks to 6 months, all conduits were continent and catheterized easily. One stomal stenosis required a revision procedure. CONCLUSION: This method for forming a continent catheterizing conduit, based on the Mitrofanoff principle, appears to be effective and is recommended in cases where the appendix cannot be used or where a second conduit is required.

TI  - Split liver transplantation: King's College Hospital experience.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of split liver transplantation is to increase the source of pediatric grafts without compromising the adult donor pool. Early results have been discouraging because of technical complications and selection of poor risk patients. METHODS: The results of a single center experience of 41 split liver transplantations were analyzed. Patient and graft survival and complications related to the technique were analyzed. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival for the whole group was 90% and 88% respectively at a median follow up of 12 months (range 6-70 months). Patient and graft survival for the right lobe graft was 95% and the left lateral segment 86% and 82% respectively. Four patients died, of which two of the patients were first two splits following technical complications. Two others died, one from cerebral lymphoma and the other of multiorgan failure secondary to sepsis. One patient has been retransplanted for chronic biliary sepsis. CONCLUSION: Split liver transplantation has now become an acceptable treatment option for both adult and pediatric recipients with end stage liver disease. Right lobe recipients are not disadvantaged by the procedure. Good results can be achieved with better patient selection and by the use of good quality organs.

TI  - Cloning and molecular characterization of a strawberry fruit ripening-related cDNA corresponding a mRNA for a low-molecular-weight heat-shock protein.  
AB  - We have isolated and characterized a cDNA from a strawberry fruit subtractive library that shows homology to class-I low-molecular-weight (LMW) heat-shock protein genes from other higher plants. The strawberry cDNA (clone njjs4) was a 779 bp full-length cDNA with a single open reading frame of 468 bp that is expected to encode a protein of ca. 17.4 kDa with a pI of 6.57. Southern analysis with genomic DNA showed several high-molecular-weight hybridization bands, indicating that the corresponding njjs4 gene is not present as a single copy in the genome. This strawberry gene was not expressed in roots, leaves, flowers and stolons but in fruits at specific stages of elongation and ripening. However, a differential pattern of mRNA expression was detected in the fruit tissues achenes and receptacle. The njjs4 gene expression increased in achenes accompanying the process of seed maturation whereas in the receptacle, a high mRNA expression was detected in the W2 stage, during which most of the metabolic changes leading to the fruit ripening are occurring. Our results clearly show a specific relationship of this njjs4 strawberry gene with the processes of seed maturation and fruit ripening, and strongly support that at least some of the class-I LMW heat-shock protein-like genes have a heat-stress-independent role in plant development, including fruit ripening.

TI  - Regenerated dorsal root fibers form functional synapses in embryonic spinal cord transplants.  
AB  - 1. The aim of the present study was to determine whether synapses formed by dorsal root afferents that regenerate into intraspinal transplants of fetal spinal cord are functional. Severed L4 or L5 dorsal root stumps were placed at the bottom of dorsal quadrant cavities made in the lumbar spinal cords of adult rats and juxtaposed to embryonic day 14 spinal cord transplants. 2. In animals examined 5-10 weeks later, we recorded extracellularly in transplants from 43 units that fired in response to electrical stimulation of the implanted dorsal root. Latency fluctuations of extracellular firing that increase with stimulus and failure to follow high-frequency and posttetanic potentiation of extracellular firing stimulation suggest that synapses with conventional properties are formed between regenerating afferents and transplant neurons. Limited intracellular recordings confirmed the existence of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in transplant neurons after dorsal root stimulation. 3. In 16 units, extracellular firing occurred in response to single shock stimulation. The remainder of the units required two or more dorsal root shocks to evoke firing; some of these connections also may be monosynaptic. 4. Under the assumption that single shock firing was most likely the result of monosynaptic connections between transplant neurons and regenerated dorsal root fibers, we estimated the conduction velocities of regenerated fibers. These estimates suggest that fibers with conduction velocities in the C, A delta, and A alpha/beta ranges regenerate into transplants of embryonic spinal cord. 5. The results demonstrate that regenerated dorsal root axons establish functional synaptic connections with transplant neurons. The implications for using fetal transplants to help rebuild spinal reflex circuits after spinal cord injury are considered.

TI  - Streptavidin in antibody pretargeting. Comparison of a recombinant streptavidin with two streptavidin mutant proteins and two commercially available streptavidin proteins.  
AB  - In this investigation, a comparison of wild type recombinant streptavidin (r-SAv) with two genetically engineered mutant r-SAv proteins was undertaken. The investigation also included a comparison of the r-SAv with two streptavidin (SAv) proteins from commercial sources. In vitro characterization of the SAv proteins was conducted by HPLC, SDS-PAGE, IEF, and electrospray mass spectral analyses. All SAv proteins studied appeared to be a single species by size exclusion chromatography (HPLC) and SDS-PAGE analyses, but multiple species were noted in the IEF and MS analyses. In vivo comparisons of the SAv proteins were accomplished with dual isotope-labeled SAv in athymic mice. In an initial experiment, tissue localization of r-[131I]SAv directly radiolabeled using chloramine-T was compared with r-SAv radiolabeled with the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl p-iodobenzoate conjugate ([125I]-PIB), a radioiodination reagent that has been shown to result in iodine-labeled proteins which are stable to in vivo deiodination. The data obtained indicated that there is little difference in the distribution (except kidney localization) when r-SAv labeled by the two methods. Data obtained from comparison of r-[131I]SAv with a disulfide-stabilized r-SAv mutant (r-SAv-H127C), a C-terminal cysteine-containing r-SAv mutant (r-[125I]SAv-S139C), and two 125I-labeled SAv proteins obtained from commercial sources indicated that their distributions were quite similar, except the kidney concentrations were generally lower than that of r-[131I]SAv. On the basis of the similar distributions of the SAv proteins studied, it appears that the r-SAv mutants may be interchanged for the (wild type) r-SAv in pretargeting studies. Further, the similarity of distributions with two commercially available SAv proteins suggests that the results obtained in our studies and those of other groups may be directly compared (with consideration of animal model, sacrifice time, etc.).

TI  - Ondansetron is not superior to moderate dose metoclopramide in the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting after minor gynaecological surgery.  
AB  - Peri-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), remain a considerable problem. Ondansetron is being promoted currently as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of PONV. Experiments to investigate efficacy of ondansetron in PONV have been made with placebo or single doses of other drugs, e.g. metoclopramide, and often with different anaesthetic regimes with different emetic potential. This study investigated the relative benefits, in the prevention of PONV, of ondansetron compared with metoclopramide used at a dose higher than used in previous studies. Ninety-six patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery were randomized to receive either ondansetron 4 mg or metoclopramide 0.4 mg kg-1. The patients were then assessed in the recovery room, in the day ward prior to discharge and the following day for the occurrence of PONV. Emetic symptoms occurred in similar proportions of patients who received ondansetron and metoclopramide. Nausea scores were similar between the groups in the recovery ward and 24-h follow-ups but there were higher post-operative nausea scores in the ondansetron group in the day ward (P = 0.001). There were no significant side effects due to either drug. We conclude that moderate dose metoclopramide is an effective alternative to ondansetron in the control of PONV.

TI  - Guglielmi detachable coil embolization for unruptured aneurysms in nonsurgical candidates: a cost-effectiveness exploration.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio for Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization versus no therapy for unruptured intracranial aneurysms considered inappropriate for surgical clipping procedures. METHODS: Decision tree and Markov analyses that employ cohort simulation were applied to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of GDC embolization versus no therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Clinical values required as input data were estimated from the literature for the following variables: relative frequencies of complete aneurysmal occlusion, partial aneurysmal occlusion, and attempted coiling (no coils detached); morbidity and mortality of GDC embolization; frequency, morbidity, and mortality of spontaneous aneurysmal rupture in untreated and GDC-embolized aneurysms; annual rate of recanalization of GDC-embolized aneurysms; quality of life when knowingly living with untreated or GDG-embolized aneurysms and of living with fixed neurologic deficit; costs of GDC embolization, spontaneous aneurysmal rupture, stroke, and rehabilitation; and discount rate. Cost-utility ratios below $50000 per quality-adjusted life year saved were considered acceptable. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input variables. RESULTS: Baseline input values resulted in acceptable cost-utility ratios for GDC embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. These ratios remained within acceptable limits across wide ranges of various input parameters. Cost-effectiveness was markedly affected by the natural course of unruptured, untreated aneurysms; rates of spontaneous rupture greater than 2% per year resulted in favorable cost-utility ratios that were relatively unaffected by variation in GDC efficacy, while rates of rupture less than 1% per year resulted in unfavorable ratios that were highly dependent on GDC efficacy. Many of the GDC efficacy indexes, such as rate of failed coiling, early recanalization, and progressive aneurysmal thrombosis, have mild effects on the cost-utility ratios. GDC complication rate as well as life expectancy had moderate effects on the analysis. The influence of late aneurysmal recanalization was mild unless high rates of rupture for partially coiled aneurysms were applied. Suboptimal clip placement resulting from the presence of GDC coils within a ruptured aneurysm had no demonstrable consequence on cost-utility ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The single most influential variable determining the cost-effectiveness of GDC embolization in our analysis was the natural course of untreated aneurysms. Other important variables included GDC-related morbidity and life expectancy at the time of GDC embolization.

TI  - Angiographic follow-up and clinical experience with the flexible Tantalum Cordis stent.  
AB  - The Cordis stent is a flexible, highly radioopaque intracoronary stent engineered from a single Tantalum filament folded into a sinusoidal helical coil. It is premounted on a semicompliant balloon expandable stent delivery system. From September 1995-March 1996, 147 Cordis stents were deployed in 105 patients (aged 58+/-12 yr, 71% male). Clinical indications for stenting were unstable angina in 59 (55%), stable angina in 41 (38%), and acute myocardial infarction in 7 (7%). The target vessel was the right coronary artery in 45%, the left anterior descending in 31%, and the circumflex artery in 22%. One stent was deployed in a vein graft, and one stent was deployed in a left internal mammary artery graft. Stent deployment was achieved in all but one patient. Acute in-stent thrombosis occurred in 3 patients (2.9%). Two of these patients required urgent coronary artery bypass surgery. Subacute stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients (1.9%). Minimum lumen diameter increased from 0.70+/-0.41 mm to 3.50+/-0.60 mm following stent placement. All patients received aspirin. Eighty-one patients (77%) received ticlopidine, and 4 patients (4%) received warfarin therapy. The mean hospital stay was 3.4+/-2.3 days. Six-month follow-up angiography was performed on 50 out of 55 eligible patients at one of the two institutions involved in this study. Computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography defined a restenosis rate of 26%. Repeat revascularization was required in 8 patients (14.5%) at 6-mo follow-up. The Tantalum Cordis intracoronary stent is an effective and safe means of treating coronary lesions, even in patients with unstable ischemic syndromes. Acute and subacute rates of in-stent thrombosis were acceptable, and the long-term angiographic restenosis rates and need for repeat revascularization were favorable.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of the potential drug interaction between venlafaxine and ethanol.  
AB  - Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant with a unique mode of action. Because many patients taking antidepressant therapy may self-medicate with ethanol, this study was undertaken to assess the possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between venlafaxine and ethanol. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study was conducted with 16 healthy men. Multiple doses of venlafaxine (50 mg every 8 hours) or placebo were administered for 7 days. On days 5 and 7 a single dose of 0.5 g/kg of ethanol or a placebo solution was administered in a randomized fashion. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that ethanol administration did not affect the disposition of venlafaxine or O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Similarly, venlafaxine administration did not affect the pharmacokinetic disposition of ethanol. Ethanol produced its expected effects on the eight psychometric tests administered. Venlafaxine produced small effects on the results of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Divided Attention Reaction Time, and the Profile of Mood States. No pharmacodynamic interaction was detected between venlafaxine and ethanol.

TI  - Reduced Tyk2/SHP-1 interaction and lack of SHP-1 mutation in a kindred of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  
AB  - Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH) is an autosomal recessive disease with features similar to those of the murine motheaten phenotype resulting from mutations of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. This has raised the possibility that defects in SHP-1 or SHP-1-regulated signaling molecules may be present in FHLH. In this study, we examined SHP-1 protein and transcript in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an FHLH family. Our results show that the FHLH patient and the parents express comparable levels of a single SHP-1 protein and that the SHP-1 cDNA clone from the patient contains no mutation in the coding region. Interestingly, a reduced association of SHP-1 with the Jak family kinase Tyk2 was detected in the patient and the defect appears to have been inherited from one of the parents. This reduced SHP-1/Tyk2 association is likely due to a defect in Tyk2 or in cellular factors regulating Tyk2, because we found no abnormalities in SHP-1 or in SHP-1 association with the other Jak kinases. These data demonstrate that the SHP-1 gene is intact in FHLH and that the defect in some cases with this disease may involve signaling molecules regulated by SHP-1.

TI  - The post-incision steps of the DNA base excision repair pathway in Escherichia coli: studies with a closed circular DNA substrate containing a single U:G base pair.  
AB  - The DNA base excision repair pathway is responsible for removal of oxidative and endogenous DNA base damage in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This pathway involves formation of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in the DNA, which is further processed to restore the integrity of the DNA. In Escherichia coli it has been suggested that the major mode of repair involves replacement of a single nucleotide at the AP site, based on repair synthesis studies using oligonucleotide substrates containing a unique uracil base. The mechanism of the post-incision steps of the bacterial base excision repair pathway was examined using a DNA plasmid substrate containing a single U:G base pair. Repair synthesis carried out by repair-proficient ung, recJ and xon E.coli cell extracts was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage of the DNA containing the uracil lesion. It was found that replacement of the uracil base was always accompanied by replacement of several nucleotides ( approximately 15) 3' of the uracil and this process was absolutely dependent on initial removal of the uracil base by the action of uracil-DNA glycosylase. In contrast to findings with oligonucleotide substrates, replacement of just a single nucleotide at the lesion site was not detected. These results suggest that repair patch length may be substrate dependent and a re-evaluation of the post-incision steps of base excision repair is suggested.

We found no gross differences in the presence of oscillin in semen samples from men who presented with 70%, 40%, 25% or 2% of membrane-intact spermatozoa. By immunofluorescence, membrane-intact (HOS-positive) spermatozoa showed staining of a single band at the equatorial region, whereas over 80% of HOS-negative spermatozoa consistently showed a diffuse distribution of oscillin over the sperm head. However, some individuals presented with up to 50% of HOS-positive spermatozoa showing an aberrant localization of oscillin. We found a significant correlation rate (r=0.70, P < 0.05) between the percentage of HOS-positive spermatozoa with an equatorial oscillin localization and the fertilization rates achieved after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. These data suggest that the localization of oscillin in human spermatozoa might have an impact on egg activation and fertilization rates.

However, the use of quantitative dobutamine 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT imaging for enhanced detection of coronary stenosis has not been established. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of dobutamine stress on regional myocardial blood flow and relative myocardial 99mTc-sestamibi activity in the presence of a single-vessel stenosis. METHODS: In six open-chest dogs with left circumflex artery stenosis, radiolabeled microspheres were injected during baseline, severe stenosis and peak dobutamine stress (10 microg/kg/min). Technetium-99m-sestamibi was injected intravenously at peak dobutamine. Hearts were excised 20 min after 99mTc-sestamibi injection for SPECT imaging and post-mortem gamma-well counting. RESULTS: Dobutamine significantly increased heart rate, rate-pressure product and the first derivative of left ventricular pressure. Ischemic zone (left circumflex) myocardial blood flows (in ml/min/g) were: baseline, 0.92 +/- 0.15; stenosis, 0.65 +/- 0.16; and dobutamine, 1.19 +/- 0.38. Nonischemic zone myocardial blood flows were: baseline, 0.99 +/- 0.18; stenosis, 1.01 +/- 0.12; and dobutamine, 1.94 +/- 0.32 (p < 0.01 versus stenosis). Ischemic flows, expressed as percentages of nonischemic flows, were: baseline, 94% +/- 2%; stenosis, 63% +/- 11% (p < 0.05 versus baseline) and dobutamine, 60% +/- 12% (p was not significant versus stenosis). Technetium-99m-sestamibi activity in the ischemic zone (75% +/- 6% nonischemic) underestimated the relative flow deficit produced during dobutamine stress (p = 0.056). Myocardial 99mTc-sestamibi activity correlated with flow when flow was less than 1.0 ml/min/g. At higher flow ranges (1.0 ml/min/g-3.5 ml/min/g), 99mTc-sestamibi did not track flow. CONCLUSION: In a canine model of flow-limiting, single-vessel stenosis, dobutamine (10 microg/kg/min) did not augment flow heterogeneity. In addition, relative myocardial 99mTc-sestamibi activity underestimated microsphere flow at higher flows induced by dobutamine, leading to underestimation of ischemia. These findings suggest that dobutamine stress 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy may underestimate the relative flow deficit.

TI  - Metastatic carcinoma to the male and female breast.  
AB  - Metastases to the female breast are rare and those to the male breast are even rarer. Differentiating primary from metastatic breast carcinoma is important for rational therapy and avoidance of unnecessary radical surgery. Data on five women and two men with metastases to the breast are presented here. The primary tumours in these seven cases were as follows: three bronchogenic carcinoma and one each from papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary, adenocarcinoma of the colon, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. In both men (who had primary lung carcinoma), mammograms showed dense glandular tissue occupying nearly the entire breast. All five women had multiple nodules. Two of these cases were unilateral and three were bilateral. The metastatic nodules were round, with slightly irregular or ill-defined margins and calcification in the single case from metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Ultrasonograms demonstrated well-circumscribed low-echoic masses in all cases. In a patient with known extramammary malignancy and a breast mass, mammograms and ultrasonograms should be undertaken to exclude a primary breast carcinoma and for proper management.

TI  - Crystal structure of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.  
AB  - The structure of the glycolytic enzyme class I fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Homotetrameric P. falciparum aldolase (PfALDO) crystallizes in space group P3221 with one 80 kDa dimer per asymmetric unit. The final refined PfALDO model has an R-factor of 0.239 and an R-free of 0.329 with respect to data from 8 to 3.0 A resolution. PfALDO is potentially a target for antimalarial drug design as the intraerythrocytic merozoite lifestage of P. falciparum is completely dependent upon glycolysis for its ATP production. Thus, inhibitors directed against the glycolytic enzymes in P. falciparum may be effective in killing the parasite. The structure of PfALDO is compared with the previously determined structure of human aldolase in order to determine possible targets for the structure-based design of selective PfALDO ligands. The salient structural differences include a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of PfALDO, which results from some amino acid changes and a single residue deletion compared with human aldolase, and the overall quaternary structure of the PfALDO tetramer, which buries less surface area than human aldolase.

AB  - We present two unrelated children, a male and a female, with signs of ectodermal dysplasia, mental retardation, agenesis/ dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and primary hypothyroidism. Reports of ectodermal dysplasia with CNS malformations or hypothyroidism or both are rare. We suggest that the condition we describe is a distinct entity within the large group of ectodermal dysplasia syndromes and that it has a variable clinical spectrum. As both males and females are affected and in a few reports some parents show minimal signs, the inheritance is likely to be autosomal dominant.

TI  - The distal elements, OCT and SPH, stimulate the formation of preinitiation complexes on a human U6 snRNA gene promoter in vitro.  
AB  - The distal control region of a human U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene promoter contains two separable elements, octamer (OCT) and SPH, found in many vertebrate snRNA genes. Complete distal regions generally account for a 4- to 100-fold stimulation of snRNA gene promoters. We examined the mechanism of transcriptional stimulation by each element when linked to the proximal U6 promoter. Multimers of either OCT or SPH did not increase transcriptional levels above that with a single copy, either in transfected human cells or after in vitro transcription in a HeLa S100 extract. The orientation of a single SPH element differentially stimulated transcription in transfected cells, whereas the orientation of an octamer element was not important. Using Sarkosyl to limit transcription to a single-round, we concluded that promoters containing either OCT or SPH elements supported an increased number of preinitiation complexes in vitro. Furthermore, the rate of formation of U6 promoter preinitiation complexes resistant to low (0.015%) concentrations of Sarkosyl was accelerated on templates containing either OCT or SPH. However, neither element had a significant effect on the number of rounds of reinitiation in the S100 extract.

TI  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis.  
AB  - The term histiocytosis identifies a group of disorders characterized by localized or generalized reactive or neoplastic proliferation of cells similar, if not identical, to cells of the mononuclear phagocyte and dendritic cell systems. In Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), the proliferating cell is the Langerhans cell, and the morphologic and immunohistochemical criteria for the definitive diagnosis of LCH have been established. The clinically evident pathology of LCH is broadly divided into two categories: direct involvement with the disease (e.g., lytic lesions of the bone or organ involvement) and secondary consequences resulting from permanent damage by the primary disease, LCH (eg, diabetes insipidus, fractures, and tooth loss). Current knowledge suggests tailoring the therapy to the extent of disease.  Single-system disease can be treated by excisional biopsy, low-dose radiotherapy, or mild chemotherapy. Multisystem disease should be treated with combination chemotherapy, and current experimental therapeutic approaches include randomized treatment protocols for multisystem disease. A pressing current controversy regarding LCH is that its etiology is unknown. Whether LCH is reactive or neoplastic is even debated, and several features provide seemingly contradictory evidence on this point (spontaneous resolution of disease on one hand and clonality of lesional LCH cells on the other), underscoring the need for further studies to elucidate the etiology and pathogenesis of LCH.

AB  - The inhibitory effects of 12-O-tetradeconylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the Lucifer Yellow leakage in single (nondissociated and dissociated) Novikoff cells in the presence of ethyleneglycotetraacetic acid (EGTA) and transfer between reaggregated cell pairs were investigated. Under treatment with TPA, single Novikoff cells showed inhibition of the dye leakage in the presence of EGTA, especially after 60-min treatment. There were only slight differences between nondissociated and dissociated cells in these experiments. The dye transfer in reaggregated cell pairs were significantly inhibited after 30-min treatment with TPA. In pretreatment with TPA during the recovery period of reaggregation the dye transfer in cell pairs was completely blocked. It was suggested that TPA blocks the assembly of gap junction, while it had no remarkable effect on gating mechanism of the hemichannels.

TI  - Risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is independent of site and rate of administration.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Two studies were conducted to compare the absorption of risedronate administered as a solution to three different gastrointestinal sites (study A) and to determine the extent of absorption of risedronate solution administered by rapid and slow infusion to the second part of the duodenum (study B). METHODS: Each study was designed as a single-dose, crossover (three periods, study A; two periods, study B) trial in healthy male subjects, with a 14-day washout period between dosing. Subjects fasted overnight before drug administration and for 4 hours after drug administration. In study A, a risedronate solution of 40 mg in 30 mL of water was administered directly into the stomach, the second part of the duodenum, or the terminal ileum over 1 minute via a nasoenteral tube in a three-period crossover design. In study B, a risedronate solution of 40 mg in 30 mL of water was administered directly into the second part of the duodenum over 1 minute and over 1 hour in a randomized, two-period crossover design. Serum and urine samples were obtained for 48 hours after dosing for risedronate analysis. RESULTS: Eight subjects completed each study. No statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed (study A). Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion (study B). Only minor symptomatic complaints were reported by subjects, such as headaches and body aches. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.

TI  - Localization of spatial attention processes with the aid of a probe technique.  
AB  - A sudden visual onset is thought to 'attract attention to its location' within less than 100 ms. We attempted to measure the effect of this attentional process on the event-related potential (ERP) to a probe presented about 140 ms after the onset, and to delineate the spatiotemporal characteristics of such an effect, if any. ERPs were recorded from 30 channels from 6 subjects while they performed a target detection task. Both targets and probes could be located in each of the 4 quadrants (eccentricities 6.1 degrees and 7 degrees, respectively).  For a given single target, the subsequent probe was either presented near the location of the target ('valid target') or at the diagonal opposite ('invalid target'). Appropriate 'neutral' conditions (probes preceded by no target, or by simultaneous targets in all quadrants) were applied, and ERPs to probes were corrected for the contribution of the ERPs to targets. The earliest effect of (in)validity was found at about 120 ms after probe onset for lower field probes. This effect consisted of enhanced posterior positivity for valid relative to neutral relative to invalid conditions. This positivity was superposed on a contralateral, extrastriate negative ongoing wave peaking at about 150 ms ('N150'). Source localization suggested that the (in)validity effects originate from deep medial parietal areas. The source corresponding to the N150 activity was not influenced by (in)validity. An earlier deflection to the probe at 80 ms ('NP80') depended on location, but not on (in)validity, and seemed to be of striate origin. Results are discussed in terms of a model postulating an attention-independent 'input module' from which activation is fed to a 'location module' embodying the actual attention mechanism.

TI  - Analytical aspects of population-specific DNA fingerprinting for individuals.  
AB  - An emerging problem of some interest is whether we can determine the population membership of a single individual, using a population-specific "genetic fingerprint." The levels of accuracy and precision required are beyond the reach of allozyme analysis, and attention has shifted to DNA polymorphisms. There are different types of DNA markers available for population surveys: RFLPs, mini- and micro-satellites, and RAPDs, and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. We present a generic analysis that relates gene pool separation to our ability to assign individuals, an analysis that does not depend on the type of marker. We then review strengths and weaknesses of different DNA markers, in the context of DNA fingerprinting. Codominant loci are best. It is possible to gain more information per marker with multiallelic loci, but diminishing returns set in rapidly, and it is better to add loci. A modest number of independent loci is best, each locus with a modest number of alleles and with each allele in modest frequency.

TI  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a report of 12 patients from a single institution [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stem-cell transplantation is a reasonable therapeutic approach for younger patients with high-risk CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients (seven males; median age 47 years, range 29-51) with high-risk CLL underwent transplantation (allo, n = 7; auto, n = 5). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation in 11 patients, and BEAC in the remaining one. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by cytofluorometry and PCR. RESULTS: All 11 evaluable patients engrafted. Of the seven allografted patients, two died of treatment-related causes; three patients developed acute GVHD. No transplant-related mortality was observed in autografted patients. After transplantation, 10 of 11 patients evaluable for response achieved CR (91%; 95% CI 59%-100%) which was molecular in nine patients (82%; 95% CI 48%-98%). One patient in CR but MRD+ relapsed nine months after transplantation and died. Seven patients remain in molecular CR for a median of 16 months (range 1-58). Estimated actuarial survival and disease-free survival at two years is 81% (95% CI 43%-100%) and 71% (95% CI 43%-99%), respectively. Relapse risk at two years is 12.5% (95% CI 0%-35.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high-risk CLL can achieve long-lasting molecular CR after SCT. The role of transplants in CLL management deserves investigation in controlled trials.

TI  - Expiratory phase and volume-adjusted tracheal gas insufflation: a lung model study [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in a lung model the effects of expiratory-phase tracheal gas insufflation (expiratory-phase TGI) with both volume and pressure control ventilation, and tidal volume-adjusted continuous flow TGI (volume-adjusted TGI) on system pressures and volumes. DESIGN: Single-compartment lung model. SETTING: Research laboratory in a university medical center. INTERVENTIONS: Expiratory-phase TGI was established, using a solenoid valve activated by the ventilator. Volume-adjusted TGI was applied by reducing tidal volume (VT) by the product of TGI flow and inspiratory time. Ventilation was provided with pressure control of 20 cm H2O or volume control ventilation with VT similar to that with pressure control ventilation. A rate of 15 breaths/min and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O were used throughout. Inspiratory time periods of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 secs were used with TGI flows of 0, 4, 8, and 12 L/min. Lung model compliance (mL/cm H2O) and resistance (cm H2O/L/sec) combinations of 20/20, 20/5, and 50/20 were used. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In expiratory-phase TGI with pressure control ventilation, peak alveolar pressure remained constant, PEEP increased (p < .01) and VT decreased (p < .01). In expiratory-phase TGI with volume control ventilation and volume-adjusted TGI, there were significant increases in peak alveolar pressure and PEEP (p < .01). Readjustment of VT in volume-adjusted TGI was impossible with longer inspiratory time (> or = 2 secs) and higher TGI flows (> or = 8 L/min). CONCLUSIONS: The marked increases in system pressures and volumes observed with continuous-flow TGI can be avoided with expiratory-phase TGI and volume-adjusted TGI.

TI  - Secular changes in standards of bodily attractiveness in women: tests of a reproductive model.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since success at work is favored by a more slender body build while reproduction is favored by curvaceousness, standards of women's bodily attractiveness should be predictable from economic and reproductive variables. METHODS: This hypothesis was tested in a replication and extension of a study by Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, Vogel, and Fantini (1986) which looked at correlates of curvaceousness of Vogue models over time. RESULTS: As economic prosperity increased, and as women's participation in the economy, and higher education, increased, curvaceousness of the standards declined. As the proportion of single women to men, both aged 20-24 years, increased, and as the birth rate declined, curvaceousness was reduced. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that cultural standards of attractiveness are influenced by an evolved psychology of mate selection.

TI  - Regeneration of periodontal ligament and cementum by BMP-applied tissue engineering.  
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that the inductive properties of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) highly depend on the nature of the carrier material used for implantation. In this paper, we show that administration of BMP incorporated in a fibrous collagen membrane can help to regenerate periodontal ligament and cementum both in cat canines and in monkey molars. The partially purified bovine BMP was combined with one or two layers of a fibrous collagen membrane. Although the single layer approach showed partial regeneration of periodontal defects, it also quite often led to ankylosis. The double layer technique in artificially prepared class III furcation defects in monkey molars gave favorable results. After 12 wk, not only the alveolar process but also the periodontal ligament and cementum had regenerated along the entire treated dentin surface. Collagen fibers were arranged more or less perpendicular to the surface of the new cementum. Ankylosis was not seen. It is concluded that the double-layer approach is superior to the single-layer technique in regenerating cementum.

TI  - Influence of erythromycin pre- and co-treatment on single-dose pharmacokinetics of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerivastatin is a novel, synthetic, highly potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at very low doses. It is exclusively cleared from humans via cytochrome P450-mediated biotransformation (demethylation M1; hydroxylation M23) and subsequent biliary/renal excretion of the metabolites. The influence of concomitant administration of erythromycin, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on cerivastatin bioavailability and pharmacokinetics was investigated. METHODS: Twelve healthy young male subjects received single oral doses of 300 microg cerivastatin alone or on the 4th day of a 4-day pre- and co-treatment with erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. in a randomised, non-blind crossover study. Plasma and urine samples were analysed for cerivastatin and its major metabolites by validated specific high-performance liquid chromatography assays. RESULTS: Cerivastatin was safe and well tolerated. No clinically relevant treatment-emergent changes in laboratory parameters were observed. The pre- and co-treatment with erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. had a modest influence on cerivastatin clearance, leading to a mean increase in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 13% and a slightly increased terminal half-life (approximately 10%), resulting in a mean elevation of the area under the curve (AUC) of 21%; time to peak (tmax) remained unchanged. While the mean AUC of the metabolite M1 following the combined dosing was decreased by 60% compared with mono-dosing, the mean AUC of M23 exhibited an increase of approximately 60%. The respective Cmax results paralleled these pronounced effects, whereas the influence on mean terminal half-lives was small (i.e. for M23, an approximate 20% increase) or not observable (i.e. for M1). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of erythromycin 500 mg t.i.d. affects, to a certain extent, the metabolism of cerivastatin, administered as a single oral dose of 300 microg, resulting in a slightly increased exposure of the parent drug and active metabolites which, however, does not need dose adjustment. In addition, the small increase in cerivastatin half-life does not predict an accumulation beyond steady state. The pharmacokinetic data for the major metabolites suggest that the M1 metabolic pathway is more sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition than the parallel M23 pathway, supporting recent in vitro findings that further cytochrome P450 isozymes are differently involved in the metabolic pathways of cerivastatin.

TI  - Differential signaling via the same axon of neocortical pyramidal neurons.  
AB  - The nature of information stemming from a single neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different pre-postsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supra-linear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.

TI  - Modulation of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channel by the nitromethylene heterocycle imidacloprid.  
AB  - Nitromethylene heterocycle insecticides are known to act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channel. The effects of the nitromethylene heterocycle, imidacloprid, on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channel of clonal rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells were studied using whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp methods. Imidacloprid suppressed carbachol-induced whole-cell currents in a dose-dependent manner, and this compound itself generated small currents. Multiple conductance states of single-channel currents were also evoked by imidacloprid at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channels. The most frequently generated single-channel currents showed two conductance states, 25.4 and 9.8 pS, which were identical to the conductance states of acetylcholine-generated currents. The mean open time and burst duration of the main conductance currents induced by imidacloprid were shorter than those induced by acetylcholine. Co-application of imidacloprid and acetylcholine caused some interactions at the two conductance states. Mean open time and mean burst duration of the main conductance state currents evoked by acetylcholine were decreased by the co-application of imidacloprid as compared with those induced by acetylcholine alone. In conclusion, imidacloprid has both multiple agonist and antagonist effects on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-channels.

TI  - Advances in drug treatment of dyslipidemia: focus on atorvastatin.  
AB  - The focus of lipid-lowering therapy with drugs is prevention of complications of atherosclerosis. Landmark clinical trials have demonstrated that lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may not only reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) risk but also may slow the progression and even induce regression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In addition, much attention has been given in recent years to the importance of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) as a CAD risk factor, and the benefit of reducing plasma triglyceride levels and raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels to prevent the recurrence of coronary events. Lipid-lowering drugs should be used within the framework of a systematic approach to treatment. Consideration must be given to the lipoprotein abnormality, the severity of disease, the role of combination therapy, and the spectrum of action of the drug and its pleiotropic effects (ie, effects beyond the expected action on lipoproteins). Five major agents have been used for the treatment of dyslipidemias. Three (resins, probucol and statins) target LDL-C, and two (fibrates and niacin) target primarily TRL and HDL-C. Fibrates and statins are the drugs of choice. Fibrates correct many abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism in addition to having beneficial pleiotropic effects such as reducing fibrinogen and plasma viscosity. They inhibit the transcription of apolipoprotein (apo) CIII and enhance that of apoAI and lipoprotein lipase. Statins are safe and potent drugs for reducing LDL-C levels, and their efficacy in primary and secondary prevention of CAD has been amply demonstrated. They share a modes effect of raising HDL-C levels. Their pleiotropic effects, which include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, are numerous and may contribute to their spectacular beneficial effect of reducing CAD risk. They have effects that are complementary to those of fibrates, but the two drugs should be combined with caution because of the danger of myopathy. Atorvastatin is a major addition to this class of drugs because of its high efficacy and large spectrum of action. It lowers LDL-C levels effectively, not only in patients with severe forms of hypercholesterolemia but also in those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C may be further enhanced by combining it with a resin. The ability of atorvastatin to lower triglyceride levels as well as LDL-C levels indicates that combined hyperlipidemia, a condition that, in the past, was best controlled with combination therapy, can now be treated with a single drug. It is also effective in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and, although less potent than fenofibrate at reducing TRL and increasing HDL-C, it has a greater impact on the atherogenic risk ratios such as LDL-C:HDL-C. The profile of its pleiotropic effects is promising.

TI  - Retrograde flexible ureterorenoscopic holmium-YAG laser lithotripsy: the new gold standard.  
AB  - To demonstrate the efficacy of flexible retrograde ureterorenoscopic holmium-YAG intracorporeal laser lithotripsy for the treatment of renal calculi, a total of 86 patients presenting to our hospital with renal calculi underwent flexible retrograde ureterorenoscopic holmium-YAG intracorporeal laser lithotripsy of their stones, and the data were collected prospectively. As extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is not available at our institution, all patients with renal calculi in this study were treated in a retrograde fashion using the Richard Wolf 6.0F semirigid ureteroscope, the 7.5F flexible ureterorenoscope, and the holmium-YAG laser by Coherent Inc. Except for inhospital consults or patients requiring admission secondary to infection, all cases were performed on an ambulatory basis. All renal calculi 3 cm or smaller were approached in a retrograde fashion. Where possible, the stones were initially debulked using the semirigid ureteroscope and the 550-microm fiber followed by the flexible ureterorenoscope in combination with the 360- or 200-microm laser fiber depending on stone position. Stones were fragmented until they were small enough to be removed by hydrocleansing. Using this technique, stone-free success rates for calculi 2.5 cm or smaller after a single treatment, regardless of stone composition or location, are superior to those of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. For calculi between 2.5 and 3 cm, the results also are noted to be superior. We conclude that for calculi larger than 3 cm or for partial staghorn calculi, the treatment of choice appears to be a percutaneous approach.

TI  -  Single-beat analysis of ventricular late potentials in the surface electrocardiogram using the spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm in patients with coronary artery disease.  
AB  - AIMS: Post-infarction risk stratification can be ascertained from beat-to-beat variations in ventricular late potentials. However, gaining such information by conventional late potential analysis using signal averaging is still not possible. METHODS: We therefore developed the spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm in order to detect beat-to-beat variations in late potentials. Based on the spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm two-dimensional correlation function, the typical spectral pattern of late potentials can be identified in spectrotemporal maps of single beats, even in the presence of noise. RESULTS: Surface electrocardiograms of 385 patients after myocardial infarction (85 with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (group 1), 100 with fast, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (> 270 cycles.min-1) or primary ventricular fibrillation (group 2), 200 without ventricular arrhythmias (group 3) and 45 healthy volunteers (group 4), were analysed. The spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm detected late potentials in single beats in 89% of group 1 patients, in 79% of group 2, in 22% of group 3 and in 4% of normals. The spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm measured late potential frequency and extension of late potentials into the ST segment, which was significantly different between groups 1 and 2. Beat-to-beat variations in late potentials, with respect to frequency and extension into the ST segment, were markedly higher in patients with a history of primary ventricular fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Single-beat analysis using the spectrotemporal pattern recognition algorithm may improve risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction, and provides information on patients prone to ventricular fibrillation.

TI  - Possible causes of inconclusive results on CT-guided thoracic and abdominal core biopsies.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine possible technical causes of inconclusive results on CT-guided core biopsies of lesions suggestive of malignancy and to determine the frequency with which such lesions are eventually found to be malignant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 116 consecutive CT-guided thoracic and abdominal core biopsies performed with a 20-gauge automatic biopsy system. Biopsy results were conclusive (n = 94) if pathology confirmed malignancy and inconclusive (n = 22) if pathology results were negative for malignancy or were nondiagnostic. Lesion volume, location, number of cores, and biopsy technique (paraxial or coaxial) were compared for the conclusive and inconclusive biopsy results. Malignancy within the group of inconclusive biopsy results was determined from a second biopsy, radiographic follow-up, or surgery. RESULTS: Regression analysis identified only the biopsy method as a significant factor affecting biopsy outcome: The paraxial method was more likely to yield a conclusive result than the coaxial method (p < .002). For the two biopsy methods, lesions had similar volumes, locations, and numbers of cores obtained.  For single core biopsies, both methods were equivalent. However, if two or more cores were obtained, a conclusive result was achieved in more than 90% of biopsies with the paraxial method versus 65% for the coaxial method. On follow-up, results of 14 (64%) of 22 inconclusive biopsies were malignant, indicating an overall false-negative rate of 12%. CONCLUSION: CT-guided core biopsy performed with 20-gauge automatic biopsy systems and the paraxial method will yield conclusive results significantly more often than the coaxial method. In the event of inconclusive results, malignancy will exist often enough to warrant follow-up.

TI  - Temporal variability of asymptomatic embolization in carotid artery stenosis and optimal recording protocols.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although asymptomatic embolization can be detected in patients with carotid artery stenosis, its temporal variability is unclear. An understanding of this is important in designing optimal recording protocols for future prospective studies of the predictive value of embolic signals (ES). We determined the effect of repeating and extending recording times in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. METHODS: In 20 asymptomatic and 20 symptomatic subjects with > 60% carotid stenosis, we used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to record for ES in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. Three 1-hour recordings were performed on three separate days, and on one occasion (not necessarily the first) the recording was extended to 2 hours. The recordings were saved onto digital tape for subsequent blinded analysis. RESULTS: Marked temporal variability was seen in symptomatic patients in whom the cumulative proportion of subjects with ES increased from 10 (50%) after a single hour of recording to 12 (60%) and 15 (75%) after two and three recordings, respectively. Extending the recording to 2 hours increased the yield of ES-positive patients from 6 (30%) to 8 (40%). In symptomatic patients there was excellent agreement between whether patients were positive for ES during each of two consecutive 1-hour recordings (kappa = 0.78, P = 0.0003) but poor agreement between the results of two single-hour recordings performed on different days (kappa = 0.22, P = 0.27). In asymptomatic patients, 4 (20%) were ES positive during the first hour; this increased to 5 (25%) after the recording was repeated once, with no further increase after the third recording. Extending the recording to 2 hours increased the yield from 3 (15%) to 7 (35%). In contrast to symptomatic stenoses, in patients with asymptomatic stenoses there was fair agreement between whether patients were ES positive on two consecutive 1-hour recordings (kappa = 0.49, P = 0.01) or two single-hour recordings performed on different days (kappa = 0.48, P = 0.02). Symptomatic subjects were more likely to have ES (when all 1-hour recordings were considered, 24/60 versus 10/60; P = 0.0046). ES in symptomatic subjects had a higher relative intensity increase than in asymptomatic subjects (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The temporal variability of ES needs to be taken into account in the design of optimal recording protocols and comparisons of results from different studies. Extending the duration of recording beyond an hour in symptomatic stenoses is of less value, but repeating the recording on a different day will often identify additional subjects with ES. In intervention studies in symptomatic patients, the time since last symptoms must be considered. In asymptomatic stenosis, extending the duration of recording beyond an hour will increase the proportion of patients positive for ES.

TI  - An isoflavonoid-inducible efflux pump in Agrobacterium tumefaciens is involved in competitive colonization of roots.  
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens 1D1609, which was originally isolated from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), contains genes that increase competitive root colonization on that plant by reducing the accumulation of alfalfa isoflavonoids in the bacterial cells. Mutant strain I-1 was isolated by its isoflavonoid-inducible neomycin resistance following mutagenesis with the transposable promoter probe Tn5-B30. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed the transposon had inserted in the first open reading frame, ifeA, of a three-gene locus (ifeA, ifeB, and ifeR), which shows high homology to bacterial efflux pump operons. Assays on alfalfa showed that mutant strain I-1 colonized roots normally in single-strain tests but was impaired significantly (P < or = 0.01) in competition against wild-type strain 1D1609. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which produced strains I-4 (ifeA::gusA) and I-6 (ifeA::omega-Tc), confirmed the importance of ifeA for competitive root colonization. Exposure to the isoflavonoid coumestrol increased beta-glucuronidase activity in strain I-4 21-fold during the period when coumestrol accumulation in wild-type cells declined. In the same test, coumestrol accumulation in mutant strain I-6 did not decline. Expression of the ifeA-gusA reporter was also induced by the alfalfa root isoflavonoids formononetin and medicarpin but not by two triterpenoids present in alfalfa. These results show that an efflux pump can confer measurable ecological benefits on A. tumefaciens in an environment where the inducing molecules are known to be present.

TI  - Decreased N-acetylaspartate in motor cortex and corticospinal tract in ALS.  
AB  - The primary objectives of this study were to test whether 1) N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a neuronal marker, is reduced in motor cortex and corticospinal-tract (CST) brain regions of ALS patients; and 2) motor cortex NAA correlates to a clinical measurement of upper motor neuron function in ALS patients. Ten probable or definite ALS patients and nine neurologically normal control subjects were studied. Three axial planes of two-dimensional 1H MRSI data were collected, using a single spin-echo multislice sequence (TE140/TR2000). Two of the 1H MRSI planes were positioned superior to the lateral ventricles, and one plane was positioned at the level of the internal capsule. Spectroscopy voxels were selected from motor cortex, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, medial gray matter, centrum semiovale white matter, anterior internal capsule, and posterior internal capsule. Peak integrals were obtained for the three major 1H MRSI singlet resonances, NAA, creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and cholines (Cho). Maximum finger-tap rate was used as a clinical measurement of upper motor neuron function. In ALS, brain NAA/(Cho+Cr) was reduced 19% (p=0.024) in the motor cortex and 16% (p=0.021) in the CST (centrum semiovale and posterior internal capsule) regions. NAA/ (Cho+Cr) was not reduced in frontal cortex, parietal cortex, medial gray matter, or anterior internal capsule. There was a significant relation between ALS motor cortex NAA/(Cho+Cr) and maximum finger-tap rate (r=0.80; p=0.014). NAA/(Cho+Cr) was reduced in motor cortex and CST regions and unchanged in other brain regions of ALS patients when compared with controls. These findings are consistent with the known distribution of neuronal loss in ALS. The positive correlation between motor cortex NAA/(Cho+Cr) and maximum finger-tap rate suggests that reduced NAA/(Cho+Cr) is a surrogate marker of motor cortex neuron loss in ALS. These findings support the study of 1H MRSI NAA measurement as an objective and quantitative measurement of upper motor neuron dysfunction in ALS.

TI  - Use of DNA purification kits for polymerase chain reaction testing of Gen-Probe Chlamydia trachomatis PACE 2 specimens.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Confirmation testing using nucleic acid amplification has been shown to improve the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests for Chlamydia trachomatis. However, no critical information on the use of these techniques as an adjunct to Gen-Probe hybridization testing, one of the most common screening methods, has been reported to date. We examined the Roche AMPLICOR PCR C. trachomatis Test (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) as a confirmatory test for the Gen-Probe PACE 2 C. trachomatis Test (San Diego, CA). Further, to mitigate the possible effect of interfering compounds in the Gen-Probe PACE 2 transport medium, we tested various DNA purification techniques. STUDY DESIGN: C. trachomatis elementary bodies were used to spike PACE 2 Transport medium, which was serially diluted, then tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Six parallel dilution series were conducted: (1) saline dilutions tested by the Syva Direct Specimen Test, (2) Roche AMPLICOR transport medium dilutions tested by PCR, and (3-6) dilutions in PACE 2 transport medium purified respectively by GENECLEAN II (BIO101, Vista, CA), Puregene (Gentra Systems, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC), Microcon 100 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) DNA isolation kits, and no DNA purification, all tested by PCR. The system giving the best results by in vitro endpoint dilution trials was then used to confirm human specimens previously tested by the Gen-Probe method. RESULTS: PCR detected C. trachomatis at 11 twofold dilutions greater than PACE 2 and equivalent to detection of single elementary body by Syva Direct Specimen Test. DNA purification of spiked PACE 2 transport medium by the Microcon 100 kit produced the most consistent PCR detection endpoints, equivalent to endpoints of spiked AMPLICOR transport medium. Endpoints with no DNA purification step were variable and lower. Of 78 endocervical specimens negative by PACE 2 and Gen-Probe Probe Competition Assay, 12 (15.3%) were positive by Microcon DNA purification/PCR testing. CONCLUSIONS: PCR can be used as confirmation method for Gen-Probe PACE 2 testing, but testing must be performed with a DNA purification procedure.

The recipient yeast used was deficient in the major AP endonuclease (apn1). Sequence analysis of the transformants suggested that dATP was incorporated most frequently opposite the abasic site, while dGTP seemed to be incorporated opposite the abasic site in the recipient proficient in apn1. To explore the mechanism of this oligonucleotide transformation, we have also analyzed the transformation with phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with mismatched 3'-end. The results are discussed.

TI  - Dynamical behavior of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein.  
AB  - The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) contains two CCHC-type zinc knuckle domains that are essential for genome recognition, packaging and infectivity. The solution structure of the protein has been determined independently by three groups. Although the structures of the individual zinc knuckle domains are similar, two of the studies indicated that the knuckles behave as independently folded, non-interacting domains connected by a flexible tether, whereas one study revealed the presence of interknuckle NOE cross-peaks, which were interpreted in terms of a more compact structure in which the knuckles are in close proximity. We have collected multidimensional NMR data for the recombinant, isotopically labeled HIV-1 NC protein, and confirmed the presence of weak interknuckle NOEs. However, the NOE data are not consistent with a single protein conformation. 15N NMR relaxation studies reveal that the two zinc knuckle domains possess different effective rotational correlation times, indicating that the knuckles are not tumbling as a single globular domain. In addition, the 1H NMR chemical shifts of isolated zinc knuckle peptides are very similar to those of the intact protein. The combined results indicate that the interknuckle interactions, which involve the close approach of the side-chains of Phe16 and Trp37, are transitory. The solution behavior of NC may be best considered as a rapid equilibrium between conformations with weakly interacting and non-interacting knuckle domains. This inherent conformational flexibility may be functionally important, enabling adaptive binding of NC to different recognition elements within the HIV-1 psi-RNA packaging signal.

AB  - As part of an ongoing comparative fine structural study, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choriocapillaris and complexus basalis (Bruch's membrane) in the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) have been investigated by light and electron microscopy. The RPE consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells joined basally by a series of tight junctions. Basally (sclerally) the RPE cells display numerous deep infoldings while apically (vitreally) plentiful microvillar processes interdigitate with the photoreceptor outer segments. Internally the epithelial cells show a large vesicular nucleus, plentiful smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and numerous polysomes, but very little rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Numerous pleomorphic mitochondria are predominantly basally located. In the light-adapted specimens studied, the melanosomes of the RPE are almost exclusively located within the apical processes of these cells. Phagosomes and lysosome-like bodies are also present, as are myeloid bodies which often display ribosomes on their outer surface. Bruch's membrane (complexus basalis) is typical of avian species in that it is pentalaminate and the central lamina densa is displaced towards the choriocapillaris. The choricocapillaris endothelium is attenuated but only minimally fenestrated facing Bruch's membrane. Most of these fenestrations show a single-layered diaphragm but fenestrations with a double-layered diaphragm are not uncommon.

TI  - Construction of mono- and bivalent human single-chain Fv fragments against the D antigen in the Rh blood group: multimerization effect on cell agglutination and application to blood typing.  
AB  - An expression system for mono- and bivalent single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) of a human antibody against D antigen in the Rh blood group system was established in Escherichia coli. The cDNA encoding the Fv fragment of the anti-D monoclonal antibody D10 was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction and expressed in E.coli by fusing with a peptide tag link in the C-terminus of the light chain variable region. The scFv fragment expressed by the bacteria produced specific agglutination of human D positive red cells in the presence of an anti-peptide tag antibody. Flow cytometric analysis clearly indicated that the bacterially prepared scFv showed high specificity and affinity for D antigen, which was identical with that of the parental IgG. In order to construct bivalent D10 scFv for use in direct cell agglutination, the scFv was fused with a dimeric protein, bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP). The fusion protein produced significant agglutination of human red blood cells with D antigen, confirming that the bacterially expressed fusion protein is a functional bivalent antibody fragment. Specific agglutination of D positive red cells by D10 scFv-BAP was enhanced in the presence of anti-BAP antibody, suggesting that further multimerization of scFv led to highly efficient cell agglutination. By grafting BAP enzymatic activity into the scFv fragment (enzyme-linked scFv), blood typing could conveniently be performed. These results indicate that bacterially expressed scFv and scFv-BAP would be of practical use in blood typing. The system reported here could also be applied to the examination of other cell surface antigens and cell agglutination.

First, no single prefabricated post-and-core system fits all situations. Second, the vast number of post-and-core components currently on the market complicates the selection process. Finally, useful biomechanical criteria for evaluating prefabricated post-and-core components are difficult to quantify. The prefabricated post-and-core system consists of three components: the post, a core material, and a luting cement. Each combination of component types is a potential system alternative. This article presents useful biomechanical criteria, based on current restorative guidelines, for evaluating the basic components of any prefabricated post-and-core system.

To study the biological significance of the mutation, we introduced this mutation into a transformation-defective derivative of the molecularly cloned Rous sarcoma virus, SRA2, and examined its effect on virus replication. The virus possessing the mutation in its gag p19 gene had 50% slower replication as measured by the amount of reverse transcriptase as well as gag p27 protein (CA) in the culture media. Glu at position 126 appears to be important for efficient production of Rous sarcoma virus in vitro.

TI  - Mobility of cell surface receptors: a re-evaluation.  
AB  - It has long been known from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments that the mobility of most cell surface receptors is much smaller than expected for free diffusion of proteins in a fluid lipid bilayer.  Single-particle tracking experiments are currently revealing the complexity of the constraints to free diffusion. Evidence has been obtained for several different processes: domain-limited diffusion, temporary confinement and anomalous diffusion. The type of motion exhibited by a given receptor will profoundly influence the rate of any functional process which requires movement in the plane of the membrane. In particular, anomalous diffusion greatly reduces the distance travelled by a receptor on a time scale of minutes.

TI  - Segregation analysis of cutaneous melanoma in Queensland.  
AB  - To investigate whether the familial clustering of cutaneous melanoma is consistent with Mendelian inheritance of a major autosomal gene, maximum likelihood segregation analyses were performed in a population-based sample of 1,912 families ascertained through a proband with melanoma diagnosed in Queensland between 1982 and 1990. Analyses were performed with the S.A.G.E. statistical package, using the REGTL program for a binary trait with a variable age of onset. We sought medical confirmation for all family members reported to have had melanoma, and only medically verified cases among relatives were included in the analyses. The hypothesis of codominant Mendelian inheritance gave a significantly better fit to the data than either dominant or recessive Mendelian inheritance, or environmental transmission. Overall, both Mendelian inheritance of a single major gene, and purely environmental transmission were rejected (P < 0.001). In both the single major gene and environmental models, there was strong evidence of familial dependence in melanoma occurrence (P < 0.001). These results are consistent with reported genetic heterogeneity in melanoma inheritance and suggest that other familial factors, such as pigmentation, skin type, and sun exposure habits, may play an important role in the familial clustering of melanoma.

TI  - Sequence-specific binding of Ku autoantigen to single-stranded DNA.  
AB  - Glucocorticoid-induced transcription of mouse mammary tumor virus is repressed by Ku antigen/DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) through a DNA sequence element (NRE1) in the viral long terminal repeat. Nuclear factors binding to the separated single strands of NRE1 have been identified that may also be important for transcriptional regulation through this element. We report the separation of the upper-stranded NRE1 binding activity in Jurkat T cell nuclear extracts into two components. One component was identified as Ku antigen. The DNA sequence preference for Ku binding to single-stranded DNA closely paralleled the sequence requirements of Ku for double-stranded DNA. Recombinant Ku bound the single, upper strand of NRE1 with an affinity that was 3-4-fold lower than its affinity for double-stranded NRE1. Sequence-specific single-stranded Ku binding occurred rapidly (t1/2 on = 2.0 min) and was exceptionally stable, with an off rate of t1/2= 68 min. While Ku70 cross-linked to the upper strand of NRE1 when Ku was bound to double-stranded and single-stranded DNAs, the Ku80 subunit only cross-linked to single-stranded NRE1. Intriguingly, addition of Mg2+ and ATP, the cofactors required for Ku helicase activity, induced the cross-linking of Ku80 to a double-stranded NRE1-containing oligonucleotide, without completely unwinding the two strands.

TI  - Stability of Le Fort I osteotomy with advancement: a comparison of single maxillary surgery and a two-jaw procedure.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared single maxillary surgery and a two-jaw procedure in patients who underwent one-piece Le Fort I advancement without bone grafting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients had Le Fort I osteotomy performed using a standard technique. Twenty-two patients had maxillary surgery alone, and 31 patients additionally had a bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy performed. Both rigid and nonrigid fixation were used. The postoperative movement of the maxilla was investigated, comparing cephalograms taken preoperatively, 2 to 3 days postoperatively, and at least 6 months postoperatively. A computer program was used to superimpose the three radiographs. RESULTS: No difference in postoperative stability was found when the two surgical procedures were compared, and no correlation between magnitude of advancement and degree of relapse could be identified (P > .05). Nonrigid fixation in patients receiving only maxillary surgery resulted in greater postoperative forward movement of the maxilla (P = .022). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that postoperative stability of the maxilla in a two-jaw procedure is equivalent to that of single maxillary surgery. Nonrigid fixation in single maxillary surgery reduces the need for postoperative orthodontics.

TI  - A single amino acid change in the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of thyroglobulin causes congenital goiter with hypothyroidism in the cog/cog mouse: a model of human endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases.  
AB  - Newly synthesized thyroglobulin (Tg), the major secretory glycoprotein of the thyroid gland, folds and homodimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before its export to the site of iodination, where it serves as the precursor for thyroid hormone synthesis. In families with defective Tg export, affected individuals suffer from a thyroidal ER storage disease characterized by a distended thyrocyte ER containing misfolded Tg, along with induced ER molecular chaperones. Inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, deficient Tg causes congenital hypothyroidism in newborns that, if untreated, results in goiter along with serious cognitive and growth defects. Recently, a similar phenotype has been observed in inbred cog/cog mice, although the precise molecular defect has remained undefined. Here, we have isolated and cloned a full-length 8.5-kb Tg cDNA from cog/cog mice and unaffected isogenic AKR/J mice. Comparison of the complete sequences reveals that cog/cog mice express a Leu-2263 --> Pro missense mutation in the acetylcholinesterase-homology domain of Tg. Heterologous expression studies in COS cells indicate that cog Tg exhibits a severe defect in exit from the ER. Site-directed mutagenesis of cog Tg to convert the single amino acid back to Leu-2263 restores normal Tg secretion. We conclude that the cog mutation in Tg is responsible for this ER storage disease that causes thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of patients with hairy cell leukemia after cladribine treatment.  
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia is a chronic B-cell disorder that follows an indolent, but progressive course. Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) induces complete remissions in the majority of patients after a single course. We report the long-term outcomes, including response rates and their duration; time-to-treatment failure (TTF) rates; retreatment results; toxicities; and survival rates of patients treated at Scripps Clinic (La Jolla, CA). A total of 358 patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with cladribine at 0.087 or 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days. The expected number of second neoplasms was based on the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data. Of 349 evaluable patients, 319 (91%) achieved an initial complete response and 22 (7%) a partial response with an overall median duration of response follow-up of 52 months. Ninety patients (26%) had relapsed at a median of 29 months. The TTF rate for all 341 responders was 19% at 48 months, 16% for complete responders, and 54% for partial responders. Of 53 evaluable patients treated with second courses of cladribine at first relapse, 33 (62%) achieved complete responses and 14 (26%) partial responses. Twenty-seven patients (8%) developed second neoplasms (only 1 hematopoietic) with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 2.74). The overall survival rate was 96% at 48 months. Single courses of cladribine induced long-lasting complete responses in the vast majority of patients. Relapse rates for complete responders were low. Patients who relapse can be successfully retreated with cladribine. Cladribine has high efficacy and a favorable acute and long-term toxicity profile when administered to patients with hairy cell leukemia. Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.

TI  - Comparison of the current WHO and new ADA criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in three ethnic groups in the UK. American Diabetes Association [see comments]  
AB  - The American Diabetes Association have recommended that the fasting plasma glucose level for the diagnosis of diabetes is lowered and that this becomes the main diagnostic test. We have used population-based data from three ethnic groups in Newcastle upon Tyne to examine the implications of this change. Data were available on 824 European (25-74 years), 375 Chinese (25-64 years), and 680 South Asian (25-74 years) subjects. All subjects apart from those reporting a prior diagnosis of diabetes underwent a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (WHO criteria) which included the measurement of fasting glucose. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in all three ethnic groups using the new ADA criteria compared to the WHO criteria: 7.1% vs 4.8% in Europeans; 6.2% vs 4.7% in Chinese; and 21.4% vs 20.1% in South Asians. There was much variation in individuals categorized by the ADA and WHO criteria. Agreement between the two for the diagnosis of previously unknown diabetes was only moderate (kappa statistics 0.42 to 0.59). Thus in the populations studied the new criteria would increase the prevalence of diabetes in addition to classifying some individuals diabetic by current criteria as non-diabetic. It should be stressed however that diagnosis of the individual should not be based on a single test.

TI  - Split tolerance to a viral antigen expressed in thymic epithelium and keratinocytes.  
AB  - When expressed as a transgene from the keratin 14 (K14) promoter in an MHC class II-deficient mouse, I-Ab expressed in thymic cortical epithelium promotes positive but not negative selection of I-Ab-restricted CD4+ T cells (Laufer, T. M. et al., Nature 1996. 383:81-85). Transgenic mice expressing the E7 protein of human papilloma virus 16 from the K14 promoter were studied to determine the consequence of expression of a cytoplasmic/ nuclear protein from the K14 promoter. K14E7-transgenic mice express E7 in the thymus and skin without evidence for autoimmunity to E7. Repeated immunization of FVB(H-2q) or F1(C57BL/6JxFVB) mice with E7 elicited similar antibody responses to the defined B cell epitopes of E7 in K14E7-transgenic and non-transgenic animals. In contrast, for each genetic background, a single immunization with E7 elicited demonstrable T cell proliferative responses to the major promiscuous T helper epitope of E7 in the transgenic but not the non-transgenic animals. Further, E7-immunized non-transgenic F1 (FVBxC57BL/6J) animals developed strong E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and were protected against challenge with E7+ tumors, whereas similarly immunized K14E7-transgenic animals had a markedly reduced CTL response to E7 and no E7-specific tumor protection was observed, although the antibody and CTL response to ovalbumin was normal. Expression of E7 protein as a transgene from the K14 promoter in the skin and thymus thus induces E7-specific tolerance in the cytotoxic T effector repertoire, together with expansion of the E7-specific T helper repertoire. These findings demonstrate that limited tissue distribution of an autoantigen may result in "split" tolerance to that autoantigen.

TI  - Reactive hyperemic response of the brachial artery: comparison of proximal and distal occlusion.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors compared the postocclusion hyperemic responses of the brachial artery after occluding blood flow proximal to and distal to the studied area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Response of the brachial artery to hypoxia was evaluated with duplex Doppler ultrasound in 13 healthy subjects. A pneumatic tourniquet was first positioned 2-5 cm superior to the left elbow, proximal to the area of artery studied. Two hours later the response was remeasured with the tourniquet positioned 2-5 cm inferior to the elbow, distal to the artery studied. Arterial diameter, mean and peak flow velocities, and heart rate were assessed. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between measurements of baseline and postischemic arterial diameter, percentage diameter change, baseline mean arterial blood flow velocity, baseline peak arterial blood flow velocity, or postischemic heart rate obtained with proximal occlusion of the artery and those obtained with distal occlusion. In contrast, mean and peak postischemic arterial blood flow velocity and preocclusion heart rate were higher in measurements made during proximal artery occlusion. Significant correlation was found between measurements of percentage change in artery diameter obtained with proximal artery occlusion and those obtained with distal occlusion (r = 0.611, P < .05). CONCLUSION: There are no major differences in postischemic changes in brachial artery diameter related to reactive hyperemia between blood flow occlusion applied proximal and distal to the studied area. However, there are significant differences in the mean and peak systolic velocities. Either occlusion site can be used for clinical studies if arterial diameter change is monitored, but if velocity measurements are being compared, a single occlusion site should be chosen.

TI  - Superantigen-targeted therapy: phase I escalating repeat dose trial of the fusion protein PNU-214565 in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies.  
AB  - Antibody-directed, superantigen-induced cytotoxicity has been shown to have potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects in preclinical models. In the present study, PNU-214565, a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the Fab of the monoclonal antibody C242 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), was used in an escalating repeat dose Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies. A prior single-dose Phase I clinical trial had demonstrated safety at doses of 1.5 ng/kg with toxicities of fever and hypotension that were not dose related. Twenty-seven patients (age range, 36-75 years; median, 62; 14 males and 13 females; 23 colorectal and 4 pancreatic) were treated in the present study with one cycle of four consecutive daily 3-h infusions of PNU-214565 at doses of 0.15 ng/kg (n = 3); 0.5 ng/kg (n = 3), 1.5 ng/kg (n = 4), 2.75 ng/kg (n = 12), and 3.5 ng/kg (n = 5). All patients had a good performance status [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group: PS = 0 (n = 15), PS = 1 (n = 12)]. As in the single-dose trial, fever and hypotension were the most common toxicities. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), consisting of transient hypotension responsive to dopamine, was experienced by one patient treated at the 2.75 ng/kg dose level. One patient with pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver experienced a partial response of hepatic metastases with stable pancreatic head abnormalities by computed tomography scan. Further dose escalation was suspended when two patients treated in a companion repeat dose Phase I study experienced DLT at the 4 ng/kg dose level. Multiparameter analyses on all patients treated in the two companion single-dose and two-repeated-dose Phase I trials revealed that the levels of patients' pretreatment anti-SEA antibodies protected against toxicity at a given drug dose. By jointly considering weight and the baseline anti-SEA concentration in a patient, it is possible to assign a PNU-214565 dose that will induce systemic cytokine release (a surrogate test to assess for the presence of uncomplexed drug and its ability to induce systemic cellular activation) without DLT. This pharmacodynamically based dosing scheme will be tested in future repeated-dose clinical trials and will define maximally tolerated doses of this powerful new immunotherapy approach.

TI  - Current surgical management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a report from the Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has changed from an emergent procedure to a delayed procedure in the last decade. Many other aspects of management have also evolved since the first successful repair. However, most reports are from single institutions. The lack of a large multicenter database has hampered progress in the management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and makes determination of the current standard difficult. METHODS: The CDH study group was formed in 1995 to collect data from multiple institutions in North America, Europe, and Australia. Participating centers completed a registry form on all live-born infants with CDH during 1995 and 1996. Demographic information, data about surgical management, and outcome were collected for all patients. RESULTS: Sixty-two centers participated, with 461 patients entered. Overall survival was 280 of 442 patients (63%) where survival was recorded. The defect was left-sided in 78%, right-sided in 21%, and bilateral in 1%. A subcostal approach was used in 91% of patients, with pleural drainage used in 76%. A patch of some kind was used in just over half (51%) of the patients, with polytetrafluoroethylene being the most commonly used material (81%) in those patients with a patch. The mean surgical time was 102 minutes, with an average blood loss of 14 mL (range, 0 to 500 mL). The overwhelming majority of patients underwent repair between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM (289 of 329, 88%). Nineteen percent of patients had surgical repair on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at a mean time of 170 hours into the ECMO course (range, 10 to 593 hours). The mean age at surgery in patients not treated with ECMO was 73 hours (range, 1 to 445 hours). CONCLUSIONS: The multicenter nature of this report makes it a snapshot of current management. The data would indicate that prosthetic patching of the defect has become common, that after-hours repair is infrequent, and that delayed surgical repair has become the preferred approach in many centers. Furthermore, the mean survival rate of 63% indicates that despite decades of individual effort, the CDH problem is far from solved. This highlights the need for a centralized database and cooperative multicenter studies in the future.

TI  - Acute tolerance associated with a single opiate administration: involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent pain facilitatory systems.  
AB  - Mechanisms underlying the development of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates were investigated. In the rat tail-flick test, administration of naloxone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) 40 min after heroin (1 mg/kg, s.c.) was shown to induce hyperalgesia, indicative of a short-onset, opiate-activated pain facilitatory systems masking the opiate analgesia. Pretreatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the naloxone-induced hyperalgesia and potentiated the heroin-induced analgesia. Using a schedule of two successive injections of 1 mg/kg heroin, acute tolerance was indicated by a marked reduction (-52%) in analgesia induced by the second dose. After pretreatment with dizocilpine maleate, the acute tolerance was abolished and the analgesic effects of both injections of heroin were strongly potentiated. These observations indicate that acute tolerance appears after the first exposure to opiates and stems from opiate activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent pain facilitatory systems.

TI  - Effect of single mutations on the structural dynamics of a DNA repair enzyme, the Escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase--a fluorescence study using tryptophan residues as reporter groups.  
AB  - The effects on the structure dynamics of the Escherichia coli wild-type formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) protein of the single mutations Lys57-->Gly (FpgK57G), Pro2-->Gly (FpgP2G) and Pro2-->Glu (FpgP2E) were studied by fluorescence techniques, namely: lifetime measurements and acrylamide quenching of the fluorescence of Trp residues. The fluorescence decays of Fpg and its mutant forms were analysed by the maximum-entropy method and lifetime distributions in the range 200 ps to 9 ns were obtained. The lifetime distribution profiles of FpgK57G, FpgP2G and FpgP2E are different from that of wild-type Fpg. Both dynamic and static quenching by acrylamide were observed for all the proteins. At 20 degrees C, the bimolecular collisional quenching rate constant of the FpgP2E fluorescence by acrylamide was only 0.8 M(-1) s(-1) as compared to about 1.4 M(-1) s(-1) for the three other proteins. At 6 degrees C, all the spectroscopic properties of these four proteins are about the same. The analysis of experimental data demonstrates that all three mutations induce a structural reorganization of the Fpg protein. However, only the P2E mutation lead to a reduced accessibility of some Trp residues to acrylamide quenching. It is concluded that the single P2E replacement induces a conformational change leading to a more rigid globular structure as opposed to the wild type and K57G and P2G mutations. The influence of the single mutations on the enzyme activities of the Fpg protein is discussed.

TI  - The relationship of brevetoxin 'length' and A-ring functionality to binding and activity in neuronal sodium channels.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brevetoxins are polyether ladder toxins that are ichthyotoxic at nanomolar concentrations. They bind to voltage-gated sodium channels, causing four distinct electrophysiological effects: (i) a shift of activation potential; (ii) occurrence of subconductance states; (iii) induction of longer mean open times of the channel; and (iv) inhibition of channel inactivation. We set out to determine whether these functions all require the same structural elements within the brevetoxin molecules. RESULTS: Several synthetically prepared structural analogs of brevetoxin B were examined in synaptosome receptor binding assays and by functional electrophysiological measurements. A truncated analog is not ichthyotoxic at micromolar concentrations, shows decreased receptor-binding affinity, and causes only a shift of activation potential without affecting mean open times or channel inactivation. An analog with the A-ring carbonyl removed binds to the receptor with nanomolar affinity, produces a shift of activation potential and inhibits inactivation, but does not induce longer mean open times. An analog in which the A-ring diol is reduced shows low binding affinity, yet populates five subconductance states. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that binding to sodium channels requires an elongated cigar-shaped molecule, approximately 30 A long. The four electrophysiological effects of the brevetoxins are not produced by a single structural feature, however, since they can be decoupled by using modified ligands, which are shown here to be partial sodium channel agonists. We propose a detailed model for the binding of brevetoxins to the channel which explains the differences in the effects of the brevetoxin analogs. These studies also offer the potential for developing brevetoxin antagonists.
