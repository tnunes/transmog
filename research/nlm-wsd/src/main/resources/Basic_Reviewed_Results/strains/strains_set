TI  - Effects of the murine genotype on T cell activation and cytokine production in murine mercury-induced autoimmunity.  
AB  - Mercury induces a systemic autoimmune condition characterized by auto-antibodies to the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (AFA) and systemic immune-complex (IC) deposits in genetically susceptible mouse strains. This study examines T cell activation and cytokine production following mercury exposure in genetically susceptible and resistant strains. Mercury injected s.c., according to the protocol for induction of autoimmunity, caused an early T cell activation, measured as an increase of IL-2-producing cells, and increased expression of the IL-2-receptor proteins CD25 and CD122 and of the proliferation marker CD71 on days 2-4 in the susceptible A.SW and A. TH strains. This was followed by a long-lasting increase in the number of T cells, dominated by CD4(+) cells. Mice of the susceptible A.SW strain showed a modest increase of TNF-alpha-, IFN-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells after 4-6 days, and a very distinct increase of IL-4-producing cells on days 8-10. The susceptible SJL strain (H-2(s)), severely deficient in Th2-promoting CD4(+), NK1.1(+) T cells, showed no increase of IL-4(+) cells on days 8-10. Instead, the number of IFN-gamma-producing cells was increased. Susceptible mice developed an increase of Ig-producing cells, AFA, and systemic IC-deposits. Genetically mercury-resistant A.TL mice showed a minimal increase of T cells, but no increase in cytokine-producing cells. We conclude that autoimmunogenic doses of HgCl2 induce an activation and proliferation of T cells in genetically susceptible mouse strains, as well as a broad increase of cytokine-producing cells, followed by a late predominance of the Th2-associated IL-4. One strain, severely deficient in Th2-promoting CD4(+), NK1.1(+) T cells, lacked the increase in IL-4(+) cells, indicating that a predominantly Th2-response is not necessary for induction of autoimmunity by mercury. However, a Th2-dominated response led to a faster and stronger B cell activation.

TI  - In vitro activity of trimethoprim alone compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species associated with upper respiratory tract infections.  
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used to treat various respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, for many patients, intolerance of the sulfonamide component precludes use of this combination. This study examined the activity of trimethoprim alone in comparison to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species implicated in respiratory tract infections. For Haemophilus influenzae, minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim were equal to or one dilution greater than those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with 56 of 58 strains inhibited by the former at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. All oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 96.7% of Streptococcus pyogenes were inhibited by trimethoprim < or = 2 micrograms/ml. In contrast, only 50% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by this concentration of trimethoprim, whereas 93.3% were susceptible to the combination at < or = 2/38 micrograms/ml. All oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and all Moraxella catarrhalis were resistant to trimethoprim, although many of the former and all of the latter were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

TI  - Human isolates of Staphylococcus caprae: association with bone and joint infections.  
AB  - Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative, DNase-positive member of the genus Staphylococcus usually associated with goats, but since 1991 a few laboratories have reported isolating the organism from human clinical specimens. We report on the isolation of 14 strains from human specimens and note that 10 strains were obtained from patients with bone and joint infections. Nine of the 10 infections started with traumatic fractures, and the other was a case of mastoiditis. Seven of these 10 infections were in patients with orthopedic prostheses, which appears to be a risk factor. Three of the 14 strains were from transplant patients. For three of the patients, S. caprae was the only organism isolated. S. caprae may be misidentified because it is not represented in the current MicroScan or Vitek identification systems which are in use in many laboratories, but the organism can be differentiated by a few biochemical tests. S. caprae produces positive results for DNase, pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase, and acid production from mannitol and maltose; it produces negative results for ornithine decarboxylase and tube coagulase.

TI  - Evaluation of a fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probe targeting 23S rRNA for in situ detection of Salmonella serovars in paraffin-embedded tissue sections and their rapid identification in bacterial smears.  
AB  - A method for the detection of Salmonella based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been developed and applied for the direct detection of Salmonella in pure cultures and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica subspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The specificity of the probe was tested by in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars belonging to subspecies I, II, IIIb, IV, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars from subspecies IIIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with a history of clinical salmonellosis. In these tissue sections the probe hybridized specifically to Salmonella serovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a fluorescence-labelled specific oligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identification of S. enterica in bacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LY333328, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide.  
AB  - LY333328 is a semisynthetic N-alkyl derivative of LY264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. LY333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). Glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, Gemella, Lactococcus, Listeria, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium. Test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included 56 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (of the VanA, VanB, and VanC phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus (S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible Staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from VanA enterococci (2 Enterococcus and 25 Listeria transconjugants). LY333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. In particular, the MICs of LY333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. LY333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Erysipelothrix (MIC range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against Lactobacillus strains. In minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill studies, LY333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by LY333328, with MBC-to-MIC ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. In attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of LY333328 per ml were obtained from the Staphylococcus and Enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.

TI  - Widespread detection of PER-1-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among nosocomial Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in Turkey: a nationwide multicenter study [published erratum appears in Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1998 Feb;42(2):484]  
AB  - We studied the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of PER-1-type beta-lactamases among Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated over a 3-month period in eight university hospitals from distinct regions of Turkey. A total of 72, 92, and 367 Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and P. aeruginosa isolates were studied, respectively. The presence of blaPER was determined by the colony hybridization method and later confirmed by isoelectric focusing. We detected PER-1-type beta-lactamases in 46% (33/72) of Acinetobacter strains and in 11% (40/367) of P. aeruginosa strains but not in Klebsiella strains. PER-1-type enzyme producers were highly resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin, intermediately resistant to amikacin, and susceptible or moderately susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Among PER-1-type-beta-lactamase-positive isolates, five Acinetobacter isolates and six P. aeruginosa isolates from different hospitals were selected for ribosomal DNA fingerprinting with EcoRI and SalI. The EcoRI-digested DNAs were later hybridized with a digoxigenin-labelled PER-1 probe. The ribotypes and the lengths of blaPER-carrying fragments were identical in four Acinetobacter strains. A single isolate (Ac3) harbored a PER gene on a different fragment (approximately 4.2 kbp) than the others (approximately 3.4 kbp) and showed a clearly distinguishable ribotype. Ribotypes of P. aeruginosa strains obtained with EcoRI showed three patterns. Similarly, in Pseudomonas strains two different EcoRI fragments harbored blaPER (approximately 4.2 kbp in five isolates and 3.4 kbp in one isolate). PER-1-type beta-lactamases appear to be restricted to Turkey. However, their clonal diversity and high prevalence indicate a high spreading potential.

These strains were compared to those of a strain of Vibrio cholerae biotype El Tor. The behaviour of the Non-O1 Vibrios was seen to be quite similar to those of the El Tor biotype in all aspects studied and antigenic correlations were found by means of immunoblotting and cytotoxin production on VERO cells. Since these bacterial strains may be pathogenic in humans, we believe it useful to describe some of their characteristics.

TI  - [Combination effect of fosfomycin to beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and macrolide antibiotics against clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae]  
AB  - It is well known that fosfomycin (FOM) shows the combination effects with some other antibiotics. Suck effects have not been known against Klebsiella pneumoniae, however. In this report, combination effects of FOM with beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and macrolide antibiotics were investigated against clinical isolates of both FOM-susceptible and resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. FOM had synergistic activities with beta-lactams such as ampicillin (ABPC) and cefminox (CMNX), and macrolide antibiotics as erythromycin (EM) and midecamycin (MDM) against all strains tested. Among beta-lactams, penicillin V showed synergistic actions against FOM-susceptible strain of Tf341A and additive actions against FOM-resistant 3 strains with FOM. Pheneticillin was synergistic with FOM against FOM-highly susceptible strain Tf341A and the additive or nearly synergistic effects against other strains. FOM with amoxicillin was synergistic against Tf341A, and FOM-resistant strain of Tf170B and additive against other strains. While the activities of combination of FOM with kanamycin or dibekacin against FOM-susceptible 2 strains were additive, those with amikacin were synergistic. Five different aminoglycosides tested showed antagonistic activities with FOM against 3 FOM-resistant strains. From these results, FOM appears to be clinically useful in treating FOM-susceptible and resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae in combination of 4 antibiotics such as ABPC, CMNX, EM, and MDM.

Cloning of these subunits was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using retinal cDNA libraries as templates. The nt sequence of alpha PDE predicts a 861-amino-acid polypeptide which is 97.7 per cent and 96.9 per cent identical to the bovine and human counterparts, respectively. PDE gamma encodes an 87-amino-acid polypeptide differing from bovine and murine gamma subunits by only one amino acid.

AB  - The isoenzyme profiles (IP) of 33 strains of Entamoeba histolytica isolated from patients and carriers of two regions in Brazil (Amazonia and Southeast) were determined. The enzymes phosphoglucomutase, glucose-phosphate isomerase, hexokinase and malic enzyme were considered. IP of the strains was correlated with culture conditions, time of maintenance in laboratory and clinical history of patients. The strains were maintained under polyxenic, monoxenic and axenic culture conditions: 27 polyxenic, 1 polyxenic and monoxenic, 1 polyxenic, monoxenic and axenic and 4 axenic only. The patients were symptomatic and asymptomatic. The symptomatic patients presented either non dysenteric (NDC) or dysenteric colitis (DC), associated or not with hepatic abscess (HA). One patient presented anal amoeboma (AM). The analysis of IP for isolates maintained in polyxenic culture showed non pathogenic IP (I) for strains from carriers and patients with NDC, while the strains isolated from patients presenting DC, HA and AM resulted in isolates II or XIX pathogenic IP. This parameter was not able to differentiate strains from carriers from symptomatic patients when these strains were found in axenic or monoxenic culture. All these strains displayed pathogenic IP (II), demonstrating the inability of this parameter to classifying for virulence since it showed identical IP for strains isolated from carriers or symptomatic patients.

TI  - Synaptic vesicle glutamate uptake in epileptic (EL) mice.  
AB  - The ATP-dependent glutamate uptake system of synaptic vesicles was investigated in epileptic (EL) mice to determine whether glutamate uptake activity correlates with seizure susceptibility or development. Given the focal seizure onset, glutamate uptake activity was measured in four separate brain regions: cerebrum (minus hippocampus), hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem. The EL values were compared to those of age-matched controls; DDY and ABP/LeJ (ABP) mice. The glutamate uptake specific activity for EL cerebrum was significantly higher than that for the control mice (approx. 400 days old), but was not elevated prior to seizure onset (46 days old). No difference in glutamate uptake was observed between the strains in the other brain regions. We conclude that increased synaptic vesicle glutamate uptake is brain-region specific (cerebrum) and is associated with the development or maintenance, rather than the initial cause, of seizures in the EL model of epilepsy.

TI  - Distribution of immunogenic epitopes on the two major immunodominant proteins (rOmpA and rOmpB) of Rickettsia conorii among the other rickettsiae of the spotted fever group.  
AB  - Forty-four monoclonal antibodies were raised against strain Seven, the type strain of Rickettsia conorii. Of these 44 monoclonal antibodies, 13, 27, and 4 were demonstrated to be directed against the 116-kDa protein (rOmpA), the 124-kDa protein (rOmpB), and lipopolysaccharide-like antigen, respectively. The antiprotein monoclonal antibodies were found to be directed against 29 distinct epitopes, which were located on the two major immunodominant proteins discussed above. Further analysis showed that strain-specific epitopes were located on the rOmpA protein and species- and subgroup-specific epitopes were located on the rOmpB protein. R. conorii Manuel, Indian tick typhus rickettsia, and Kenya tick typhus rickettsia also possessed all 29 epitopes, whereas the other rickettsiae of the spotted fever group (SFG) expressed between 3 and 25 epitopes, with the exception of Rickettsia helvetica, R. akari, and R. australis which did not possess any epitopes. Additional analyses by Western immunoblotting confirmed that the epitopes shared among the SFG rickettsiae were located on the same two high-molecular-mass proteins as on R. conorii. However, although epitopes on the R. conorii rOmpB protein were expressed on the rOmpB proteins of most other SFG rickettsiae, some were found on the rOmpA proteins of R. aeschlimannii, R. rickettsii, and R. rhipicephali. Both proteins possessing the common epitopes were found to have different sizes in the SFG rickettsial species. The different distributions of common epitopes in the SFG rickettsiae were also used to build a taxonomic dendrogram, which demonstrated that all the R. conorii strains formed a relatively independent cluster within the SFG rickettsiae and was generally consistent with previously proposed taxonomies.

TI  - Cloning and analysis of the glucosyl transferase gene encoding type I antigen in Shigella flexneri.  
AB  - The O-antigen of most Shigella flexneri serotypes contains an identical tetrasaccharide repeating unit. Apart from serotype Y, the O-antigen is modified by addition of a glucosyl and/or O-acetyl residue to a specific position in the O-unit. In this study the glucosyl transferase gene from a serotype 1 a has been cloned and identified. The bacteriophage SfV integrase (int) gene was used to probe a S. flexneri Y53 (serotype 1 a) cosmid library and 18 unique clones were identified. Southern hybridisation of these clones indicated two unlinked regions of the chromosome contained the int homologue. When expressed in a live candidate vaccine strain of S. flexneri serotype Y (SFL124), clones with one region produced type I antigen, whereas clones containing the other region produced mainly type Y antigen. One of the cosmid clones positive for type I antigen by agglutination and Western blotting was selected for further study. Genes involved in O-antigen glucosyl modification were mapped on a 5.8 kb fragment and subclones were produced which fully or partially expressed the type I antigen, depending on the extent of the clone. Fully and partially expressing clones may be useful vaccine candidate strains for protection against disease caused by two serotypes of S. flexneri.

AB  - In this paper; a promoter-probe plasmid pKK232-8 was used as a vector which functioned in E. coli. The plasmid pHH205 of Halobacterium halobium J7 was digested by two groups of restriction endonucleases BamHI-SalI and HindIII -SalI, recombined in vitro and transformed into E. coli. The transformants were selected on resistance plates to contain ampicillin (Am) and chloramphenicol (Cm). From random-selected 20 strains of transformants we obtained transformants T1 and T2, whose level of Cm resistance got to 110 micrograms/ml. The recombinant plasmids from T1 and T2 were named pJH and pJB, respectively. The resultes of analysis by restriction endonucleases digestion and molecular hybridization showed that recombinant plasmid pJH carried a inserted fragment with size of 800bp from plasmid pHH205. Experimental results of retransfomation proved further that the DNA fragment had promoter function in E. coli. Thus, this indicated that DNA fragments from plasmid of archaebaeteria (H halobium) may function as eubacteria (E. coil) promoters.

TI  - Simulation of the distribution of parental strains' genomes in RC strains of mice.  
AB  - Recombinant Congenic strains (RC strains) were developed to facilitate mapping of genes influencing complex traits controlled by multiple genes. They were produced by inbreeding of the progeny derived from a second backcross from a common 'donor' inbred strain to a common 'background' inbred strain. Each RC strain contains a random subset of approximately 12.5% of genes from the donor strain and 87.5% of genes from the background strain. In this way the genetic control of a complex disease may be dissected into its individual components. We simulated the production of the RC strains to study to what extent they have to be characterized in order to obtain sufficient information about the distribution of the parental strains' genomes in these strains and to acquire insight into parameters influencing their effectiveness in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The donor strain genome in the RC strains is fragmented into many segments. Genetic characterization of these strains with one polymorphic marker per 3.3 centiMorgans (cM) is needed to detect 95% of the donor strain genome. The probability of a donor strain segment being located entirely in between two markers of background strain origin that are 3 cM apart (and hence escaping detection) is 0.003. Although the donor strain genome in the RC strains is split into many segments, the largest part still occurs in relatively long stretches that are mostly concentrated in fewer than 13 autosomes, the median being 9 autosomes. Thus, in mapping QTLs, the use of RC strains facilitates the detection of linkage.

TI  - Characterization of hepatitis E virus (HEV) from Algeria and Chad by partial genome sequence.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze partial nucleotide sequences and derived peptide sequences of hepatitis E virus (HEV) from two outbreaks of hepatitis E in Africa (Chad 1983-1984; Algeria 1978-1980). A portion of ORF3 and the major portion of ORF2 were amplified by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloning into the pCRII vector. Sequences were then compared to the corresponding regions of reported full length HEV sequences. In the ORF2 and ORF3 regions, the homology between the Algerian and the Chad isolates at the nucleic acid level was 92 and 95%, respectively. At the peptide level the homology was 98% in both regions. In these regions, both strains are more related to Asian strains at the nucleic acid level (89 to 95%) and at the amino acid level (95 to 100%) than to the Mexico strain. At the peptide level the differences are less apparent. Both African isolates have amino acid changes in common with some reference strains although the Chad isolate has three unique changes. These African strains of HEV, based on the ORF2 and ORF3 phylogenetic trees, appear to be a distinct phylogenetic group, separate from the Mexican and Asian strains.

TI  - Increased prevalence of penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci in Japanese children with upper respiratory infection treated by beta-lactam agents and in those with oncohematologic diseases.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viridans group streptococci, especially penicillin-resistant strains, have been emerging as pathogens of bacteremia in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVES: To survey the penicillin susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci in Japanese children with and without oncohematologic diseases and to evaluate the effect of the short term administration of beta-lactam agents on the antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: We tested 113 isolates of viridans group streptococci by the microdilution method for the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to 10 antibiotics. We isolated 40 isolates from the throats of children with an upper respiratory infection (URI) before beta-lactam antibiotic treatment, 32 isolates after the treatment, 33 isolates in hospitalized children with oncohematologic diseases and 8 isolates from blood. RESULTS: Twenty-five isolates (62.5%) from the children with URI before treatment were penicillin-intermediate or -high level resistant (MIC > or = 0.25 microg/ml). The prevalence of those isolates after antibiotic treatment (87.5%) was significantly increased compared with that before treatment (P = 0.03). The prevalences of the penicillin-high level resistant isolates (MIC > or = 4 microg/ml) in the children with oncohematologic diseases (39.4%) and in the isolates from blood (62.5%) were significantly higher than that in the children with URI before treatment (12.5%) (P < 0.01). Decreased susceptibilities to other beta-lactam agents were observed in the penicillin-high level resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of penicillin-intermediate or -high level resistant viridans group streptococci in healthy Japanese children was documented. The administration of beta-lactam agents decreased the prevalence of penicillin-susceptible isolates in the children with URI. High prevalences of penicillin-high level resistant isolates were observed in the oncohematologic patients and in the isolates from blood.

TI  - Bacteremia due to Campylobacter species: clinical findings and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.  
AB  - From 1979 to 1996, 58 patients (mean age, 39.4 years) were treated for bacteremia due to Campylobacter species at the Hospitals Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain. Bacteremia was considered to be hospital acquired in 30% of these patients. Almost all the patients (93%) had underlying conditions; liver cirrhosis was the most frequent (34% of patients), and neoplasia, immunosuppressive therapy, and human immunodeficiency virus disease were also common.  Of the 58 Campylobacter strains isolated, 81% were C. jejuni, 10% were Campylobacter species, 7% were C. fetus, and one (2%) was C. coli. Resistance rates were: cephalothin, 82%; co-trimoxazole, 79%; quinolones, 54%; ampicillin, 20%; amoxicillin/clavulanate, 4%; erythromycin, 7%; gentamicin, 0; and tetracyclines, 0. Even though the majority of patients were immunocompromised, mortality was low (10.5%), and only one patient relapsed. Because of the high level of resistance to the quinolones in Campylobacter species, these drugs should not be used as empirical treatment, at least in Spain. Although the macrolides remain the antibiotics of choice, amoxicillin/clavulanate may be an effective alternative therapy.

The strains isolated were Shigella dysenteriae 1, S. flexneri and S.sonnei. All but one of the 14 strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The MIC of both the fluoroquinolones was 15 micrograms/ml for the resistant S.dysenteriae 1 strain (NRM4). Therefore, the careful use of antimicrobials is required for therapy of Shigellosis.

TI  - Recent emergence of new variants of Yersinia pestis in Madagascar.  
AB  - Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has been responsible for at least three pandemics. During the last pandemic, which started in Hong Kong in 1894, the microorganism colonized new, previously unscathed geographical areas where it has become well established. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the genetic stability of Y. pestis strains introduced into a new environment just under a century ago and to follow the epidemiology of any new genetic variant detected. In the present study, 187 strains of Y. pestis isolated between 1939 and 1996 from different regions of Madagascar and responsible mainly for human cases of bubonic and pneumonic plague were studied. Our principal genotyping method was rRNA gene profiling (ribotyping), which has previously been shown to be an effective scheme for typing Y. pestis strains of different geographical origins. We report that all studied Y. pestis strains isolated in Madagascar before 1982 were of classical ribotype B, the ribotype attributed to the Y. pestis clone that spread around the world during the third pandemic. In 1982, 1983, and 1994, strains with new ribotypes, designated R, Q, and T, respectively, were isolated on the high-plateau region of the island. Analysis of other genotypic traits such as the NotI genomic restriction profiles and the EcoRV plasmid restriction profiles revealed that the new variants could also be distinguished by specific genomic and/or plasmid profiles. A follow-up of these new variants indicated that strains of ribotypes Q and R have become well established in their ecosystem and have a tendency to spread to new geographical areas and supplant the original classical strain.

TI  - [Analysis of genome-type, serovar and antibiotic susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in Beijing Hospital China in 1991 to 1993]  
AB  - We analyzed the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility pattern and serovar for 192 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated at Beijing Hospital(China) from October 1991 to October 1993. The frequency of resistant strains was high, more than 15%, for ceftazidime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, gentamicin, tobramycin, tosufloxacin, ofloxacin and fosfomycin. The incidence of resistants against piperacillin and imipenem was significantly low. Among the 192 strains, 16 were designated as being multi-drug resistant strains(i.e.; resistant to more than 8 drugs out of 11 drugs), and all of the multi-drug resistant strains were isolated from inpatients. Predominant serovar of 192 strains were 60(31.3%) for G, 28(14.7%) for E, and 24(12.5%) for I. Multi-drug resistant strains have no characteristic serovar. Restriction enzyme SpeI digestion analysis(using pulse field electrophoresis) of P. aeruginosa-genome yielded several common patterns, and was shown to be useful for tracing the route of nosocomial infection. Further, isolates with closely related genome type, in which the size of one digested band was different, showed a different minimum inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in one genome type or new quinolones in the other genome type. Analysis of genome type and antibiotic susceptibility pattern may exhibit the antibiotic resistant gene.

TI  - Interaction of drugs for eradication therapy against antibiotic-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori.  
AB  - To clarify the interactions of drugs for combination therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection, especially due to antibiotic-resistant strains, we have evaluated the in vitro effect of combining different drugs. Using a modified time-kill assay, we tested the effect of combining 2 drugs from 4 agents; amoxicillin (AMPC), clarithromycin (CAM), metronidazole (MTZ) and lansoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor). The H. pylori in the study consisted of 4 strains sensitive to the all drugs, 2 strains resistant only to CAM, 2 strains resistant only to MTZ, and 2 strains resistant to both CAM and MTZ. From the 6 different drug combinations, synergism was observed for 5 of the combinations, among which the combination of AMPC and CAM revealed such effects most frequently. However, all of the strains which showed synergism were sensitive to both of the drugs. In the case of the strains resistant to CAM and/or MTZ, no synergism was demonstrated in any of the combinations including CAM and/or MTZ. When a strain was resistant to one drug from a combination, no synergism was detected. Thus, the administration of a drug to which the strains are resistant may have no advantage in the eradication therapy of H. pylori. For a more effective and safer therapy, susceptibility testing should be performed before treatment.

TI  - Cloning and sequencing of draTG genes and their downstream region of Azospirillum brasilense Yu62.  
AB  - An 8-kb fragment was cloned by probing the gene library of Azospirillum brasilense Yu62 with the 4.0-kb draTG fragment of A. brasilense Sp7. DNA hybridization of this fragment demonstrated that draTG genes were located in a 3.0-kb EcoR I-Kpn I fragment, and were contiguous to the nifH gene. This 3.0-kb fragment was completely sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis of the fragment revealed that it included the full-length draTG genes and two ORFs downstream of draG (ORF3 and incomplete ORF4). The draTG and downstream ORF3 are presumed to be cotranscribed as a single operon. Promoter element analysis of the sequenced region showed that there were some elements of the sigma 54-dependent promoter (DPEs and UASs) in the upstream region of draG and ORF3. This suggests that the draG and ORF3 might be transcribed independently in addition to being cotranscribed with draT. Both the DNA and amino acid sequences of the draTG genes from A. brasilense Yu62 were compared with those of other nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The results showed the draTG genes were highly conservative. There were only a few changes among strains and/or species. Homology analysis of ORF revealed that the ORF3 immediately downstream of draG was homologous not only with the ORF at the same position in Rhodospirillum rubrum and A. lipoferum, but also with the ORF14 of Azotobacter vinelandii and the ORF4 showed extensive similarity to yafJ of Escherichia coli.

TI  - Isolation, identification and increasing importance of 'free-living' amoebae causing human disease [see comments]  
AB  - Amphizoic small amoebic protozoa are capable of existing both in 'free-living' and in 'parasitic' form depending on the actual conditions. Two genera (Naegleria and Acanthamoeba) have become recognised as opportunist human parasites. Since the first description in 1965 of a lethal case of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria, many more (mostly lethal) cases have been reported, while granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), as well as eye (keratinitis, conjunctivitis, etc.), ear, nose, skin and internal organ infections caused by Acanthamoeba have also occurred in rapidly increasing numbers. Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species of Naegleria and Acanthamoeba are found worldwide in water, soil and dust, where they provide a potential source of infection. Successful differential diagnosis and appropriate (specific) therapy depends on precise laboratory identification of the 'free-living' amoebae. In most cases, isolation from the environment can be achieved, but identification and differentiation of the pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains is not easy. The methods presently available do not fulfil completely the requirements for specificity, sensitivity and reliability. Morphological criteria are inadequate, while thermophilic character, pH dependency and even virulence in infected mice, are not unambiguous features of pathogenicity of the different strains. More promising are molecular methods, such as restriction endonuclease digestion of whole-cell DNA or mitochondrial DNA, as well as iso-enzyme profile analysis after iso-electric focusing and staining for acid phosphatase and propionyl esterase activity. Use of appropriate monoclonal antibodies has also yielded promising results in the differentiation of human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. However, quicker, simpler, more specific and reliable methods are still highly desirable. The significance of endosymbiosis (especially with Legionella strains) is not well understood. The results of a systematic survey in Hungary for the isolation and identification of 'free-living' amoebae, including an investigation of the Hungarian amoebic fauna, the isolation of possibly pathogenic Naegleria strains and of some Acanthamoeba strains from eye diseases, as well as the finding of a case of endosymbiosis, are also reported here.

AB  - The pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. Seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 Teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. A total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Streptococcus mitis. Five strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. The infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. None of the Prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains in combination with A. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with S. mitis in 42-100%. No difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup I (P. intermedia) and serogroup II and III (P. nigrescens). The infectivity of P. intermedia or P. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. P. intermedia and P. nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in rabbits.

TI  - Subchronic inhalation and oral toxicity of N-vinylpyrrolidone-2. Studies in rodents.  
AB  - N-Vinylpyrrolidone-2 (NVP) is a monomeric compound used as an industrial intermediate. Nine of 11 studies previously reported involved exposure of rats (two different strains), mice or hamsters to NVP by the inhalation route at concentrations of up to 120 ppm (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) over a period of 1 wk to 12 months. The remaining two studies involved exposure of rats to NVP through the drinking water or by gavage at dose levels of up to 100 mg/kg body weight/day. Reduced body weight gain was seen in rats exposed by inhalation to 5 ppm or more for 3 months and in mice and hamsters exposed to 45 ppm for only 1 day. Effects were seen on haematological (reduced haemoglobin, erythrocyte count, haematocrit) and clinical chemistry parameters (specially raised gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and decreases in plasma protein), liver weight increase and liver lesions (centrilobular single-cell necrosis and foci of hepatocellular alteration) in rats and mice but not hamsters. Rats exposed to 40 mg/kg body weight/day NVP or more for 3 months by gavage developed similar liver changes. Atrophy of olfactory epithelium and hyperplasia of nasal respiratory epithelium was seen in rats exposed by inhalation to 5 ppm NVP for 7 wk but not in response to 1 ppm for 13 wk (no observed-adverse-effect level, NOAEL). These studies indicated that the upper respiratory tract and the liver are the main targets for NVP toxicity.

TI  - Comparison of bactericidal effects of commonly used antiseptics against pathogens causing nosocomial infections. Part 2.  
AB  - Opportunistic infections caused by gram-negative rods (GNR), conventionally regarded as organisms with low or no pathogenicity, and intractable infections caused by various resistant organisms pose a great problem now. In view of this, we determined the bactericidal effects of 5 commonly used disinfectants using as the test strains Xanthomonas maltophilia and Serratia marcescens, chosen among other GNR since they often cause nosocomial infections. Regarding the bactericidal activities against X. maltophilia and S. marcescens, both sensitive strains and resistant strains were killed within 20 s of exposure to povidone-iodine and sodium hypochlorite. With chlorhexidine, 1 strain each of both species was not killed within 10 min of exposure at a concentration of 0.2%. Both sensitive strains and resistant strains of X. maltophilia were killed within 20 s of exposure to benzalkonium at 0.02%, while a concentration of 0.1% was required for benzalkonium to kill S. marcescens within 20 s. With Tego-51, both sensitive strains and resistant strains of X. maltophilia were killed within 20 s at 0.02%, while 1 strain of S. marcescens was not killed within 20 s at a concentration of 0.1%. In the use of disinfectants, comparative bactericidal effects of various disinfectants against clinical isolates should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Quantitative determination of free amino acids in the hemolymph of autogenous and anautogenous strains of Culex tarsalis (Diptera: Culicidae).  
AB  - Autogenous and anautogenous strains were selected from the egg rafts of Culex tarsalis Coquillett collected from Coachella Valley, California. In autogenous (21-25 generations) and anautogenous (0-4 generations) strains used for hemolymph free amino acid analysis, the autogenous oviposition rates were 73.6-83.6% and 2.7-3.9%, the proportions of females undergoing autogenous ovarian development 120 h postemergence were 75.6 and 8.9%, respectively. To study the presence and quantities of free amino acids and explore their relationship to autogenous ovarian development, the 6 legs of females from both autogenous and anautogenous strains were removed at the coxo-femoral joints, and hemolymph was collected by centrifuging the bodies of 50-100 females. Proteins in the hemolymph were precipitated with 10% sulphosalicylic acid. On days 1, 4, 7, and 10 postemergence, a total of 17 free amino acids was found in females from the autogenous strain, and a total of 16 was found in females from the anautogenous strain in which asparagine (Asn) was absent. Comparisons of free amino acid concentrations between these 2 strains indicated that there were significant differences in total free amino acids and 13 individual free amino acids except Glu, Gln, Pro, and Met on day 1, total free amino acids and 14 individual free amino acids except Gln, Pro, and on day 4, and total free amino acids and 12 individual free amino acids except Asp, Glu, Gln, Pro, and Met on day 7 postemergence. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of individual and total free amino acids on day 10 postemergence. Female age affected free amino acid content in the autogenous strain, where total free amino acids and 14 individual free amino acid content in the autogenous strain, where total free amino acids and 14 individual free amino acids increased from day 1, peaked on day 4, declined on day 7, and declined further on day 10 postemergence. In the anautogenous strain, only total free amino acids and Ser, Gly, Ala, and Leu exhibited age-dependent changes in concentration, and the magnitude of changes in concentration was less than that in autogenous strain. Conclusively, autogenous ovarian development was the major reason for the changes in hemolymph free amino acid concentration postemergence. The current and previous findings indicate that the free amino acids, Arg, Gly, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, and Val putatively may be essential for vitellogenesis in mosquitoes.

The routine addition of lactoferrin to sensitivity media for testing of cystic fibrosis isolates may give more useful results than conventional tests as in-vivo conditions are more closely simulated.

This observation demonstrates that the occurrence of this phenomenon is not exclusive to influenza A(H1N1) viruses, as previously reported. In order to investigate the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we analysed the nucleotide sequence of the HA-1 region, presumed to be involved in the switch of haemagglutination properties, from the virus present in the original samples and in the corresponding strains isolated and cultivated in MDCK cells and in embryonated eggs. The substitution of amino acid 138 (Ala-->Ser) in MDCK cells could be related to the change in haemagglutination characteristics.

AB  - The three alleles of papG, the Gal(alpha1-4)Gal-specific adhesin gene of Escherichia coli P fimbriae, were detected in 101 (54%) of 187 E. coli bacteremia isolates from Boston, Long Beach, California, and Nairobi, Kenya, by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, and their distribution was compared with clonal structure and other bacterial and host characteristics. Allele II predominated overall (57% of papG+ strains, vs. 32% for III and 2% for I). Allele distribution differed significantly between centers. Alleles segregated according to enzyme electrophoretic lineage and O serogroup in patterns suggesting both vertical and horizontal transmission and emergence within E. coli in the temporal sequence II-->III-->I. Strains containing allele III preferentially agglutinated sheep erythrocytes, whereas strains containing allele II preferentially agglutinated human erythrocytes. Allele III was associated with hly, sfa, multiple copies of the pap operon, and cluster III of the phylogenetic tree. These findings indicate that among bacteremia isolates of E. coli, the three papG alleles exhibit distinctive associations with evolutionary lineages, hemagglutination phenotypes, and non-pap virulence properties.

AB  - Bacterial entry into intestinal host cells is the result of a fairly sophisticated manipulation of host cell machinery by the pathogens. To study further the potential cell target of Listeria spp., the in-vitro entry of L. monocytogenes strains into intestinal cells was examined in relation to the metabolism, proliferation and differentiation of the cells by the alamarBlue assay, [3H] thymidine incorporation, and brush border-associated enzyme activities, respectively. The study showed that cell metabolism was not involved in the entry of L. monocytogenes in three cell models (two human and one porcine). On the other hand, entry was closely related to the proliferation process and poorly related to the differentiation state of the cells. The use of L. monocytogenes mutants lacking invasion proteins showed that InlA and InlB acted in synergy to mediate the entry of L. monocytogenes into proliferative cells, whereas InlA alone seemed to be involved in the entry into non-proliferative cells. These two entry pathways could correspond to the two cellular processes used by L. monocytogenes to enter proliferative and non-proliferative cells, as suggested by the use of cytochalasin D, nocodazole, chloroquine and monodansylcadaverine. Taken together, we propose a hypothesis in which the entry of L. monocytogenes is mediated by interaction between randomly distributed E-cadherin on the surface of proliferative cells. In contrast, the entry into non-proliferative cells may involve pp60c-src, a proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase signal that modifies E-cadherin localisation. In conclusion, these results suggest that L. monocytogenes may preferentially enter crypt cells in vivo by a microfilament-dependent process, whereas the few bacteria that infect villus cells enter by an E-cadherin-internalin interaction that mediates microtubule-dependent endocytosis.

In type A(B) strain NCTC 2916, the neurotoxin gene is of type BoNT/A1 within a gene cluster that has identical organization to that found in BoNT/A2 type strains; these observations may be significant in establishing the origin of the BoNT-gene cluster.

TI  - Gene organization and sequence determination of the two botulinum neurotoxin gene clusters in Clostridium botulinum type A(B) strain NCTC 2916.  
AB  - The gene organization and nucleotide sequence of the type A and B BoNT-gene clusters in Clostridium botulinum strain NCTC 2916 were studied. The aim was to clarify the organization of genes within C. botulinum type A strains possessing an unexpressed BoNT/B gene. The BoNT/A-gene cluster includes genes encoding BoNT, NTNH and a part of P-47 (the gene for this protein was reported in strains of C. botulinum types E and F). Clustered with the silent BoNT/B gene were genes encoding NTNH, P-21 and HA-33. Sequencing analysis of the NTNHs revealed the presence of 471 amino acids identical in the type B and A gene clusters. This gene organization contrasts markedly with the purported organization in strain NCTC 2916 described by Henderson et al. (FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 140, 151-158). In type A(B) strain NCTC 2916, the neurotoxin gene is of type BoNT/A1 within a gene cluster that has identical organization to that found in BoNT/A2 type strains; these observations may be significant in establishing the origin of the BoNT-gene cluster.

TI  - Haemolysin production by strains of Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli.  
AB  - Twenty-one strains of Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) that hybridized with DNA probe CVD419 were examined for the ability to produce haemolysin. With solid media, all strains produced most haemolysin when grown in blood agar tubes and least when grown on blood agar plates incubated in air. Haemolysin production was increased considerably by incubating blood agar plates in an atmosphere comprising 8% carbon dioxide, 40% hydrogen and 52% nitrogen at 37 degrees C for 16 h, followed by 6 h at 21 degrees C in air. Haemolysin production was also increased when strains were grown on L-agar containing the iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) prior to subculture on blood agar. Intracellular haemolysin was detected in five out of the 21 strains of E. coli grown on L-agar in the atmosphere described above, but haemolysin was not detected in L-broth culture supernatants. The haemolysins lysed guinea pig, mouse and ferret erythrocytes, but not human, rabbit, rat, turkey or chicken erythrocytes. Also, the addition of calcium ions to culture media was not required for haemolytic activity. It was concluded that haemolysins produced by VTEC appear to be quite distinct from E. coli alpha-haemolysin and resemble a form of beta-haemolysin.

TI  - Lectin reactivity and virulence among strains of Listeria monocytogenes determined in vitro using the enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2.  
AB  - Forty-six cultures of Listeria monocytogenes (including clinical, food and collection strains) were serotyped, characterized for motility, haemolysis and phospholipase activities and tested for lectin agglutination using a four-lectin set. Lectin reactivity (i.e. agglutination by one or more of the four lectins) was observed in all 12 clinical isolates, 16 of the 23 food isolates and eight of the 11 collection strains. Virulence was evaluated in vitro based on strains' ability to invade the human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2. In gentamicin survival experiments, recovery of viable intracellular bacteria among lectin-unreactive strains was usually 100-1000-fold lower than among lectin-reactive haemolytic strains, and lower than among nonhaemolytic strains. Considerable cytopathogenic effects were produced by lectin-reactive haemolytic strains in trypan-blue-stained cell monolayers, whereas lectin-unreactive and nonhaemolytic strains produced no detectable cytopathogenic effect. Among lectin-reactive strains, the number of listerial cells associated with Caco-2 monolayers was more than tenfold greater than among lectin-unreactive strains. Cell invasion was inhibited by pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with sugars recognized by the lectins or of listeriae with enzymes which removed the same sugars from the bacterial surface. The results suggest that the study of lectin interactions could be helpful in understanding the pathogenicity potential of isolates of food and environmental origin.

TI  - Morphological diversity of cultured canine gastric Helicobacter spp.  
AB  - The cell morphology, the number of flagella, the occurrence of periplasmic fibrils and ultrastructural structures of five groups of cultured canine gastric Helicobacter spp. were compared. The study included four strains of Helicobacter felis, four strains of Helicobacter bizzozeronii, one strain of 'Flexispira', six strains of an unnamed spiral organism 2 and one strain of an unnamed spiral organism 3 which were isolated from gastric biopsies. Cultures were studied with negative staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial dimensions were measured from the negative staining samples and values were tested with ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. The organisms studied differed from each other morphologically. H. felis was a slightly spiraled organism with periplasmic fibrils. 'Flexispira' was a thin and straight organism with periplasmic fibrils. H. bizzozeronii was a tightly spiraled organism. Spiral organism 2 was loosely spiraled and thicker than the other organisms. Spiral organism 3 was a short curved rod having a single bipolar flagellum. The other species had multiple flagella. As a conclusion the canine gastric Helicobacter spp. can be differentiated from each other morphologically with an electron microscope. The morphological differences were mainly found in the structures involved in motility. The importance of the differences may lie in their impact on the colonization in a gastric mucous environment.

AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against Enterococcus spp. was compared with that of amoxycillin, vancomycin, telcoplanin and erythromycin. The susceptibility of 106 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, 92 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was tested. Only one strain of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium was not susceptible to < or = 0.5 mg/L quinupristin/dalfopristin; this strain required 4 mg/L. All strains of E. faecalis were inhibited by < or = 8 mg/L quinupristin/dalfopristin and all VRE strains were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/L. In contrast, teicoplanin and vancomycin showed inhibitory activity against E. faecalis and E. faecium but not against VRE. Amoxycillin was active against E. faecalis but not usually against E. faecium and showed variable activity against VRE; 38% of E. faecalis, 84% of E. faecium and 80% of VRE strains were resistant to erythromycin. The bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against E. faecium exceeded that of the comparator drugs as judged by MIC:MBC ratios and killing curves. The MBC99 of quinupristin/dalfopristin determined by a microdilution broth technique was < or = 1 mg/L for E. faecium. Four of the five strains of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium and three of the five VRE strains tested with time-kill curves showed a > or = 2 log reduction in viable count after exposure to quinupristin/dalfopristin for 6 h.

TI  - Evaluation of the RapID CB Plus system for identification of Corynebacterium species and other gram-positive rods.  
AB  - Due to the difficulty of identifying Corynebacterium spp. with standard methods, we compared them with the RapID CB Plus system (Remel, Lenexa, Kans. [formerly Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Norcross, Ga.]), which consists of 4 carbohydrate and 14 preformed enzyme tests, for the identification of 98 clinical isolates of Corynebacterium sp., other coryneforms, Listeria monocytogenes, and 17 ATCC strains. Forty (95%) of 42 strains of Corynebacterium spp. were accurately identified to the species level by the RapID CB Plus system, and two additional strains of C. striatum were identified with one additional conventional test for lipid requirement. Twenty-seven (75%) of the 36 coryneform strains tested were identified correctly to the species level. However, three of four strains of Brevibacterium sp. and all seven of the L. monocytogenes strains were identified to the genus level only. Actinomyces strains had variable results, and the one strain of Arcanobacterium haemolyticum tested was not identified. Overall, the RapID CB Plus system compared favorably with the conventional methods, was easy to inoculate and interpret, and is promising as a new method for identification of gram-positive bacilli.

AB  - One hundred and twenty-five strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus carrying both the tdh and trh genes were selected from the strains isolated from the travelers with diarrhea by an hybridization test using polynucleotide probes. The levels of TDH produced by these strains and the association between the TDH levels and related characteristics in these strains were analyzed. The TDH level varied greatly from strain to strain, but none of the levels was as high as that of the typical Kanagawa phenomenon-positive strains.  The strains were classified into "TDH producer" (18 strains), "Low-level TDH producer" (85 strains), and "No TDH producer" (22 strains) based on the results of a modified Elek test and the hemolysis assay on Wagatsuma agar. The highest TDH level achieved by the "TDH producer" was twofold lower than that of the Kanagawa phenomenon-positive strains as assayed by the RPLA method. All strains possessed the toxR gene. The trh1 and trh2 genes were detected in, respectively, 105 and 20 strains, and no correlation existed between the type of the trh gene and the levels of TDH produced. Considerable restriction fragment length polymorphism was observed with the tdh gene-bearing HindIII DNA fragment in different strains, but it was not related with the TDH level.

TI  - Increasing antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae.  
AB  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has become a major clinical problem in several parts of the world. However, there is a lack of data from Southeast Asia. We therefore initiated a study to determine the serogroups/serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains of S. pneumoniae isolated in our laboratory. In 1995, we isolated 144 strains of S. pneumoniae. Thirty-six (25.0%) strains were resistant to penicillin of which 19 (13.2%) were highly resistant (minimal inhibitory concentration > 1.0 microgram/ml). Thirty-eight (26.4%) strains were resistant to erythromycin, 75 (52.1%) were resistant to tetracycline, 48 (33.3%) were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and 29 (20.1%) were resistant to chloramphenicol. Twenty of the penicillin-resistant strains also had diminished susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Strains resistant to penicillin belonged to serogroups/serotypes 6 (n = 1), 9 (n = 1), 23 (n = 4), 14 (n = 6) and 19 (n = 20). Children under 5 years of age were more likely than older children and adults to have isolates resistant to penicillin (52.9% versus 16.2%, P = 0.00002). Penicillin-resistant strains were more likely than penicillin-susceptible strains to be multidrug-resistant (86.1% versus 7.4%, P < 0.000005). We concluded that there is a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in our isolates especially among very young children. Most penicillin-resistant strains belong to serogroup 19 and are also resistant to multiple drugs.

TI  - Revised group classification of the genus Spiroplasma.  
AB  - Significant changes have been made in the systematics of the genus Spiroplasma (class Mollicutes) since it was expanded by revision in 1987 to include 23 groups and eight sub-groups. Since that time, two additional spiroplasmas have been assigned group numbers and species names. More recently, specific epithets have been assigned to nine previously designated groups and three sub-groups. Also, taxonomic descriptions and species names have been published for six previously ungrouped spiroplasmas. These six new organisms are: Spiroplasma alleghenense (strain PLHS-1T) (group XXVI), Spiroplasma lineolae (strain TALS-2T) (group XXVII), Spiroplasma platyhelix (strain PALS-1T) (group XXVIII), Spiroplasma montanense (strain HYOS-1T) (group XXXI), Spiroplasma helicoides (strain TABS-2T) (group XXXII) and Spiroplasma tabanidicola (strain TAUS-1T) (group XXXIII). Also, group XVII, which became vacant when strain DF-1T (Spiroplasma chrysopicola) was transferred to group VIII, has been filled with strain Tab 4c. The discovery of these strains reflects continuing primary search in insect reservoirs, particularly horse flies and deer files (Diptera: Tabanidae). In the current revision, new group designations for 10 spiroplasma strains, including six recently named organisms, are proposed. Three unnamed but newly grouped spiroplasmas are strain TIUS-1 (group XXIX; ATCC 51751) from a typhiid wasp (Hymenoptera: Tiphiidae), strain BIUS-1 (group XXX; ATCC 51750) from floral surfaces of the tickseed sunflower (Bidens sp.) and strain BARC 1901 (group XXXIV; ATCC 700283). Strain BARC 2649 (ATCC 700284) from Tabanus lineola has been proposed as a new sub-group of group VIII. Strains TIUS-1 and BIUS-1 have unusual morphologies, appearing as helices at only certain stages in culture. In this revision, potentially important intergroup serological relationships observed between strain DW-1 (group II) from a neotropical Drosophila species and certain sub-group representatives of group I spiroplasmas are also reported.

TI  - Genetic analysis of the difference in diet-induced atherosclerosis between the inbred mouse strains SM/J and NZB/BINJ.  
AB  - To identify the genetic factors affecting susceptibility to atherosclerosis, we studied the inheritance of plasma total cholesterol (TC) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and susceptibility to atherosclerotic lesion formation in an (SM/J[SM] x NZB/B1NJ[NZB]) outcross, an (SM/NZB)FI[F1] x SM backcross, and the NXSM recombinant inbred (RI) strain set. After 18 or 26 weeks on the atherogenic diet, lesion sizes in female mice were 160+/-110 (SE) microm2 for NZB, 100+/-60 for F1, and 3800+/-920 for SM. After 0, 4, or 26 weeks on the atherogenic diet, NZB had higher TC and HDL-C levels than either SM or F1. The F1 progeny had TC and HDL-C levels slightly higher than or similar to the SM/J parent, while lesion size in the F1 progeny was more similar to the NZB parent.  Among the 15 RI strains, 8 resembled NZB and F1, 3 resembled SM, and 4 were intermediate between NZB and SM for lesion size. For the (SM x NZB)F1 x SM backcross offspring, 26 resembled NZB and F1, 7 resembled SM, and 6 were intermediate between NZB and SM for lesion size. There was poor correlation between lesion size and plasma TC or HDL-C in the parental strains and the backcross. These data suggest that resistance to atherosclerosis is determined by at least one major dominant gene contributed by the NZB strain, which we have named Ath8. Ath8 segregates independently of genes controlling TC and HDL-C levels.

TI  - Identification and natural antibiotic susceptibility of Morganella morganii.  
AB  - Our data should elucidate whether or not natural antibiotic susceptibility can be used as an aid for subspecies or biovar discrimination of Morganella morganii (II). Furthermore, our goal was to create a database of the natural susceptibility of M. morganii (III) and we were interested in the relative frequency of the recently described subspecific taxa (I). On the basis of trehalose fermentation (TRE), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and lysine decarboxylase (LDC) activities, we determined the biovar for 90 clinical isolates of M. morganii.  Within these strains we examined the natural antibiotic susceptibility of 53 morganellae to 70 antibiotics by determination of the MICs with a microdilution procedure. (I): 80 strains (89%) of all morganellae belonged to M. morganii ssp. morganii (TRE-), with biovar A (LDC-, ODC+) predominating (67 strains). The remaining strains of this subspecies were identified as biovar B (LDC+, ODC+; 12 strains) and biovar C (LDC-, ODC-, one strain). Ten strains of M. morganii ssp. sibonii (TRE+) were found: four strains belonged to biovar F (LDC variable, ODC-) and six strains to biovar G (LDC-, ODC). (II): With one exception we found no significant differences in antibiotic susceptibility between different biovars. M. morganii ssp. morganii strains are more susceptible to tetracycline than strains of M. morganii ssp. sibonii, but there is no evidence that this parameter could be useful to differentiate biovars within a subspecies. It could be shown that 8 of 30 strains of biovar A and 2 of 12 strains of biovar B were tetracycline resistant. However, one M. morganii ssp. sibonii strain was clinically susceptible to tetracycline according to French and American standards. (III): The natural population of M. morganii is primarily (naturally) resistant to certain penicillins like benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, and amoxicillin, first and second generation cephalosporins (excluding cefoxitin), cefpodoxime, all antibiotics of the ML group (macrolides and lincosamides), sulfamethoxazole, glycopeptides, fosfomycin, and fusidic acid, naturally sensitive to aminoglycosides, piperacillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, third and fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, quinolones, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. M. morganii is naturally resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. The natural resistance pattern is useful for validation of sensitivity tests. Susceptibility to antibiotics is an unsuitable parameter for the discrimination of the described subspecific taxa of M. morganii. M. morganii strains that do not belong to biovar A are rare.

TI  - Prevalence of enterotropic and polytropic mouse hepatitis virus in enzootically infected mouse colonies [see comments]  
AB  - Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes the most prevalent viral infection in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. According to their primary replication site, different strains of MHV segregate into two overlapping biotypes, enterotropic and polytropic. These two groups vary greatly in disease pattern, pathogenicity, immune response, and duration of infection. Historically, the polytropic MHV strains represent the extensively studied prototype strains that have minimal enterotropism, whereas enterotropic MHV strains have been less characterized. Anecdotal reports suggest that most MHV strains encountered today belong to the enterotropic biotype. We have identified 15 isolates of MHV from 19 independent enzootically infected mouse colonies. Sequencing of a variable region of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of each isolate confirmed that all were independent genetic variants. The principal tissue tropism of the new isolates was determined by experimental inoculation of infant mice and examination of intestine, liver, spleen, and brain for lesions. Nine isolates infected only intestine; four isolates infected intestine and liver; one isolate infected intestine, liver, and brain; and one isolate infected liver. These results confirm that the enterotropic MHV biotype is predominant in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. The MHV biotype features need to be taken into consideration when dealing with MHV infections.

TI  - Natural truncation of RANTES abolishes signaling through the CC chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR3, impairs its chemotactic potency and generates a CC chemokine inhibitor.  
AB  - Selective leukocyte trafficking towards sites of inflammation is mediated by chemokines. RANTES is a CC chemokine that attracts lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, eosinophils, basophils and NK cells. A natural form of human RANTES lacking two N-terminal residues was isolated from stimulated sarcoma cells, fibroblasts, and leukocytes. RANTES(3-68) showed a more than tenfold reduction in chemotactic potency for monocytes and eosinophils. To elucidate the mechanism involved, receptor recognition studies were performed. In cells transfected with the CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 5, the major co-receptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, RANTES(3-68) mobilized calcium and desensitized RANTES(1-68)-induced calcium fluxes equally well as RANTES(1-68). However, RANTES(3-68) was ineffective on CCR1 and CCR3 transfectants. The reduced potency of natural RANTES(3-68) by selective loss of receptor-activating characteristics was confirmed with recombinant RANTES(3-68). In chemotaxis assays using monocytic cells, RANTES(3-68) inhibited RANTES(1-68), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta or monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), but not MCP-1- or MCP-2-induced chemotaxis. Thus, a minor post-translational modification has a remarkable impact on the biological activities of RANTES and a pathophysiologically induced change in the relative amounts of intact and truncated RANTES might affect the outcome of inflammation or HIV infection.

TI  - 1,1,3-Trioxo-2H,4H-thieno[3,4-e][1,2,4]thiadiazine (TTD) derivatives: a new class of nonnucleoside human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase inhibitors with anti-HIV-1 activity.  
AB  - We report the development of a new group of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). One of the most active congeners of this series of 1,1,3-trioxo-2H,4H-thieno[3,4-e] [1,2,4]thiadiazine (TTD) derivatives, i.e., 2-(3-fluorobenzyl)-4-cyanomethylen-l,1,3-trioxo-2H,4H- thieno [3,4-e] [1,2,4] thiadiazine) (QM96639) was found to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 [HIV-1 (IIIB)] replication in MT-4 cells at a concentration of 0.09 microM. This compound was toxic for the host cells only at a 1,400-fold higher concentration. The TTD derivatives proved effective against a variety of HIV-1 strains, including those that are resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), but not against HIV-2 (ROD) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV/ MAC251).  HIV-1 strains containing the L100I, K103N, V106A, E138K, Y181C, or Y188H mutations in their reverse transcriptase (RT) displayed reduced sensitivity to the compounds. Their cross-resistance patterns correlated with that of nevirapine. 2-Benzyl-4-cyanomethylen-1,1,3-trioxo-2H,4H-thieno[3,4-e] [1,2,4]thiadiazine (QM96521) enhanced the anti-HIV-1 activity of AZT and didanosine in a subsynergistic manner. HIV-1-resistant virus containing the V179D mutation in the RT was selected after approximately six passages of HIV-1 (IIIB) in CEM cells in the presence of different concentrations of QM96521. From structure-activity relationship analysis of a wide variety of TTD derivatives, a number of restrictions appeared as to the chemical modifications that were compatible with anti-HIV activity. Modelling studies suggest that in contrast to most other NNRTIs, but akin to nevirapine, QM96521 does not act as a hydrogen bond donor in the RT-drug complex.

TI  - Flavohemoglobin expression and function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No relationship with respiration and complex response to oxidative stress.  
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a flavohemoglobin, encoded by the gene YHB1, whose function is unclear. Previous reports presented evidence that its maximal expression requires disruption of mitochondrial respiration and that it plays a role in the response to oxidative stress. We have studied the expression of YHB1 in respiratory deficient cells and in cells exposed to various compounds causing oxidative stress. Several different strains and approaches (spectroscopic detection of the oxygenated form of Yhb1p, beta-galactosidase activity of a YHB1-lacZ fusion, and Northern blot analysis) were used to demonstrate that YHB1 expression and Yhb1p production are not increased by respiration deficiency. YHB1 expression was unchanged in cells challenged with antimycin A or menadione, while it decreased in cells exposed to H2O2, diamide, dithiothreitol, and Cu2+. Transcription of YHB1 is not under the control of the transcriptional factor Yap1p. These results do not support a participation of YHB1 in the genetic response to oxidative stress. We also analyzed the growth phenotypes associated with altered Yhb1p production using YHB1-deleted strains and strains that greatly overproduced Yhb1p. Yhb1p appears to protect cells against the damage caused by Cu2+ and dithiothreitol, while sensitizing them to H2O2. Yhb1p overproduction in a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant decreased its growth rate. These data indicate that there is a complex relationship(s) between Yhb1p function(s) and cell defense reactions against various stresses.

TI  - The different binding patterns of two immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies to Cryptococcus neoformans serotype A and D strains correlate with serotype classification and differences in functional assays.  
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans strains have historically been divided into serotypes A and D on the basis of reactivity with rabbit sera. Previously, we noted that two murine immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the capsular glucuronoxylomannan produced different indirect immunofluorescence (IF) patterns, described as annular and punctate, when bound to C. neoformans cells from different strains. In this study, we examined the reactivity of these two MAbs, known as 12A1 and 13F1, with 20 C. neoformans var. neoformans strains, of which 13 were serotype A and 7 were serotype D. For all strains, MAb binding was studied by IF and agglutination assays. In addition, we blindly tested the IF patterns of 22 C. neoformans var. neoformans strains. For selected strains, MAb binding was studied by flow cytometry (FACScan) and phagocytosis assays. The epitopes recognized by MAbs 12A1 and 13F1 were found in all of the strains. MAb 12A1 binding produced an annular IF pattern with all of the strains, irrespective of the serotype classification. MAb 13F1 binding produced annular binding with all of the serotype A strains and punctate binding with 19 of 20 serotype D strains. In general, the punctate IF pattern was associated with lower fluorescence intensity, a requirement for higher antibody concentrations to produce yeast cell agglutination, and lower opsonic efficacy. Our results provide strong support for the existing classification of two serological types for strains assigned to variety neoformans and indicate qualitative and quantitative antigenic differences among serotype A and D strains.

TI  - Levofloxacin selects fluoroquinolone-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus less frequently than ciprofloxacin.  
AB  - Seventeen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with unique genotypes were examined to determine if resistance occurs more frequently with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. The mean single-step resistance rate to 4 x MIC of ciprofloxacin was 1.05 x 10(-5) (range <4.82 x 10[-11] to 5.06 x 10[-5]), and that to levofloxacin was 4.03 x 10(-6) (range <3.57 x 10[-13] to 4.10 x 10[-5]) (P < 0.05). When serially passaged, the mean MICs of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased 3.0 +/- 1.5-fold and 1.8 +/- 1.4-fold, respectively (P < 0.05).  Only four strains became resistant to levofloxacin, but eight became resistant to ciprofloxacin (P < 0.05). Ciprofloxacin selects resistant MRSA more frequently than levofloxacin.

AB  - Analysis of the molecular properties of fusion (F) proteins of field isolates of canine distemper virus (CDV) by immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an identical molecular mass of F protein of 3 field isolates as well as the Onderstepoort laboratory strain. Sequencing showed that the F gene of a field isolate (the Yanaka strain) shared 90.1% and 95.7% identities with the Onderstepoort strain at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. All of the 13 cysteine residues and 4 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were completely conserved amongst these strains. These results indicate that the F proteins is much less heterogeneous than that observed in the hemagglutinin proteins of CDV.

TI  - Mismatch G-T binding activity and MSH2 expression is quantitatively related to sensitivity of cells to methylating agents.  
AB  - To elucidate mechanisms involved in alkylating drug resistance, Chinese hamster cells resistant to methylating agents have been generated upon transfection with human DNA. Here it is shown that these Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) variants exhibit the tolerance phenotype: they are alkyltransferase deficient (Mex-), cross-resistant to 6-thioguanine, exhibit reduced G-T binding (MutS alpha) activity and express the mismatch repair protein MSH2 at a significantly lower level than the corresponding control. By comparing wild-type cells with different tolerant strains that show gradual differences in resistance to methylating agents, it was shown that both the G-T binding activity and the amount of MSH2 protein inversely correlates with the level of methylating drug resistance. Although the tolerant cell variants analysed express MSH2 at a significantly lower level than the wild-type, MSH2 mRNA expression was not impaired. Furthermore, MSH2 promoter activity was not reduced upon transient transfection into tolerant cells. The results indicate that quantitative differences in expression of components of mismatch repair do exist in mammalian cells that affect cell survival upon methylation. It appears that post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in regulation of MSH2 expression.

TI  - [Clinical study on azithromycin in 10% fine granules and 100mg capsules in the field of pediatrics]  
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100 mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. The following results were obtained in our studies of AZM for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. MICs of AZM, erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. Among Gram-positive cocci, MICs of AZM ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). These MICs were similar to those of the other macrolides. Among Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of AZM were 0.05 micrograms/ml against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. Against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs of AZM were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. One strain of M. pneumoniae showed tolerance to AZM at MIC 25 micrograms/ml. The other agents exhibited higher MIC than AZM against this organism. 2. Plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. The patients received AZM at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. Drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after Day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. Urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules. Drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. Urinary excretion rates of AZM in three patients on capsules lied in a range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. Effectiveness of AZM in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. AZM was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. Effectiveness of AZM in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. AZM was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. AZM in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. AZM in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. As for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of AZM. One patient on AZM capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. As for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased WBC, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased GOT and GPT, one with increased GPT. They were all on fine granular form of AZM. As far as abnormalities found in patients administered with AZM in capsular form, two showed decreased WBC, one decreased WBC along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.

TI  - Glycoprotein B genotype correlates with cell tropism in vivo of human cytomegalovirus infection.  
AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains can be classified into four genotypes of the glycoprotein B (gB). In a previous study, the gB genotype 1 was found more frequently in bone marrow transplant recipients with nonfatal HCMV infection than in patients who died from HCMV disease [Fries et al. (1994): Journal of Infectious Diseases 169:769-774]. The distribution and cell tropism of different gB types in vivo were investigated. The gB type of HCMV was determined in blood or urine specimen from 76 organ and 47 bone marrow transplant recipients using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The leukocyte populations (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, T lymphocytes, non-T lymphocytes) of 20 viremic patients were purified by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and examined for HCMV infection by PCR. Sequence analysis of four randomly selected strains showed that gB types were similar to published sequences and no atypical gB types were found. Within the compartments blood and urine, the gB types were almost equally distributed, whereas the gB type 1, in contrast to gB types 2 and 3, did not infect T lymphocytes in vivo. These data show that the gB type correlates with viral tropism in vivo and thus provides further evidence that the gB variation may indeed influence the virulence of HCMV.

TI  - Sensitivity to commercial disinfectants, and the occurrence of plasmids within various Listeria monocytogenes genotypes isolated from poultry products and the poultry processing environment.  
AB  - The European Suspension Test was used to assess the relative resistance of 19 individual Listeria monocytogenes genotypes, isolated from the poultry processing environment, to three commercially used disinfectants employed in the plant at the time of their isolation. To establish the relative resistance between the strains, the concentration of each disinfectant was reduced until inter-strain variation became apparent. For Darasan 214 and 7058, variation was detected at 0.1% and 0.5% v/v, respectively, while Daraclean 7361 had to be reduced to only 2.5% v/v. At these concentrations, the mean microbiocidal effect (ME) of each disinfectant ranged between 4.3 and 3.1 log10 reduction in cfu ml-1. Significant differences between the strains were obtained with respect to their resistance to the disinfectants employed (P < 0.01), but the overall log10 reduction for genotypes 'A1' and 'A2', which were found to persist in the poultry processing environment, were not found to be significantly different from the genotypes which had been isolated on a more sporadic basis (P > 0.05). The L. monocytogenes strains fell into four groups with respect to incidence and size of plasmids isolated. The first group contained strains which carried two plasmids (5 and 40 MDa) and the other three (groups 2, 3 and 4) comprised strains which carried a single plasmid (14, 47 and 52 MDa, respectively). There was no correlation between persistent and sporadic strains with respect to incidence and size of plasmids isolated. Moreover, the strains which carried no plasmids were found to be as resistant to the disinfectants as those which did carry plasmids, suggesting that the plasmids isolated did not confer resistance of L. monocytogenes planktonic cells to the disinfectants tested. Therefore, it is unlikely that the strains which had been found to persist in the poultry processing environment did so by means of plasmid-mediated resistance to the commercial disinfectants used.

TI  - Serological and genomic characterization of human rotaviruses detected in China.  
AB  - A total of 1,385 stool specimens were collected from children with diarrhea at two hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 1994 and 1995, and screened for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of viral RNA. Group A rotavirus was detected with high frequency; 56.5% (87/154) and 40.8% (502/1,231) of the specimens collected in 1994 and 1995, respectively, were positive for rotavirus. Assignment of G serotype and P type (VP4 genotype) of group A rotavirus by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies and/or PCR, respectively, showed that strains of G2-P[4] and G1-P[8] specificity were predominant in 1994 and in 1995, respectively. In contrast, a single strain was found to have a P[9] type specificity, and no G4 strain was detected. Unusual combinations of RNA pattern-subgroup-G serotype-P type, such as long pattern-subgroup I-G1-P[8], short pattern-subgroup II-G3-P[4] and short pattern-subgroup I-G1-P[4], were detected in four specimens. Nucleotide sequences of the VP8* and/or NSP5 genes from two Chinese P[8] strains 470 and 582 and one Chinese P[9] strain 512 as well as five Japanese P[9] strains (K8, AU1, M318, 0264, and 0265) were determined and compared with the published sequences of the corresponding gene. In the phylogenetic tree of VP8* sequences of P[9] strains, which formed two clusters each having strain K8 or AU-1 as the representative strain, the Chinese P[9] strain was found in the cluster represented by AU-1, although it was most distantly related to other strains. While NSP5 sequences of human strains with P[9] specificity were related to simian and bovine strains, that of Chinese P[8] strains was most closely related to those of porcine strains. A single group C rotavirus (No. 208) was detected. Nucleotide sequences of its VP4, VP6, VP7, and NSP4 genes were very similar to those of group C human rotaviruses detected worldwide.

TI  - Supernatant cytotoxicity and proteolytic activity of selected oral bacteria against human gingival fibroblasts in vitro.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if endodontic bacterial act in vitro on human gingival fibroblast functions via extracellular products. The bacteria used were Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Peptostreptoccocus micros and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Supernatants were collected from bacterial cultures at the beginning of the stationary phase when their density was similar. Toxins that inhibited fibroblast proliferation were found in all culture supernatants of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial strains, except for Prev. nigrescens. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant was about 1000 fold higher than the others. This supernatant diluted to 1/1000 led to total fibroblast growth inhibition whereas only 25% growth inhibition was obtained with Capn. ochracea and Pept. micros diluted to 1/10. Bacterial supernatant proteolytic activity was investigated in confluent fibroblast cultures that were incubated for 48 hr with each of the supernatants diluted to 1/2 except for A. actinomycetemcomitans supernatant diluted to 1/20. Indirect immunofluorescence studies of extracellular-matrix molecules, followed by immunoelectrophoretic analysis of extracts of whole-cell layers, demonstrated that only conditioned medium of Prev. nigrescens had a proteolytic activity capable of degrading the greater part of type I collagen and fibronectin fibres in the extracellular matrix.

AB  - AIM: To examine the vacA genotypes of Helicobacter pylori strains in Japan and to define whether any specific genotype was associated with gastric cancer. METHODS: The allelic variation of vacA gene was studied using a recently introduced polymerase chain reaction based vacA genotyping system. RESULTS: 80 H pylori strains were isolated from gastric biopsies of 40 patients with gastric cancer and 40 control subjects in a Japanese population. All strains were s1/m1 subtype and 79 of 80 strains were classified as s1a subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The recently proposed vacA genotyping system is applicable to Japanese H pylori strains and most strains have the s1a genotype, associated with increased virulence. While the high frequency of s1a/m1 vacA genotype might play a role in the increased incidence of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer in Japanese subjects, it precludes its use as a predictor of clinical outcome of H pylori infection in Japan.

TI  - Differentiation of F18ab+ from F18ac+ Escherichia coli by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the major fimbrial subunit gene (fedA).  
AB  - Toxin-producing Escherichia coli expressing F18 fimbriae colonizes the small intestines of weaned pigs and causes diarrhea, edema disease, or both. The F18 family is composed of two antigenic variants, F18ab and F18ac. Because many strains do not express F18 fimbriae in vitro, identification and differentiation of these two variants are difficult. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a rapid method for identifying genetic mutations and polymorphisms. The F18 major fimbrial subunit genes (fedA) of 138 strains were amplified by PCR, and genetic differences were detected by SSCP analysis. The SSCP analysis of the fedA gene differentiated F18ab+ strains from F18ac+ strains. Most strains classified as F18ab+ by SSCP analysis contained Shiga toxin 2e and enterotoxin genes. Most strains classified as F18ac+ by SSCP analysis contained only enterotoxin genes. The SSCP analysis was a useful method for predicting the antigenicity of F18+ E. coli and could also be used for analysis of other virulence genes in E. coli and other pathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Genotypic characterization of Bradyrhizobium strains nodulating endemic woody legumes of the Canary Islands by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of genes encoding 16S rRNA (16S rDNA) and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacers, repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR genomic fingerprinting, and partial 16S rDNA sequencing.  
AB  - We present a phylogenetic analysis of nine strains of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from nodules of tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus) and other endemic woody legumes of the Canary Islands, Spain. These and several reference strains were characterized genotypically at different levels of taxonomic resolution by computer-assisted analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs), 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) RFLPs, and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) genomic fingerprints with BOX, ERIC, and REP primers. Cluster analysis of 16S rDNA restriction patterns with four tetrameric endonucleases grouped the Canarian isolates with the two reference strains, Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110spc4 and Bradyrhizobium sp. strain (Centrosema) CIAT 3101, resolving three genotypes within these bradyrhizobia. In the analysis of IGS RFLPs with three enzymes, six groups were found, whereas rep-PCR fingerprinting revealed an even greater genotypic diversity, with only two of the Canarian strains having similar fingerprints. Furthermore, we show that IGS RFLPs and even very dissimilar rep-PCR fingerprints can be clustered into phylogenetically sound groupings by combining them with 16S rDNA RFLPs in computer-assisted cluster analysis of electrophoretic patterns. The DNA sequence analysis of a highly variable 264-bp segment of the 16S rRNA genes of these strains was found to be consistent with the fingerprint-based classification. Three different DNA sequences were obtained, one of which was not previously described, and all belonged to the B. japonicum/Rhodopseudomonas rDNA cluster. Nodulation assays revealed that none of the Canarian isolates nodulated Glycine max or Leucaena leucocephala, but all nodulated Acacia pendula, C. proliferus, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Vigna unguiculata.

TI  - Vacuolating toxin production in clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori with different vacA genotypes.  
AB  - A vacuolating cytotoxin encoded by vacA in Helicobacter pylori is known as a potential virulent determinant. The relationship between different vacA alleles, vacuolating ability, and H. pylori-related diseases was investigated. Genetic analysis of 119 isolates from Taiwanese patients revealed that 104 strains were s1a/m2, 13 strains were characterized as the s1a/m1T type, which was more homologous to the s1a/m1 strains, and 2 were characterized as the s1a/m1Tm2 chimeric type. Production of high-grade cytotoxin among 11 strains with s1a/m1T was higher (72.7%) than among 66 strains with s1a/m2 (21.2%) (P < .01). Peptic ulcer occurred in 76.9% of 13 patients with s1a/m1T strains compared with 46.2% of 104 patients with s1a/m2 strains (P < .05). These results suggest that s1a/m1T strains are associated with increased cytotoxic activity and higher ulcer prevalence than are s1a/m2 strains.

TI  - Escherichia coli genes expressed preferentially in an aquatic environment.  
AB  - Enteric bacteria are frequently found in aquatic environments, where they may pose a risk to human health. Although bacterial survival and persistence in such habitats has been studied extensively, there is almost no information about bacterial adaptation to these conditions at the level of changes in gene expression. As a first exploration of this field, we have carried out a screen designed to identify Escherichia coli genes that show increased expression in an aquatic environment. The screen was performed by subtractive hybridization on a genomic library and led to the identification of several RNA species more abundant in cells inoculated in this medium than in stationary-phase cultures after growth in rich medium. The genes identified include specific tRNA operons and a gene of unknown function, gapC, with similarities to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases.  E. coli K-12 strains appear to have accumulated mutations in gapC, which may impede its translation, whereas natural isolates have an intact gapC gene. Sequence comparison of gapC with related genes suggests its acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Isolation and molecular analysis of colonising and non-colonising strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli following experimental infection of young chickens.  
AB  - Fourteen-day-old chickens were inoculated with selected Campylobacter coli and C. jejuni strains. C. jejuni strains were of two subgroups based on a polymorphism detected using a DNA probe and represented the profiles typical for the majority of strains of either chicken or human origin. All C. coli strains previously isolated from humans colonised chickens, whereas from 4/7 C. jejuni strains of human origin, failed to colonise. Of 12 Campylobacter strains of chicken origin, 10 established a persistent colonisation in the chickens, and 2 strains colonised poorly or not at all. Four strains that failed to colonise chickens were each inoculated into groups of five birds. Three strains again did not colonise any of the chickens and the fourth strain colonised four out of the five chickens, but was poorly excreted. When infected chickens were placed in the same enclosure to facilitate interchange of strains, C. jejuni strain 331 was found to be dominant and colonised all 12 chickens by 21 days, displacing all other strains. C. jejuni strain 331, was then inoculated into groups of five birds with previously established colonisation by C. jejuni and C. coli strains. Strain 331 was able to replace the C. jejuni strain in all five birds but established co-colonisation with C. coli strain. Naturally occurring co-colonisation by two C. jejuni strains was detected in one chicken out of 200 tested. There was no obvious correlation between the type of DNA polymorphism in strains of chicken origin and their ability to colonise chickens.

TI  - Degradation of histamine and tyramine by Brevibacterium linens during surface ripening of Munster cheese.  
AB  - Red smear formation during fermentation of Munster cheese was started by using three different strains of Brevibacterium linens as surface inocula. The cheeses were produced with and without supplementation of histamine and tyramine. After smearing the cheese surface for the first time with B. linens viable counts of 10(7) CFU/g were detected. At the end of the logarithmic growth phase cell numbers increased to 10(10) CFU/g and remained constant during the whole ripening period. During a 4-week ripening period strains of B. linens reduced histamine and tyramine content by 55 to 70%. B. linens LTH 456 and LTH 3686 degraded histamine and tyramine in a phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 0.54 M histamine and 0.58 M tyramine when incubated with agitation at 30 degrees C. B. linens LTH 3813 did not reveal any amine degradation activity in a buffer system. The pH on the cheese surface increased from 5 to 7, whereas it increased in the center only to 5.3 after a 3-week ripening period.

TI  - Ecto-nucleotide triphosphatase activity in pathogenic and non-pathogenic Entamoeba: protection from the cytotoxic effects of extracellular ATP.  
AB  - The nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity of Entamoeba species and of Entamoeba histolytica strains, was compared. In all cases, with the exception of Entamoeba moshkovskii, the enzyme was activated by Ca2+ and not by Mg2+ and preferentially hydrolysed UTP with decreasing activity for ATP and GTP. The NTPase activity was associated with both the intracellular and the plasma membrane sulphonylbenzoyl-adenosine (FSBA) of trophozoites in which the ATP-site was facing externally, as shown by fluoroinhibition of NTPase activity and protection by the substrate added prior to FSBA. The highest surface activity was found in Entamoeba invadens and in the virulent E. histolytica HM1-A clone (HM1-IMSS passaged thrice through hamster liver). Significant lower activity was observed in non-pathogenic Entamoeba spp. The addition of ATP to cultures of pathogenic amoebae resulted in cell growth inhibition and lysis. This deleterious effect of adding ATP to the cultures was reversed by the addition of Ca2+. ATP hydrolysis by the amoeba may alter extracellular ATP-dependent processes in the host, which may be important for the survival of the amoeba in vivo.

Methylammonium uptake was assayed in these strains and in other mutant strains in which the regulation of nitrogen metabolism is impaired. Our data suggest that the AmtB protein is an ammonium transporter, which is mainly regulated by NtrC in response to nitrogen availability.

TI  - Cloning and expression of the Moraxella catarrhalis lactoferrin receptor genes.  
AB  - The lactoferrin receptor genes from two strains of Moraxella catarrhalis have been cloned and sequenced. The lfr genes are arranged as lbpB followed by lbpA, a gene arrangement found in lactoferrin and transferrin receptor operons from several bacterial species. In addition, a third open reading frame, orf3, is located one nucleotide downstream of lbpA. The deduced lactoferrin binding protein A (LbpA) sequences from the two strains were found to be 99% identical, the LbpB sequences were 92% identical, and the ORF3 proteins were 98% identical. The lbpB gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from a third strain of M. catarrhalis, and the encoded protein was found to be 77% identical and 84% similar to the other LbpB proteins. Recombinant LbpA and LbpB proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli, and antisera raised to the purified proteins were used to assess antigenic conservation in a panel of M. catarrhalis strains. The recombinant proteins were tested for the ability to bind human lactoferrin following gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, and rLbpB, but not rLbpA, was found to bind lactoferrin. Bactericidal antibody activity was measured, and while the anti-rLbpA antiserum was not bactericidal, the anti-rLbpB antisera were found to be weakly bactericidal. Thus, LbpB may have potential as a vaccine candidate.

TI  - Genetic determinant and environmental carcinogens.  
AB  - 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is the most abundant mutagenic heterocyclic amine (HCA) present in cooked foods. PhIP induces colon cancer in male Fischer 344 (F344) rats, and its role in human colon carcinogenesis has been suspected. To study the ecogenetics in PhIP colon carcinogenesis, rat system using aberrant crypt focus (ACF) formation as a phenotypic marker was applied. Among Buffalo (BUF), Brown Norway (BN), F344 and ACI/N (ACI) strains of rats, F344 rats produced a lower level of PhIP-DNA adducts than other three strains, and the number of ACFs/rat was highest in BUF, intermediate in BN and F344 and lowest in ACI. Thus there was no correlation between adduct levels and number of ACF induced by PhIP. F1 progenies of BUF and ACI developed ACF at a similar level to that of F344, and F1 progenies of F344 and ACI developed ACF at a similar level to that of F344. Thus it was indicated that susceptibility of F344 to the ACF induction was autosomally dominant over ACI rats. The results also suggest that BUF rats have at least two genes, one is autosomally recessive against ACI rats and one is autosomally dominant similar to that F344 has. A total of 170 progeny of ACI backcross of F344/ACI F1 were examined for number of ACFs and 65 progeny were phenotyped as F344 and 60 were ACI. Using these 125 rats, chromosomal mapping is being performed using markers of simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) and representational difference analysis (RDA). By mapping the gene, we will be able to identify humans who might belong to high risk group in general population, and cancer can be prevented more efficiently by attaining early diagnosis.

TI  - Thermal inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolated from ground beef and bovine feces, and suitability of media for enumeration.  
AB  - Rates of thermal inactivation of five strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 isolated from ground beef implicated in outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and five strains isolated from bovine feces were determined. Ground beef (22% fat, 10 g), inoculated with individual test strains at populations ranging from 6.85 to 7.40 log10 CFU g-1 of beef, was formed into patties (0.3 cm thick and 8.0 cm in diameter) and sealed in polyethylene bags. For each strain and treatment temperature (54.4, 58.9, 62.8, 65.6, or 68.3 degrees C), 6 bags were simultaneously immersed into a recirculating water bath. Viable cells in patties heated for various lengths of time were enumerated by plating diluted samples on sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide (MSMA) and modified eosin methylene blue (MEMB) agar. Regardless of strain or treatment temperature, higher numbers of E. coli O157:H7 cells were generally recovered on MEMB agar than on MSMA, indicating the inferiority of MSMA as a recovery medium for quantitative determination of E. coli O157:H7 cells in heat-processed ground beef. Significantly (P < or = 0.05) higher D values when enumeration was done using MEMB agar compared with MSMA. Mean D values for combined strain data at 54.4, 58.9, 62.8, and 65.6 degrees C from cultures on MEMB agar were 123.90, 6.47, 0.62, and 0.20 min, respectively, whereas D values of 25.5, 5.21, and 0.18 min were obtained at the same temperatures from cultures on MSMA. Results suggest that cooking ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 68.3 degrees C for 40 s will inactivate at least 99.99% of E. coli O157:H7 cells; z values of 4.0 and 5.1 degrees C were calculated from mean D values obtained from MEMB agar and MSMA, respectively, as recovery media. Differences in D values existed among strains but rates of thermal inactivation do not appear to be correlated with the sources of the isolates.

TI  - Hamstring strains in athletes: diagnosis and treatment.  
AB  -  Hamstring strains are among the most common injuries (and reinjuries) in athletes. Studies combining electromyography with gait analysis have elucidated the timing of activity of the three muscles of the hamstring group; they function during the early-stance phase for knee support, during the late-stance phase for propulsion, and during midswing to control the momentum of the leg. Muscle injury, whether partial or complete, occurs at the myotendinous junction, where force is concentrated. The healing response begins with inflammation, associated edema, and localized hemorrhage. After an initial period of reduced tension, the healing muscle regains strength rapidly as long as reinjury does not occur. Although the use of anti-inflammatory medication is a keystone of treatment, a certain degree of inflammation is necessary for removing necrotic muscle fibers and rescaffolding to allow optimal recovery. The protocol of rest, ice, compression, and elevation is still the preferred first-aid approach. After a brief period of immobilization (usually less than 1 week for even the most severe strain), mobilization is begun to properly align the regenerating muscle fibers and limit the extent of connective tissue fibrosis. Concurrent pain-free stretching and strengthening exercises (beginning with isometrics and progressing to isotonics and isokinetics) are essential to regain flexibility and prevent further injury and inflammation. Readiness for return to competition can be assessed by isokinetic testing to confirm that muscle-strength imbalances have been corrected, the hamstring-quadriceps ratio is 50% to 60%, and the strength of the injured leg has been restored to within 10% of that of the unaffected leg. The only indication for surgery is a complete rupture at or near the origin from the ischial tuberosity or distally at its insertion (either soft-tissue avulsion with a large defect or bone avulsion with displacement by 2 cm).

TI  - A common polygenic basis for quinine and PROP avoidance in mice.  
AB  - Inbred strains of mice (Mus musculus) differ greatly in ability to taste various bitter compounds. For some compounds, the differences result from allelic variation at a single locus. However, segregation patterns incompatible with monogenic inheritance have been found for quinine avoidance. The Soa bitter sensitivity locus exerts some influence on this phenotype, but an unknown number of other loci also contribute. Relative avoidance patterns for quinine sulfate in panels of naive inbred strains resembled avoidance patterns for 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PROP), suggesting a common genetic basis. In particular, C57BL/6J mice strongly avoided both 0.1 mM quinine sulfate and 1 mM PROP in two-bottle preference tests, whereas C3H/HeJ mice were indifferent to both. Therefore, 12 BXH/Ty recombinant inbred strains, derived from these strains, were tested with both solutions to begin identification of the unknown bitter loci. Naive mice were tested for four consecutive days with each compound (order counterbalanced). Some BXH/Ty strain means resembled those of the parent strains, but others were intermediate. This indicated recombination among loci affecting avoidance, and therefore polygenic inheritance. The strain means were highly correlated across compounds (r = 0.98), suggesting that the same polygenes controlled both phenotypes. The BXH/Ty means for both compounds were then compared with the strain genotypes at 212 chromosome position markers distributed throughout the genome. Eight markers on five chromosomes (3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) yielded significant correlations. Six of the markers were correlated with both phenotypes, again suggesting common polygenic inheritance. The marker with the highest correlation was Prp, tightly linked to Soa on chromosome 6. The correlated marker regions likely contain quantitative trait loci affecting bitter avoidance. The phenotypic similarity of PROP to quinine, rather than to phenylthiourea, apparently stemming from a common polygenic basis, indicates a difference between mice and humans in gustatory organization related to bitters.

AB  - Vibrio cholerae O1 strains isolated mostly in Japan between 1977 and 1995 were typed according to restriction fragment patterns by cleavage of genomic DNA with Sfi I and Not I and separation by Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Two hundred sixty five strains from human were divided into 60 PFGE patterns (provisional types).  Strains of type 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 and 51-54 were dominant in the Philippines, Thailand, India and Indonesia, respectively. Types 1-1, 2-3, 2-53, and 3-4 were detected over a long period of time in contrast to the other types. Strains of the same type (Types 1-1, 2-3, 2-53 and others) isolated from the Japanese who had never been outside Japan were often found among strains from Southeast Asia. Most strains from humans were cholera-toxin (CT)-positive, while those from the environment and the sea were generally not. 23 strains from the environment and the sea in Japan were divided into 12 types. Strains of the same types as CT-positive strains from humans could not be found in the environment and sea. These results suggest that cholera in Japan is closely related with cholera in Southeast Asia and PFGE is useful for epidemiological analysis of cholera in Japan.

AB  - Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from different sources, i.e. 1 strain (AA1) from an aquatic environment, 1 strain from normal flora (118310) and the type strain (ATCC 25285) originally isolated from clinical material, were analysed for both cell envelope proteins composition and surviving under oxidative stress starvation. All strains examined showed a similar survival response when cultured in drinking water with a ten-fold decrease in viable counts per day during the 7 days of analysis. The outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of all strains were quite similar during the stress period as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). However, the periplasmic proteins of the strain 118310 showed two protein bands at 48 and 58 kDa, respectively, that were absent in the strains AA1 and ATCC 25285 during the incubation period in potable water. Whole cells and periplasmic 35S-labelled proteins from bacteria cultured in drinking water showed a significant increase in proteins at 16, 18, 24, 26, 35, 48, and 58 kDa and 18, 22, 24, 48, 58, and 70 kDa, respectively, in all strains when compared to cells grown in BHI-PRAS media as detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. These data suggest that B. fragilis may have a synthesis mechanism that allows them to adapt to adverse environments.

TI  - Subgenus classification of Acanthamoeba by riboprinting.  
AB  - Subgenus classification of Acanthamoeba remains uncertain. Twenty-three reference strains of Acanthamoeba including 18 (neo)type-strains were subjected for classification at the subgenus level by riboprinting. PCR/RFLP analysis of 18S rRNA gene (rDNA). On the dendrogram reconstructed on the basis of riboprint analyses, two type-strains (A. astronyxis and A. tubiashi) of morphological group 1 diverged early from the other strains and were quite distinct from each other. Four type-strains of morphological group 3, A. culbertsoni, A. palestinensis, A. healyi were considered taxonomically valid, but A. pustulosa was regarded as an invalid synonym of A. palestinensis. Strains of morphological group 2 were classified into 6 subgroups. Among them, A. griffini which has an intron in its 18S rDNA was the most divergent from the remaining strains. Acanthamoeba castellanii Castellani, A. quina Vil3, A. lugdunensis L3a, A. polyphaga Jones, A. triangularis SH621, and A. castellanii Ma strains belonged to a subgroup, A. castellanii complex. However, A. quina and A. lugdunensis were regarded as synonyms of A. castellanii. The Chang strain could be regarded as A. hatchetti. Acanthamoeba mauritaniensis, A. divionensis, A. paradivionensis could be considered as synonyms of A. rhysodes. Neff strain was regarded as A. polyphaga rather than as A. castellanii. It is likely that riboprinting can be applied for rapid identification of Acanthamoeba isolated from the clinical specimens and environments.

TI  - Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni from groundwater.  
AB  - A pollution event which occurred at a spring in the Arnside area of Cumbria provided an opportunity to investigate whether Campylobacter jejuni could be detected in groundwater. Hydrological evidence suggested that the source of contamination was a dairy farm situated within the hydrological catchment of the polluted spring. The microbiological quality of the polluted spring was monitored during intervals over the following 12 months and compared with others in the area. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated by filter enrichment of 500 ml and 100 ml filtered volumes of groundwater. It was not isolated in the absence of faecal indicator species. Some strains of Camp. jejuni from water had identical biotypes to strains isolated from the dairy herd. This paper reports the first isolation of Camp. jejuni from groundwater using cultural methods and supports the theory that groundwater may be a vehicle for Campylobacter transmission.

TI  - Epidemiological markers in Neisseria meningitidis: an estimate of the performance of genotyping vs phenotyping.  
AB  - In order to estimate the performance of genotypic vs phenotypic characterization of Neisseria meningitidis, 2 methods, DNA fingerprinting and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MEE), were assessed as regards applicability, reproducibility and discriminating capacity. 50 serogroup B and 52 serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis strains from 96 patients with meningococcal disease and 22 serogroup C strains from healthy carriers were investigated. Both methods were 100% applicable to meningococcal strains and results of DNA fingerprinting as well as of MEE were reproducible. The number of types defined by DNA fingerprinting and MEE as compared to that defined by phenotypic characteristics (serogroup, serotype, serosubtype and sulphonamide resistance) was as follows: for serogroup B strains from patients, 11 and 12 vs 8; for serogroup C strains from patients, 10 and 15 vs 8; and for serogroup C carrier strains, 12 and 19 genotypes vs 10 phenotypes were defined. By use of both DNA fingerprinting and MEE the number of genotypes defined for the 3 groups of strains was 14, 17 and 19, respectively. DNA fingerprinting and MEE showed a discriminating capacity superior to that of phenotyping, and as applied in the study MEE was superior to DNA fingerprinting. Clusters of invasive strains were reliably identified by phenotyping alone, whereas determination of identity of carrier strains and an invasive strain required genotyping.

TI  - Identification of a gene unique to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and application to diagnosis of paratuberculosis.  
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is the etiologic agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease), a chronic granulomatous enteritis in ruminants. Currently, there is a need for improved diagnostic tests because of the lack of methods for accurate, rapid and reliable detection of M. paratuberculosis infection. A M. paratuberculosis gene (hspX) was cloned, sequenced, and a 30 bp species-specific oligonucleotide was synthesized. As an internal control to identify mycobacterial strains, a 33 bp Mycobacterium genus-specific oligonucleotide was synthesized based on the conserved 5' terminus of the mycobacterial recA gene. Dioligonucleotide hybridization (dOH) analysis identified 28/28 (100%) mycobacterial strains and specifically identified 14/14 (100%) reference (ATCC 19698), bovine, ovine and human isolates of M. paratuberculosis. The M. paratuberculosis-specific oligonucleotide distinguished M. paratuberculosis isolates from related mycobacteria, including all closely related members of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) tested in this study. The members of MAC tested in this study included Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium (M. paratuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium subspecies silvaticum (M. silvaticum) and Mycobacterium intracellulare strains. Hybridization was not observed with DNA extracted from a selected group of other bacterial pathogens. The experiments indicate that the dOH analysis is a useful diagnostic tool to detect mycobacterial infection, specifically M. paratuberculosis. The dOH method could be a good alternative to existing assays and will be adapted for specific identification of M. paratuberculosis from faecal samples, mixed bacteriologic cultures, tissue specimens and whole blood.

TI  - Vibrio pectenicida sp. nov., a pathogen of scallop (Pecten maximus) larvae.  
AB  - Five strains were isolated from moribund scallop (Pecten maximus) larvae over 5 years (1990-1995) during outbreaks of disease in a hatchery (Argenton, Brittany, France). Their pathogenic activity on scallop larvae was previously demonstrated by experimental exposure. The phenotypic and genotypic features of the strains were identical. The G + C content of the strains was in the range 39-41 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization showed a minimum of 73% intragroup relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences confirmed that these strains should be affiliated within the family Vibrionaceae and that they are closely related to Vibrio tapetis and Vibrio splendidus. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses revealed that the isolates were distinct from these two vibrios and so constitute a new species in the genus Vibrio. They utilized only a limited number of organic substrates as sole carbon sources, including betaine and rhamnose, but did not utilize glucose and fructose. In addition, their responses were negative for indole, acetoin, decarboxylase and dihydrolase production. The name Vibrio pectenicida is proposed for the new species; strain A365 is the type strain (= CIP 105190T).

TI  - A novel toxinotyping scheme and correlation of toxinotypes with serogroups of Clostridium difficile isolates.  
AB  - Two hundred nineteen Clostridium difficile isolates from 22 serogroups were screened for changes in the genes coding for toxin B (tcdB) and toxin A (tcdA). Parts of the toxin genes were amplified, and the PCR fragments were checked for length polymorphisms and cut with several restriction enzymes to monitor restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). For 47 strains (21%), differences in the toxin genes were found compared to the toxin genes of reference strain VPI 10,463. Polymorphisms were usually observed in both toxin genes. RFLPs were more commonly found in the tcdB gene, in which a single restriction enzyme could give up to five different patterns. Restriction sites seemed to be less heterogeneous in the tcdA gene, in which for most enzymes only two different RFLPs were recognized. However, deletions were observed in tcdA, and four new types of shortened tcdA genes are described. According to the changes in their toxin genes, variant strains could be divided into 10 groups (toxinotypes I to X). A toxinotype was characterized by similar patterns of changes in the toxin genes and in other regions of the pathogenicity locus and also similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Variant toxinotypes were found in 9 of the 22 serogroups studied, and some toxinotypes were clearly associated with specific serogroups. Toxinotype VIII is characteristic for all strains of serogroup F. Other serogroups in which variant toxinotypes were commonly found are A1, A15, E, and X. Testing of variability in C. difficile toxin genes not only might be useful as a molecular typing system but also could have implications in diagnostics and pathogenesis.

TI  - Random amplification of polymorphic DNA and microsatellite genotyping of pre- and posttreatment isolates of Candida spp. from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients on different fluconazole regimens.  
AB  - Twelve patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and with CD4 cell counts below 100 cells/microliter received fluconazole daily (200 mg; five patients) or weekly (400 mg; seven patients) for fungal prophylaxis during a 6-month period. Oropharyngeal swabs were taken at regular intervals in order to detect colonization with Candida spp. All yeast isolates were examined with respect to the development over time of fluconazole resistance. Genetic diversity among the strains was assessed in order to discriminate between selection of a resistant subclone and patient recolonization. Genotyping was performed through random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Specific site polymorphisms were assayed by tracking length variability in several microsatellite loci. Finally, to maximize resolution, one of these loci (ERK1) was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. Although the number of strains analyzed was too small to allow statistical verification, it appeared that when fluconazole was given weekly, a smaller fraction of the strains showed diminished sensitivity than when it was given daily. Genetic analyses allowed three different scenarios to be discerned. Resistance development in an otherwise apparently unchanged strain was seen for 1 of the 12 patients. Clear strain replacement was observed for 3 of the remaining 11 patients. For all other patients minor differences were seen in either the RAPD genotype or the microsatellite allele composition during the course of treatment. In general, microsatellite sequence data is in agreement with data obtained by other methods, but occasionally within-patient heterogeneity is indicated. The present results show that during fluconazole treatment colonizing strains can remain identical, be replaced by clearly different strains, or undergo small changes. Within a patient there may be different levels of intrastrain variation.

Eight additional strains isolated in the United States gave four distinct types of genomic PFGE profiles. All four types were different from that of T. equigenitalis NCTC11184T or that of the Japanese strain. The profile of three strains of one type was identical to that of Kentucky 188.

TI  - Bactericidal effect of levofloxacin on strains with equal susceptibility in an in vitro urinary bladder model.  
AB  - The in vitro bactericidal effects of therapeutic concentrations of levofloxacin (LVFX) on clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed. Starting from 10(7) CFU/ml, the bacterial count was determined serially during the exposure to LVFX present at concentrations automatically simulated to its clinically achievable urinary levels at the recommended dosage (100 mg 3 times daily). An isolate of P. aeruginosa for which the MIC of LVFX was 16 microgram/ml was completely eradicated after 10 h of exposure to LVFX. On the other hand, 40 h of exposure to LVFX were required for complete eradication of an isolate of E. faecalis with equal susceptibility, although the bacterial count was rapidly reduced to 10(2) CFU/ml in the early phase of the exposure. It was concluded that LVFX exerts a more potent bactericidal effect on P. aeruginosa than on E. faecalis despite a similar susceptibility of these organisms to LVFX.

TI  - Prevalence of bovine verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli in Argentina.  
AB  - Faecal swabs obtained from 126 calves and 118 cows in Argentina were investigated for the presence of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). VTEC strains were recovered from 10 (23%) of 43 calves with diarrhoea, from 24 (29%) of 83 healthy calves, from 40 (44%) of 91 healthy cows waiting at the slaughterhouse, and from 6 (22%) of 27 healthy grazing cattle. PCR showed that 21 (9%) of animals carried VT1+ strains, 49 (20%) VT2+ strains and 10 (4%) VT1+ VT2+ strains.  VT1+ strains predominated among calves (16% versus 0.8%; p < 0.001). The presence of eae gene was significantly more frequent among VTEC strains isolated from calves (78%; 46/59) than from cows (2%; 1/65) (p < 0.001). Furthermore, eae gene was more prevalent in VT1+ strains (97%; 32/33) than in VT2+ strains (14%; 10/70) (p < 0.001) and in VT1+ VT2+ strains (24%; 5/21) (p < 0.001). Sorbitol negative high virulent strains serogroups O157 were not detected. This study indicates that cattle are a reservoir of VTEC strains, and that eae gene is associated with VT1+ strains that are predominating among young animals. Fortunately, only adult animals are taken to the slaughterhouse, among which VTEC strains negative for eae gene are predominating.

TI  - Identification of common dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) using polymerase chain reactions.  
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting detected DNA polymorphisms among frequently isolated species and strains of the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton. The patterns generated by this DNA-based method permitted species and strains to be identified. The conventional methods to identify dermatophytes rely on the expression of characteristic morphological features, as well as several physiological properties. Identification is often delayed or problematic because isolates may be slow to form conidia or produce atypical microscopic structures or colony appearances. Using non-specific primers such as (AC)10, (GTG)5, M13 core sequence and AP3, characteristic PCR profiles were generated for 17 species. Intraspecies variables were also observed for four of six varieties of T. mentagrophytes, whereas no detectable DNA variability was found within the three varieties of T. tonsurans. Comparing species-specific PCR fingerprints of clinical isolates with those of type strains, species could be identified by their PCR fingerprints, even if they could not be identified by the accepted phenotypic characteristics.

TI  - Characterization of IS1245 for strain typing of Mycobacterium avium.  
AB  - IS1245 is an insertion element widely prevalent among isolates of Mycobacterium avium. We used PvuII Southern blots to analyze IS1245 polymorphisms among 159 M. avium isolates (141 clinical isolates from 40 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients plus 18 epidemiologically related environmental isolates) that represented 40 distinct M. avium strains, as resolved by previous studies by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All 40 strains carried DNA homologous to IS1245 and thus were typeable. Twenty-five (63%) strains had > or = 10 copies of the element, 6 (15%) had 4 to 9 copies, and 9 (23%) had only 1 to 3 copies. Among the last group of nine strains (each of which was distinct by PFGE analysis), IS1245 typing resolved only four patterns and thus provided poor discriminatory power. To evaluate the in vivo stability of IS1245, we analyzed 32 strains for which sets of 2 to 19 epidemiologically related isolates were available. For 19 (59%) of these sets, all isolates representing the same strain had indistinguishable IS1245 patterns. Within eight (25%) sets, one or more isolates had IS1245 patterns that differed by one or two fragments from the modal pattern for the isolates of that strain. Five (16%) sets included isolates whose patterns differed by three or more fragments; on the basis of IS1245 typing those isolates would have been designated distinct strains. IS1245 was stable during in vitro passage, suggesting that the variations observed represented natural translocations of the element. IS1245 provides a useful tool for molecular strain typing of M. avium but may have limitations for analyzing strains with low copy numbers or for resolving extended epidemiologic relationships.

TI  - Differences in the prevalence of IS6110 insertion sites in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains: low and high copy number of IS6110.  
AB  - SETTING: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates from various parts of the USA which have few copies of the insertion sequence IS6110. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the sites of insertion of IS6110 among M. tuberculosis isolates that have one to six copies of the insertion sequence. DESIGN: The mixed-linker polymerase chain reaction (ML-PCR) procedure was used to amplify the terminal repeats on the ends of IS6110 and adjacent flanking sequences. From the ML-PCR products, sequences flanking 14 copies of IS6110 in strains containing less than seven copies of the insertion were determined. Sequence information from the flanking deoxyribonucleic acid was used to construct flanking primers that can be used to indicate the presence of IS6110 at a particular site when paired with outbound IS6110 primers in a PCR. Over 200 strains of diverse origin were screened for the insertion of IS6110 at several distinct sites using this procedure. RESULTS: The direct repeat (DR) locus has been described as a highly preferred site for insertion of IS6110 in strains of M. tuberculosis. Another highly preferred site of insertion of IS6100, DK1, is herein described. Insertions at DK1 are highly prevalent in M. tuberculosis strains harboring two to six copies of IS6110. The prevalence of insertions at this site decreases in strains with more than six copies of IS6110, even though the sequence itself is present in strains lacking a copy of IS6110 at this site. CONCLUSION: In addition to the DR locus there are other conserved sites of insertion among M. tuberculosis strains. The data further suggest a separate lineage for the high copy and the low copy strains, and a possible sequential insertion of IS6110 in strains of M. tuberculosis with less than seven copies.

AB  - The production of Pertussis Vaccine was reevaluated at the Instituto Nacional de Higiene "Rafael Rangel" in order to optimise it in terms of vaccine yield, potency, specific toxicity and efficiency (cost per doses). Four different processes, using two culture media (Cohen-Wheeler and Fermentacion Glutamato Prolina-1) and two types of bioreactors (25 L Fermentador Caracas and a 450 L industrial fermentor) were compared. Runs were started from freeze-dried strains (134 or 509) and continued until the obtention of the maximal yield. It was found that the combination Fermentacion Glutamato Prolina-1/industrial fermentor, shortened the process to 40 hours while consistently yielding a vaccine of higher potency (7.91 +/- 2.56 IU/human dose) and lower specific toxicity in a mice bioassay. In addition, the physical aspect of the preparation was rather homogeneous and free of dark aggregates. Most importantly, the biomass yield more than doubled those of the Fermentador Caracas using the two different media and that in the industrial fermentor with the Cohen-Wheeler medium. Therefore, the cost per doses was substantially decreased.

By comparing the difference of log relative light units (RLUs) M. tuberculosis cultures incubating in the presence and absence of INH, INH susceptibility could be determined with the AE-DNA probe after three to five days of incubation. The difference of log RLUs of susceptible strains was statistically significantly lower than that for resistant strains after incubation for three to five days. The cutoff value was defined as "mean + one standard deviation" of the difference between log RLU(INH) and log RLU(no INH) on Day 5. By this criterion, agreement between the AE-DNA probe and the proportion concentration method was found in 19 of 20 susceptibility tests (95%). The AE-DNA probe test is rapid and non-isotopic, and may provide a useful alternative method for INH susceptibility testing for clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.
