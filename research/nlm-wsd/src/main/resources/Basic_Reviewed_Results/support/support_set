AB  - Thirty-two evaluable patients with squamous cell cancer of the cervix were treated with i.v. paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 over 3 h every 21 days. They received standard premedications and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (5 micrograms/kg/day). Median (range) age was 49 (29-81) years and performance status Zubrod was 1 (0-2). One patient had a complete response and seven patients had a partial response (25%, 95% CI 8-38%). The median survival was 7.3 months. Granulocytopenia was brief and non-cumulative. G-CSF was used for a median (range) of 8 (1-15) days per cycle. In conclusion: paclitaxel is active in patients with squamous cell cancer of the cervix and is well tolerated in this dose schedule with G-CSF support.

TI  - Bifurcated stent-graft for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine bifurcated stent-graft implantation for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Fifty-seven patients were treated and followed with serial computed tomography scans for up to 3 years. Patients were allocated to three groups (first 20, second 20, last 17) according to when the repair was performed. Successful treatment is defined as exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation, based on contrast computed tomography. Success rates in the three groups were 55%, 70% and 100%. Perigraft leak (endoleak) was present on initial assessment in 4/20, 2/20 and 1/17. Two of these aneurysms ruptured early in the postoperative period. Thereafter, leaks were sought and treated aggressively. Kinking and thrombosis occurred in six of the first 20 patients, but did not occur in any of the last 37 patients, in whom the graft limbs were routinely stent-supported throughout. Infrarenal implantation in very a short neck (< 10 mm), or a thrombus-lined neck was associated with proximal stent migration. In conclusion, changes in patient selection and technique have led to a steady rise in the short-term success rate of the stent-grafted implantation.

This project investigated the effectiveness of 208 abutments designed and produced by Dental Imaging Associates and the 73 prostheses supported by them over a 2-year period. No complications were found in the single-tooth group, although the sample was small (n = 7). Only 8.17% of the 208 abutment screws became loose during the initial postloading period. Once retightened, 2.4% of the total loosened for the second time. Higher screw-loosening rates were found in maxillary restorations, while the inclusion of a distal cantilevered pontic produced a significant increase in maintenance requirements.

TI  - Factors predicting hypnotic analgesia in clinical burn pain.  
AB  - The use of hypnosis for treating pain from severe burn injuries has received strong anecdotal support from case reports. Controlled studies provide less dramatic but empirically sound support for the use of hypnosis with this problem. The mechanisms behind hypnotic analgesia for burn pain are poorly understood with this patient population, as they are with pain in general. It is likely that, whatever the mechanisms are behind hypnotic pain analgesia, patients with burn injuries are more receptive to hypnosis than the general population. This article postulates some variables that may account for this enhanced receptivity, including motivation, hypnotizability, dissociation, and regression.

TI  - Toluene-induced elevation of serum bile acids: relationship to bile acid transport.  
AB  - Raised concentrations of serum bile acids (SBA) following occupational exposure to a number of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents and after in vivo exposure of experimental animals to these substances have been reported in several studies in recent years. However, the widely used nonchlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, toluene, has not been critically examined for its effect on serum bile acids. Accordingly, the effect of in vivo treatment with toluene on SBA and its direct in vitro effects on the transport of bile acids by isolated rat hepatocytes were investigated in this study. In vivo treatment with toluene (2.3 mmol/kg body weight, ip, on each of 3 consecutive days) resulted in a significant rise in the serum concentrations of total and some individual bile acids while other parameters of hepatobiliary function were unaltered. Administration of a higher dose of solvent (9.2 mmol/kg body weight, i.p.) resulted in a further increase in total SBA levels together with a significant rise in serum activities of some liver enzymes. In vitro application of noncytotoxic doses of toluene in the vapor phase to hepatocytes isolated from untreated rats resulted in a significant inhibition of the initial rate-(V0)-of uptake of cholic acid (CA). Similarly, accumulation of CA and taurocholic acid (TC) over an extended incubation time by hepatocytes exposed to toluene was significantly inhibited. Kinetic analysis revealed a noncompetitive inhibition of CA uptake as suggested by a decline in Vmax and an unaltered K(m). In contrast, the initial rate of efflux of these substates and their continuous efflux from preloaded cells were unaffected by exposure to toluene. Thus, toluene exposure inhibited the transport and accumulation of bile acids by hepatocytes in a manner largely similar to that of halogenated solvents, and this inhibition could explain the raised SBA concentrations following in vivo exposure to this solvent. These findings are consistent with and provide mechanistic data to support previous studies where increased SBA levels (in the absence of any evidence of liver injury as measured by liver enzyme tests) were reported in workers following occupational exposure to this solvent. Additionally, in full agreement with our previous investigations in which SBA levels were found to be a sensitive biological marker of exposure to halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents, the data support a similar role for SBA on exposure to toluene as well.

TI  - Evidence against a major role of adenosine in oxygen-dependent regulation of erythropoietin in rats.  
AB  - This in vivo study investigated whether adenosine (ADO) plays a role in oxygen-dependent production of erythropoietin (EPO). Exposure of rats to 0.075% carbon monoxide (CO) for four hours was used as a stimulus for EPO production. To inhibit potential effects of ADO, rats were treated with the non-specific ADO antagonist theophylline, the selective ADO A1 receptor blockers DPCPX and KW-3902, the selective ADO A2 receptor blocker DMPX, and AOPCP, an inhibitor of 5'-ectonucleotidase, an ADO generating enzyme that is expressed on the surface of EPO producing cells. To stimulate ADO receptor activity, animals were treated with the selective ADO A1 and A2 receptor agonists CHA and CGS 21680, the ADO reuptake inhibitors dipyridamole and soluflazine and the ADO desaminase inhibitor EHNA. At doses known to interfere with ADO signal transmission in vivo, none of these substances either influenced EPO serum levels in normoxic rats or affected the approximately 30-fold rise in EPO serum levels and the increase in renal EPO mRNA after exposure to carbon monoxide. Continuous administration of theophylline to normoxic rats for seven days did not alter hematocrit, hemoglobin or EPO serum levels. Taken together, these experiments do not support the hypothesis that ADO plays an important role in the regulation of EPO production.

TI  - Comparison of archaeal and bacterial genomes: computer analysis of protein sequences predicts novel functions and suggests a chimeric origin for the archaea.  
AB  - Protein sequences encoded in three complete bacterial genomes, those of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium and Synechocystis sp., and the first available archaeal genome sequence, that of Methanococcus jannaschii, were analysed using the BLAST2 algorithm and methods for amino acid motif detection. Between 75% and 90% of the predicted proteins encoded in each of the bacterial genomes and 73% of the M. jannaschii proteins showed significant sequence similarity to proteins from other species. The fraction of bacterial and archaeal proteins containing regions conserved over long phylogenetic distances is nearly the same and close to 70%. Functions of 70-85% of the bacterial proteins and about 70% of the archaeal proteins were predicted with varying precision. This contrasts with the previous report that more than half of the archaeal proteins have no homologues and shows that, with more sensitive methods and detailed analysis of conserved motifs, archaeal genomes become as amenable to meaningful interpretation by computer as bacterial genomes. The analysis of conserved motifs resulted in the prediction of a number of previously undetected functions of bacterial and archaeal proteins and in the identification of novel protein families. In spite of the generally high conservation of protein sequences, orthologues of 25% or less of the M. jannaschii genes were detected in each individual completely sequenced genome, supporting the uniqueness of archaea as a distinct domain of life. About 53% of the M. jannaschii proteins belong to families of paralogues, a fraction similar to that in bacteria with larger genomes, such as Synechocystis sp. and Escherichia coli, but higher than that in H. influenzae, which has approximately the same number of genes as M. jannaschii. Certain groups of proteins, e.g. molecular chaperones and DNA repair enzymes, thought to be ubiquitous and represented in the minimal gene set derived by bacterial genome comparison, are missing in M. jannaschii, indicating massive non-orthologous displacement of genes responsible for essential functions. An unexpectedly large fraction of the M. jannaschii gene products, 44%, shows significantly higher similarity to bacterial than to eukaryotic proteins, compared with 13% that have eukaryotic proteins as their closest homologues (the rest of the proteins show approximately the same level of similarity to bacterial and eukaryotic homologues or have no homologues). Proteins involved in translation, transcription, replication and protein secretion are most closely related to eukaryotic proteins, whereas metabolic enzymes, metabolite uptake systems, enzymes for cell wall biosynthesis and many uncharacterized proteins appear to be 'bacterial'. A similar prevalence of proteins of apparent bacterial origin was observed among the currently available sequences from the distantly related archaeal genus, Sulfolobus. It is likely that the evolution of archaea included at least one major merger between ancestral cells from the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to the eukaryotic nucleocytoplasm.

TI  - The impact of HIV on emotional distress of infected women: cognitive appraisal and coping as mediators.  
AB  - This study examined the role of psychological factors as mediators of the impact of HIV-related stressors on emotional distress of a clinic-based sample of 264 HIV+ women. Based upon Lazarus and colleagues' cognitively oriented theory of stress and coping, causal modeling was used to test for mediating effects of cognitive appraisal (intrusive thoughts and perceived stigma) and coping variables (avoidance and fatalism) on emotional distress within the context of HIV-related stressors (functional impairment and work performance impairment). The findings supported the mediating effects of cognitive appraisal but not of the coping variables. Consistent with theory, the effect of HIV-related stressors on emotional distress was indirect through cognitive appraisal; however, there were no significant direct effects of HIV-related stressors, fatalism or avoidance on emotional distress. The causal model accounted for significant portions of variance in emotional distress (R2 = .49) and the model fit, as a whole, was more than adequate. The findings indicate that how HIV+ women think about HIV-related stressors is an important factor that may account for individual variability in the ability to maintain a sense of subjective well-being in the face of a devastating fatal disease.

TI  - Platelet morphology in patients with mechanical circulatory support.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mechanical circulatory support is a therapy for patients with end stage cardiac insufficiency. The thromboembolic events are feared complications during support, due to the surface thrombogenicity of the implanted device. Activated blood platelets play a major role in this context. Consequently the platelet morphology of patients was investigated. METHODS: Platelets of eight patients were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy during the period of support with the Novacor left ventricular assist system N100. Blood was collected preoperatively and daily during the first week as well as weekly during the first 3 months. Samples were fixed with cacodylic-acid buffered glutaraldehyde. Platelet alterations were classified as non-activated, activated and aggregated, based on the so-called 'shape change' morphology. In addition, blood coagulation parameters were evaluated (e.g. activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, antithrombin III). RESULTS: Preoperatively, 15.0 +/- 4.6% (overall mean values) of activated platelets were found. Within the first postoperative week, the mean level of activated platelets increased to 32.8 +/- 8.0% (P < 0.05). Comparing short- (< 30 days; n = 4) vs. long-period (> 30 days; n = 4) support, a significant difference of activated platelets was evaluated (24.3 +/- 3.3% vs. 34.8 +/- 3.4%, P = 0.004). A correlation was found between the values of activated clotting time and activated platelets. Specific platelet deformations and damages appeared during support, which could not be found preoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The platelet morphology showed alterations in all patients probably most strongly induced by the surface activation of the implanted device. These observations should be taken into consideration in management of postoperative anticoagulation therapy.

TI  - Sex differences in the regulation of embryonic brain aromatase.  
AB  - Oestrogen formed from androgen by aromatization plays a critical role in the sexual differentiation of the male brain and behaviour. A question which has still to be answered is what regulates the gender-specific changes in aromatase activity forming oestrogen during sensitive periods of brain growth. Using a primary cell culture technique and sexed embryos, we have shown that in the fetal mouse brain, oestrogen formation in the male is neuronal rather than glial and aromatase activity is regionally localized, being higher in the hypothalamus than in the cortex. The aromatase activity measured from cells in culture has the same enzyme binding affinity (apparent Km approximately 40 nM) as intact brain samples. Neurones developing in the embryonic male brain (embryonic day (ED) 15) contain higher aromatase activity (Vmax, 895 fmol/h/mg protein) than the female (Vmax, 604). Although a sex difference exists at early stages of embryonic development (ED 13), the embryonic aromatase system is regulated by steroids later in fetal development. The developing aromatase-containing neuroblasts probably form processes which connect to other aromatase neurones. Immunoreactive staining with an aromatase polyclonal antibody identifies an increase in numbers of aromatase-immunoreactive hypothalamic neuronal cell bodies following testosterone treatment. Testosterone treatment also causes both stimulation of neurite growth and branching as well as functional maturation of aromatase neurones. In particular, there is an increase in aromatase activity per neurone as well as a dramatic increase in the number of neurones expressing the enzyme. Both the functional and morphological changes depend on androgen receptor stimulation for several days in vitro. This conclusion is supported by colocalization studies which reveal a high number of fetal hypothalamic aromatase neurones co-expressing androgen receptor. We conclude that testosterone influences the growth of male hypothalamic neurones containing aromatase at a sensitive period of brain development. Endogenous steroid inhibitors of aromatase, probably formed within the neuroglia, also play a role in the control of oestrogen production. An endogenous 5alpha-reduced metabolite of testosterone, 5alpha-androstanedione, is almost as potent in inhibiting neuronal hypothalamic aromatase activity (Ki = 23 nM) as the synthetic non-steroidal inhibitors such as the imidazole, fadrozole, and the triazoles, arimidex and letrozole. It is clear that the oestrogen-forming capacity of the male hypothalamus has the special characteristics and plasticity of regulation which could affect brain differentiation at specific steroid-sensitive stages in ontogeny.

TI  - Fetal cardiorespiratory and neurobehavioral response to zidovudine (AZT) in the baboon.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of intravenous of zidovudine (AZT) at a dose and duration of infusion comparable to that used clinically on parameters reflective of fetal well-being. METHODS: Thirteen chronically instrumented noninfected baboons were monitored during intravenous infusions of AZT. Fetal cardiorespiratory activity and neurobehavioral function were assessed with 4-48-hour infusion of AZT to ten mothers (0.5-2.1 mg/kg per hour) and three fetuses (2-6 mg/h), which resulted in fetal plasma concentration of AZT of 194-3100 ng/ml. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the mean values in control periods, before and after infusion with values during infusion for parameters of fetal heart rate and rate variability (n = 7), breathing activity (n = 8), electroencephalographic activity (n = 8), and behavioral state (N = 7). No correlations were found with drug level. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between exposure of the fetal baboon to AZT and changes in parameters reflective of fetal condition suggests that comparable exposure of the human fetus during intravenous infusion of drug would not confound clinical monitoring used to assess fetal well-being. These findings supplement conclusions from clinical research in support of U.S. Public Health Service recommendations that intrapartum fetal monitoring be performed as clinically indicated, not specifically because pregnant patients are treated with intravenous AZT.

TI  - Effects of spatial configuration and number of fixations on Kanizsa triangle detection.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Illusory figures, created by the visual system between visualizing real objects, are probably caused by processes designed to segregate objects from background. Support ratio--that is, the ratio between the physically specified and total triangle side length--has been suggested to be the main spatial determinant for suprathreshold perception of a Kanizsa-type illusion. To test this scale invariance hypothesis at threshold, illusory figure perception was studied by determining the effects of inducer size and distance at various exposure durations and fixation strategies on the frequency of seeing (FoS) an illusory Kanizsa triangle. METHODS: The effect of various support ratios was studied in the first experiment by varying the intercenter distance between constant-size inducers viewed at various distances. In the second experiment, the effects of various exposure durations and fixation strategies were investigated; and the third experiment repeated the second one, with backward masking to control the processing time. In the fourth experiment, the magnification of the stimulus configuration was varied, with a support ratio that had yielded 100% FoS in the first experiment, to study the range of scale invariance in illusory figure perception. RESULTS: The support ratio was the main determinant for the perception of an illusory figure at various inducer sizes, exposure durations, and masking conditions when fixation was steady; FoS always increased from 0% to 100% with the support ratio of 0.30 to 0.37. However, free viewing, with and without masking, resulted in 100% illusory figure perception at all support ratios tested. Furthermore, when fixation was steady and support ratio and exposure duration were held constant, stimulus magnification reduced FoS from 100% to 0% at the smallest and largest stimulus sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The support ratio seems to be the main spatial determinant for illusory figure perception. However, scale invariance in Kanizsa triangle perception broke down in the smallest and largest configurations, probably because of the limitations of visual acuity and spatial integration, respectively. Integration of information from several fixations enhances FoS at small support ratios, emphasizing the importance of the binding process between separate fixations for illusory figure perception.

It traces the development of current antigay policies in the church in 1976-78 in response to the first openly gay candidate for the ministry, PLGC's efforts to overturn these policies at annual General Assemblies, the growth of the pro-gay More Light Churches movement among Presbyterian congregations, the increasing number of antigay ecclesiastical court cases, study and dialogue on lesbian and gay issues across the denomination, and controversies over same-gender marriage, all culminating in the 1996 General Assembly, which endorsed civil rights for lesbian and gay couples, but also voted to send the controversial issue of lesbian and gay ordination to the 171 regional presbyteries of the church for an up or down vote. The battle for lesbian and gay equity in the church may well continue decades longer.

AB  - Several experiments have demonstrated increased synapse number within the cerebellar cortex in association with motor skill learning but not with motor activity alone. The persistence of these synaptic changes in the absence of continued training was examined in the present experiment. Adult female rats were randomly allocated to either an acrobatic condition (AC) or a motor activity condition (MC). The AC animals were trained to traverse a complex series of obstacles, and each AC animal was pair-matched with an MC animal that traversed an obstacle-free runway. These animals were further assigned to one of three training conditions. Animals in the EARLY condition were trained for 10 consecutive days before being killed, animals in the DELAY, condition received the same 10 d of training followed by a 28 d period without training, and animals in the CONTINUOUS condition were trained for the entire 38 d. Unbiased stereological techniques were used to obtain estimates of the number of synapses per Purkinje cell within the cerebellar paramedian lobule. Results showed the AC animals to have significantly more synapses per Purkinje cell than the MC animals in all three training conditions. There were no differences in the number of synapses per Purkinje cell among the EARLY, DELAY, and CONTINUOUS conditions. These data demonstrate that both the motor skills and the increases in synapse number presumed to support them persist in the absence of continued training.

TI  - Biochemical characterization of the binding of echistatin to integrin alphavbeta3 receptor.  
AB  - Echistatin is a 49-amino-acid peptide belonging to the family of disintegrins that are derived from snake venoms and are potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. Integrin alphavbeta3 receptor plays a critical role in several physiological processes such as tumor-induced angiogenesis, tumor cell metastasis, osteoporosis and wound repair. In this study, we have characterized the binding of echistatin to purified integrin alphavbeta3 receptor and the form expressed on human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We show that both purified and membrane-bound integrin alphavbeta3 binds to echistatin with a high affinity, which can be competed efficiently by linear and cyclic peptides containing the RGD sequence. Previous studies have shown that alphavbeta3 binds to vitronectin in a nondissociable manner, whereas an RGD-containing peptide derived from vitronectin binds in a dissociable manner with a Kd of 9.4 x 10(-7) M. Our studies indicate that radiolabeled echistatin binds to alphavbeta3 in a nondissociable manner, similar to native echistatin. However, echistatin does not support the adhesion of 293 cells expressing alphavbeta3 receptor because of poor binding to plastic dishes and is a potent antagonist of the adhesion of these cells to vitronectin. These studies demonstrate that echistatin binding to alphavbeta3 is of high affinity and irreversible similar to vitronectin and provides an alternate ligand for high-throughput screening for alphavbeta3 antagonists.

The functional role of c-Abl in the response to DNA damage, however, remains unclear. The present studies demonstrate that cells expressing a dominant negative, kinase-inactive c-Abl (K-R) are resistant to killing by ara-C. The expression of c-Abl (K-R) blocked ara-C-induced apoptosis by a mechanism that is at least in part independent of the p53 tumor suppressor. Cells null for c-Abl also exhibited resistance to induction of apoptosis. These findings provide support for a pro-apoptotic function of c-Abl in the response to certain genotoxic drugs.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: The inflammatory properties of nucleus pulposus were assessed in biopsy samples from patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the inflammatory properties of the different types of disc herniation. BACKGROUND DATA: High levels of phospholipase A2 previously have been demonstrated in a small number of patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery. Phospholipase A2 is the enzyme responsible for the liberation of arachidonic acid from cell membranes at the site of inflammation and is considered to be the limiting agent in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are powerful mediators of inflammation. Cytokines are among the many agonists inducing phospholipase A2 activation. Several reports previously have demonstrated the difference in clinical appearance of different types of lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients undergoing surgery for lumbar disc herniation were investigated. During surgery the disc pathology of each patient was classified into one of three groups: bulging disc, contained herniation, and noncontained disc herniation. Also during surgery, biopsy samples were taken from the nucleus, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at -70 C until analyzed. RESULTS: No traces of interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor alpha were found in the biopsy samples. There was a significant difference in the levels of leukotriene B4 and thromboxane B2 in contained versus noncontained disc herniation, and the highest concentration was found in the noncontained disc herniation group. CONCLUSION: The results support the theory that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in sciatica because of lumbar disc herniation and indicate that the different types of disc herniation have different inflammatory properties.

TI  - Induction of dendritic cell differentiation by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in vitro from lineage phenotypes-negative c-kit+ murine hematopoietic progenitor cells.  
AB  - To elucidate the capacity of murine early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs), lineage phenotypes (Lin)-c-kit+ HPCs were highly purified from either wild-type or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor p55 (TNF-Rp55)-deficient mice. Upon culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) for 14 days, wild-type mouse Lin-c-kit+ HPCs did not exhibit characteristic features of DC such as sheet-like projections and veil processes. Moreover, these cells expressed a marginal level of DC markers such as DEC-205, CD86, and barely supported allogenic MLR. However, the addition of mouse TNFalpha generated a large number of cells with typical DC morphology, expression of high levels of Ia, DEC-205, CD86, and function of stimulating allogenic MLR. Moreover, a proportion of these mature DCs and thymic DCs expressed Thy-1 mRNA as well as Thy-1 antigen, whereas freshly isolated splenic DCs did not. These results suggested that DCs generated in our culture system phenotypically resemble thymic ones. In contrast, mouse TNFalpha failed to induce TNF-Rp55-deficient mice-derived Lin-c-kit+ HPCs to generate DCs with characteristic morphology, immunophenotype, and accessory function for T cells under the same culture conditions, suggesting a crucial role of TNF-Rp55 in TNFalpha-mediated DC differentiation from HPCs. Interestingly, human TNFalpha, which can bind to mouse TNF-Rp55 but not TNF-Rp75, was incapable to augment DC generation from wild-type mouse Lin-c-kit+ HPCs. Collectively, these results suggest that TNFalpha has a pivotal role in DC generation from murine early HPCs in collaboration with GM-CSF and SCF through the interaction of TNF-Rp55 and TNF-Rp75.

TI  - Establishing a postgraduate qualification in remote health care.  
AB  - The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) provides medical care for the scientists and support staff working on British scientific bases and research vessels in the Antarctic. The BAS directs significant resources towards medical research, so a doctor who does not complete the research component of the programme of training and medical duties represents a partially wasted investment. Additionally, the professional experience gained by the doctor is appropriate for a postgraduate qualification. For these reasons, the training, clinical placement and research undertaken by doctors were formalized as a masters degree in 1992. The objectives of the MSc degree were to optimize the benefits of the training and research for Antarctic doctors and their patients, and to improve the quality of the research output. In the three years before the degree was introduced, only 25% of doctors produced a useful research output. Following the introduction of the MSc, this figure rose to 88%.

TI  - Differential secretion of chemokines from peripheral blood in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women.  
AB  - The maintenance of a normal pregnancy is dependent on the delicate interaction between the endocrine and the immune systems. Cytokines are thought to play a key role in pregnancy by way of local modulation of the immune system at the level of peripheral leukocytes. This study examined the potential of peripheral venous blood cultures from pregnant women throughout gestation and from non-pregnant women to produce the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and RANTES. Significantly (P = < 0.001), higher levels of MCP-1 were released from peripheral blood cultures from pregnant women at term than during the first trimester or from women who were not pregnant. This could not be accounted for by differences in differential blood counts. Significantly higher levels (P = < 0.05) of MCP-1 were released from PBMC preparations from pregnant compared with non-pregnant women. No 'rebound' increase in MCP-1 was observed on withdrawing progesterone support to the PBMC preparations. MCP-1 was secreted predominately from CD14+ cells with those from pregnant women producing more than those from non-pregnant women. There was no statistical difference in release of IL-8 or RANTES from either peripheral blood or PBMC preparations from pregnant or non-pregnant women. IL-8 and RANTES were secreted from CD14+ and CD14- cells, respectively. The hypothesis proposed is that the monocytes are fundamentally different in pregnancy and that measurement of MCP-1 has the potential to act as a marker of pregnancy status.

AB  - The longterm influence of management systems on the locomotion of 17 dairy cows was investigated by high speed cinematography (100 frames/s) and kinematic analysis. Angular patterns and hoof trajectories of the left fore- and hindlimbs are presented and statistics made of occurring minimum and maximum angles. At the recording, 3 cows had been kept in tie-stalls (TI) and 6 cows in cubicles (CI) for a consecutive time of about 2.5 years while 8 cows had been kept on grass for about 3 months. Four of the grazing cows had earlier been kept in cubicles (CG) and 4 in tie-stalls (TG) during earlier off grazing seasons together with TI and CI cows. The CI cows had a smaller maximum angle of the elbow joint compared to TI, TG and CG cows. The hock joint angle of the CI cows was less flexed during the stance phase than in TI and CG cows while the minimum angle during the swing phase was greater in the TI and CI cows compared to TG and CG cows. Pastured cows (TG and CG) had a less pronounced flexion of the fetlock joint angle during the stance compared to cows kept indoors (TI and CI). The results suggest that slatted floor and lack of exercise during summer grazing may affect locomotion. This is indicated by restrictions in the movements of the elbow and hock joints and in less fetlock joint flexion at full support.

TI  - The tactual horizontal-vertical illusion depends on radial motion of the entire arm.  
AB  - We sought to clarify the causes of the tactual horizontal-vertical illusion, where vertical lines are overestimated as compared with horizontals in L and inverted-T figures. Experiment 1 did not use L or inverted-T figures, but examined continuous or bisected horizontal and vertical lines. It was expected that bisected lines would be perceived as shorter than continuous lines, as in the inverted-T figure in the horizontal-vertical illusion. Experiment 1 showed that the illusion could not be explained solely by bisection, since illusory effects were similar for continuous and bisected vertical and horizontal lines. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the illusory effects were dependent upon stimulus size and scanning strategy. Overestimation of the vertical was minimal or absent for the smallest patterns, where it was proposed that stimuli were explored by finger movement, with flexion at the wrist. Larger stimuli induce whole-arm motions, and illusory effects were found in conditions requiring radial arm motion. The illusion was weakened or eliminated in Experiment 4 when subjects were forced to examine stimuli with finger-and-hand motion alone, that is, their elbows were kept down on the table surface, and they were prevented from making radial arm motions. Whole-arm motion damaged performance and induced perceptual error. The experiments support the hypothesis that overestimation of the vertical in the tactual horizontal-vertical illusion derives from radial scanning by the entire arm.

TI  - Experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats: effect of intravenous alpha-alpha diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin on hypoperfusion and neuronal death.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodilution with diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin (DCLHb) ameliorates occlusive cerebral ischemia. However, subarachnoid hemoglobin has been implicated as a cause of cerebral hypoperfusion. The effect of intravenous DCLHb on cerebral perfusion and neuronal death after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage was evaluated. METHODS: Rats (n = 48) were anesthetized with isoflurane and subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by injecting 0.3 ml of autologous blood into the cistema magna. Each animal received one of the following regimens: Control, no hematocrit manipulation; DCLHb, hematocrit concentration decreased to 30% with DCLHb; or Alb, hematocrit concentration decreased to 30% with human serum albumin. The experiments had two parts, A and B. In part A, after 20 min, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed with 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography. In part B, after 96 h, in separate animals, the number of dead neurons was determined in predetermined coronal sections by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow was greater for the DCLHb group than for the control group; and CBF was greater for the Alb group than the other two groups (P < 0.05). In one section, CBF was 45.5 +/- 10.9 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) (mean +/- SD) for the control group, 95.3 +/- 16.6 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for the DCLHb group, and 138.1 +/- 18.7 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for the Alb group. The number of dead neurons was less in the Alb group (611 +/- 84) than in the control group (1,097 +/- 211), and was less in the DCLHb group (305 +/- 38) than in the other two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data support a hypothesis that hemodilution decreases hypoperfusion and neuronal death after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The data do not support the notion that intravascular molecular hemoglobin has an adverse effect on brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AB  - Many diseases are recognized to be the result of a changing society and related to nutrition, alcohol, smoking and, not least, stress. What is not overtly recognized is that many of these diseases are the results of a society that alienates people from themselves and each other and biomedicine is demonstrably unable to provide answers to this. Identifying the need for social answers to disease is part of the answer but if healing of people in the true sense of the word is to be achieved, spiritual dimensions of care are fundamentally important and a more healing approach is required which works to promote the body's self healing powers. Nurses have always had a healing role and this is currently being rediscovered. The essential spiritual aspects to this healing role calls for a new philosophy, an approach that needs the support of nurse education and nurse management. The movement towards a more therapeutic approach may be what underpins the current move into complementary therapies by qualified nurses, demonstrating their response to the dominant ideology of distancing and detachment so prevalent in the market economy of health.

TI  - Photoaffinity labeling of cytochrome P4501A1 with azidocumene: identification of cumene hydroperoxide binding region.  
AB  - Cumene hydroperoxide can support cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions in the absence of molecular oxygen, NADPH, and cytochrome P450-NADPH oxidoreductase. Its binding at the cytochrome P450 active site is governed by the structure of the cumene hydroperoxide binding region. In order to define the region of cytochrome P4501A1 at which cumene hydroperoxide binds, we prepared an analog of cumene hydroperoxide for use as a photoaffinity label. p-Azido-isopro-pylbenzene (azidocumene) and its tritiated derivative were photolyzed in water solution by uv light with a half-life of 29 s. The 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylatation catalyzed by P450 using the cumene hydroperoxide-supported system was strongly inhibited by the presence of the label. Covalent binding to the protein after photoactivation was blocked by 50% in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide. HPLC analysis after trypsin digestion of the labeled protein showed that [3H]-azidocumene was attached covalently to the peptide VDMTPAYGLTLK corresponding to residues 492-503 in the 1A1 sequence. The radioactivity level of this fraction was reduced by 50% when the labeling was carried out in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide. To confirm the identified region the labeled protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide. HPLC separation of the CNBr digest showed two peaks with a high level of radioactivity. The SDS/Tricine PAGE analysis of the radioactive fraction with an elution time of 43 min revealed a 2.4-kDa peptide carrying a high level of covalently bound radioactivity. The N-terminal sequence identified the labeled peptide to be a fragment generated by CNBr corresponding to residues 494-512. The N-terminal sequence of the labeled peptide with elution time of 27 min, TLKH, matches amino acid residues 501-504 in the P4501A1 sequence. We can conclude that in the overlapping region of all three identified peptides, T501-L502-K503, is the site where azidocumene covalently binds to P4501A1. The sequence alignment of cytochrome P4501A1 with cytochrome P450102 predicts that this region might correspond to beta-sheet structure localized on the distal side of the heme ring near the I helix and the oxygen binding pocket. To our knowledge, this is the first report to localize the cumene hydroperoxide binding region in the cytochrome P450 active site.

TI  - Redundant and selective roles for erythropoietin receptor tyrosines in erythropoiesis in vivo.  
AB  - Cytokine receptors have been shown in cell culture systems to use phosphotyrosine residues as docking sites for certain signal transduction intermediates. Studies using various cellular backgrounds have yielded conflicting information about the importance of such residues. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether or not tyrosine residues within the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) are essential for biologic activity during hematopoiesis in vivo. A variant of the EPOR was constructed that contains both a substitution (R129C) causing constitutive receptor activation as well as replacement of all eight cytoplasmic tyrosines by phenylalanines (cEPORYF). A comparison between animals exposed to recombinant retroviruses expressing cEPOR and cEPORYF showed that efficient red blood cell (RBC) development in vivo is dependent on the pressence of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR. In addition, an inefficient EPOR tyrosine independent pathway supporting RBC development was detected. Tyrosine add-back mutants showed that multiple individual tyrosines have the capacity to restore full erythropoietic potential to the EPOR as determined in whole animals. The analysis of primary erythroid progenitors transduced with the various cEPOR tyrosine mutants and tyrosine add-backs showed that only tyrosine 343 (Y1) and tyrosine 479 (Y8) were capable of supporting immature burst-forming unit-erythroid progenitor development. Thus, this receptor is characterized by striking functional redundancy of tyrosines in a biologically relevant context. However, selective tyrosine residues may be uniquely important for early signals supporting erythroid development.

TI  - Enhanced follicular dendritic cell function in lymph nodes of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques: consequences for pathogenesis.  
AB  - HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are characterized by several abnormalities in B cell function. Pathogenesis is also associated with marked changes within germinal centers (GC) including hypertrophy and degeneration of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and accumulation of both viral antigen and activated CD45RO+ CD8+ cells. Since FDC are critical to the generation of antibody-forming cells and specific B cell memory, the simplest assumption is that such B cell defects directly result from virus-induced changes in the GC environment. The present study examined FDC-enriched mesenteric lymph node lymphocyte preparations from early and late stage SIV-infected and uninfected macaques for their ability to support GC reactions in vitro. The results indicate that FDC function as measured by cluster formation, B cell proliferation and SIV-specific antibody production is enhanced in SIV-infected macaques suggesting that, despite FDC atrophy, virus accumulation induces increased FDC-B cell interactions resulting in B cell hyperactivity. The activation and proliferation of CD8+ cells in FDC-enriched cultures further suggest that the infiltrating CD8+ population observed in situ in GC of late-stage SIV/HIV-infected individuals may also benefit from FDC-derived growth signals. Thus, in addition to enhanced B cell proliferation and antibody production, hyperactivity of FDC may potentially promote their own self destruction via the infiltrating CD8+ cells. The increased B cell responsiveness may further exacerbate the disease process due to an overall decrease in the affinity of anti-HIV/SIV antibody, a loss of crucial protective antibodies to other infectious agents and the creation of an environment in which increased trapping of virions facilitates more extensive infection of CD4+ T cells.

TI  - Nitric oxide opposes phorbol ester-induced increases in pulmonary microvascular permeability in dogs.  
AB  - In addition to its effects on vascular tone, nitric oxide (NO) has been suggested to function as a participant in fluid homeostasis affecting interactions between the endothelium and circulating inflammatory cells. The role of NO in the increased microvascular permeability of acute lung injury, however, remains controversial. We investigated the hypothesis that NO opposes increases in pulmonary vascular permeability after phorbol myristate acetate administration, i.e., in a model of neutrophil-dependent acute lung injury. In anesthetized dogs, phorbol myristate acetate (10 microg/kg, i.v.) had no effect on pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) or extravascular lung water. After pretreatment with the NO synthesis inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10 mg/kg, i.v. ; 5 mg/kg/hr), an identical dose of phorbol myristate acetate resulted in a 20 +/- 8 mm Hg (P < .01) increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and a 186 +/- 86% (P < .01) increase in extravascular lung water. To determine if the pulmonary edema was related to increases in microvascular pressure or to changes in the microvascular permeability coefficient, experiments were performed in isolated blood-perfused dog lungs. The addition of phorbol myristate acetate (4.2 x 10(-8) M) to the perfusate was without effect on microvascular pressure or pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient. However, after NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 microM), phorbol myristate acetate resulted in increases in both microvascular pressure and permeability coefficient that were prevented by pretreatment with L-arginine (1 mM). These data support the hypothesis that endogenous NO opposes increases in pulmonary vascular permeability as well as microvascular pressure in this neutrophil-dependent model of acute lung injury resulting in preservation of the endothelial barrier to the passage of water and solutes and prevention of the formation of pulmonary edema.

TI  - Age and experience-dependent representational reorganization during spatial learning.  
AB  - Previously, we found that aged rats showed a significant enhancement of hippocampal CA1 place cell spatial specificity, as well as a reduction of hilar place cell spatial specificity, during asymptote performance of a spatial memory task. Because such an age effect was not observed when animals performed a nonspatial task, the present study tested the hypothesis that the different patterns of spatial selectivity observed in memory and nonmemory tests reflected a redistribution of spatial representations that occurred in response to changing task demands. In the present experiment, after animals became familiar with the test environment and motor demands of performance on a radial maze, CA1 and hilar place cells were recorded as they learned a spatial memory task. CA1 place cells recorded from unimpaired old, but not impaired old or young, animals became more spatially selective as animals learned the task. Hilar spatial selectivity for both age groups was not significantly related to choice accuracy. These data support the hypothesis that at least a subpopulation of aged rats may benefit from reorganization of spatial representations in such a way that the normal age-related spatial learning deficit is attenuated.

TI  - State health department and university evaluation of North Carolina's Maternal Outreach Worker Program.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Maternal Outreach Worker (MOW) Program is a social support intervention using lay helpers to provide support, health education, and outreach to Medicaid eligible women at risk for poor pregnancy and parenting outcomes. State Health Department and University collaborators designed a two-pronged evaluation comprised of programwide and interview study components to assess the impact of the program on pregnancy outcomes, health behaviors, and infant health status. METHODS: Programwide evaluation data are based on 1992-1995 N.C. birth files for the original 24 participating counties and include 1,726 MOW participant births and 12,988 comparison births whose records were linked to birth files and met the study criteria. For the interview study 373 MOW participants and 332 comparison women were personally interviewed three times: during pregnancy, one month postpartum, and one year after delivery. RESULTS: Risk factors associated with poor pregnancy and parenting outcomes were greater among MOW participants than comparisons in both the programwide and intensive study components. Caucasian MOW participants had slightly higher rates of adequate prenatal care. African Americans were found to have less adequate prenatal care. Fewer than expected LBW and VLBW births were observed for African-American MOW participants. MOW Program participation did not affect the utilization of health and social services for infants. African Americans, regardless of whether they received MOW services, fared better than Caucasians in terms of having their pregnancy needs fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show the need to further explore appropriate measures of maternity support program outcomes and indicate inconsistent program benefit among subpopulations.

TI  - Documenting life-support preferences in hospitalized patients.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to determine the extent to which patients at high risk of hospital death who undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have previously had their life support preferences addressed and documented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients older than 18 years of age hospitalized for more than 24 hours who sustained a cardiac arrest with attempted CPR at our tertiary care university teaching hospital during 1994 (n = 71). We searched all hospital charts specifying ICD-9 codes: Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, electromechanical dissociation, defibrillation, or CPR. Patients were selected if (1) they had a true cardiac arrest (abrupt cessation of spontaneous circulation) and (2) had attempted CPR or defibrillation. Patients were classified as "high risk" if they satisfied at least one of the following: modified prearrest morbidity index > or = 7, moderate/severe dementia, day 1 APACHE II score > 24 or > or = 4 dysfunctional organ systems. RESULTS: We searched 147 charts; of 71 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 53 were high risk. Of patients at high risk of sustaining a cardiopulmonary arrest during the index hospital admission, 3 (6%) had preferences addressed within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, 7 (13%) had delayed discussion of preferences before arrest, 23 (43%) had preferences addressed post arrest, and 20 (38%) had no documented discussions. Of the 23 high-risk patients initially surviving cardiac arrest, all were subsequently given "do not resuscitate" orders. Univariate analysis of factors associated with life-support discussion before cardiac arrest were previous cardiac arrest (OR, 5.9) and APACHE II score > 24 (OR, 1.1), although neither reached statistical significance. None of the 32 patients with a modified PAM index > or = 7 (32 of 71) survived hospitalization. Only 3 patients survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Early communication regarding life-support preferences is important in high-risk patients so that inappropriate or unwanted treatment is not implemented. Given that optimal care includes addressing and documenting life-support preferences in high-risk patients early in their hospitalization, this standard was infrequently met.

In microperfused rabbit CCD, sodium reabsorption was measured by lumen-to-bath 22Na flux, and bicarbonate transport was assayed by microcalorimetry. Flux measurements were made before and after metabolic substrate changes or application of metabolic inhibitors. Both sodium reabsorption and bicarbonate secretion were dependent on oxidative metabolism (inhibited by antimycin A) and appeared to have no special dependence on glycolysis or the hexose-monophosphate shunt pathways. Endogenous substrates (in the absence of exogenous metabolic substrates) supported a small component of sodium transport; in contrast, bicarbonate reabsorption in the outer medullary collecting duct, which was studied for comparison, was fully supported by endogenous substrates. In the CCD, sodium reabsorption was supported best by a mixture of basolateral metabolic substrates (glucose and acetate, as a fatty acid), whereas bicarbonate secretion was fully supported by either glucose or acetate. Alanine, as a representative amino acid, was not an effective metabolic substrate. Another contrasting feature of the two transport processes was that bicarbonate secretion, and not sodium transport, was supported to some extent by luminal glucose. In sum, principal cells and intercalated cells differ not only in their morphology and function, but also in their metabolism.

TI  - The use of implant-supported ceramometal titanium prostheses following sinus lift and augmentation procedures: a clinical report.  
AB  - This clinical report presents rationale and clinical procedures involved in the use of ceramometal implant-supported titanium-cast prostheses for the rehabilitation of patients with atrophic maxillae requiring iliac crest grafting procedures. Favorable clinical results have been obtained, although clinical observation periods have been limited. The present observations suggest that osseointegrated ceramometal titanium prostheses could form a valuable part of restorative therapy following augmentation procedures. Furthermore, these titanium prostheses may be a meaningful contribution to implant prosthodontics, facilitating restorations of optimum biocompatibility.

TI  - Changes in protein composition of meiotic nodules during mammalian meiosis.  
AB  - Homologous chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination are facilitated by several meiosis-specific structures: the synaptonemal complex (SC), and two types of meiotic nodules: (1) early meiotic nodules (MNs), also called zygotene nodules or early recombination nodules, and (2) late recombination nodules (RNs). The former are thought to be nucleoprotein complexes involved in the check for homology preceding, or accompanying synapsis, while the latter have been shown to be involved in reciprocal recombination. We have examined by immunocytochemistry the meiotic localization of a series of proteins at sites along the asynapsed axial elements prior to homologous synapsis and at sites along the SCs following synapsis. Several of the proteins examined have been implicated in repair/recombination and include RAD51, a mammalian homolog of the Escherichia coli RecA protein; Replication Protein-A (RPA), a single-strand DNA binding protein; and MLH1, a mismatch repair protein which is a homolog of the E. coli MutL protein. In addition two proteins were examined that have been implicated in meiotic checkpoints: ATM, the protein mutated in the human disease Ataxia Telangiectasia, and ATR, another member of the same family of PIK kinases. We present evidence that these proteins are all components of meiotic nodules and document changes in protein composition of these structures during zygonema and pachynema of meiotic prophase in mouse spermatocytes. These studies support the supposition that a subset of MNs are converted into RNs. However, our data also demonstrate changes in protein composition within the context of early MNs, suggesting a differentiation of these nodules during the process of synapsis. The same changes in protein composition occurred on both the normal X axis, which has no homologous pairing partner in spermatocytes, and on the axes of aberrant chromosomes that nonhomologously synapse during synaptic adjustment. These findings suggest that DNA sequences associated with MNs still must undergo an obligatory processing, even in the absence of interactions between homologous chromosomes.

TI  - Rates of treatment of schizophrenia by general practitioners. A pilot study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how many people with schizophrenia are being treated by general practitioners (GPs) and what the associations are between GP characteristics and the number of patients with schizophrenia in their practice. DESIGN AND SETTING: Pilot study by postal survey of all GPs in the Hunter/Taree region. PARTICIPANTS: 349 of 495 GPs (70.5%) replied to the survey--245 urban GPs and 104 rural GPs from the Hunter/Taree region of New South Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GP estimates of the number of patients with schizophrenia currently being treated and by whom. RESULTS: Three-quarters of the GPs in the region were treating patients with schizophrenia, proportionately more in rural areas (87.5%) than in urban areas (70.2%). The typical GP was treating three patients with schizophrenia, two conjointly with specialist services and one without specialist support. It was estimated that the GP-treated prevalence for schizophrenia is 35.5 per 10,000 adults. CONCLUSION: Although individual GPs treat a small number of patients with schizophrenia, collectively they treat most of the patients with this disorder. Because schizophrenia has such a high burden of illness for the patient and the community, we need to find suitable mechanisms for evaluating and enhancing the treatment of schizophrenia in general practice.

TI  - Behavioral and neurobiological consequences of social subjugation during puberty in golden hamsters.  
AB  - In golden hamsters, offensive aggression is facilitated by vasopressin and inhibited by serotonin. We tested whether these neurotransmitter systems respond to modifications resulting from the stress of threat and attack (i.e., social subjugation) during puberty. Male golden hamsters were weaned at postnatal day 25 (P25), exposed daily to aggressive adults from P28 to P42, and tested for offensive aggression as young adults (P45). The results showed a context-dependent alteration in aggressive behavior. Subjugated animals were more likely to attack younger and weaker intruders than nonsubjugated controls. Conversely, subjugated animals were less likely to attack animals of similar size and age. After testing, the animals were killed, and their brains were collected to determine whether these behavioral changes are underlined by changes in the vasopressin and serotonin systems. Social subjugation resulted in a 50% decrease in vasopressin levels within the anterior hypothalamus, a site involved in the regulation of aggression. Furthermore, whereas the density of vasopressin-immunoreactive fibers within the area was not significantly altered in subjugated animals, the number of serotonin-immunoreactive varicosities within the anterior hypothalamus and lateral septum was 20% higher in subjugated animals than in their controls. These results establish puberty as a developmental period sensitive to environmental stressors. Furthermore, the results show that changes in the vasopressin and serotonin systems can correlate with behavioral alterations, supporting the role of these two neurotransmitters in the regulation of aggression.

TI  - Unemployment and serious suicide attempts.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study used a case-control design to examine the association between unemployment and risk of medically serious suicide attempt. METHOD: A sample of 302 individuals who made serious suicide attempts was contrasted with 1028 randomly selected community control subjects. RESULTS: Individuals who made serious suicide attempts reported higher rates of current unemployment (OR = 4.2) than control subjects. This association was similar for males and females. However, even before adjustment for confounding factors it was evident that exposure to unemployment made only a small contribution to suicide attempt risk. The population attributable risk for exposure to unemployment was 7.3%. After adjustment for antecedent childhood, family and educational factors the association between unemployment and risk of serious suicide attempt was reduced but remained significant (OR = 2.1), suggesting that common antecedent factors made a large contribution to risks of both unemployment and serious suicide attempt. When both antecedent family and childhood factors, and psychiatric morbidity were taken into account, unemployment was not significantly related to risks of serious suicide attempt. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide support for the contention that much of the association between unemployment and suicidal behaviour is non-causal, and reflects common or correlated factors that contribute to risks of both unemployment and suicidal behaviour. Any remaining association between unemployment and suicide attempt risk appears to arise from the correlation that exists between unemployment and psychiatric disorder.

TI  - Multicyclic dose-intensive chemotherapy with circulating progenitor cell support for high-risk primary breast cancer.  
AB  - The feasibility and safety of the administration of multiple cycles of dose-intensive chemotherapy (CT) supported with repeated reinfusions of circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) were evaluated in a prospective study of adjuvant initial therapy of poor-prognosis breast cancer. Eighteen patients with resectable breast cancer involving >/= 10 axillary nodes or >/= 5 axillary nodes and negativity of the estrogen receptor status received a cycle of standard FEC regimen (5-FU 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, CTX 600 mg/m2, i.v. on day 1) followed by G-CSF as CPC mobilization technique. Collected CPCs were fractionated and reinfused, with G-CSF, after each of the 4 subsequent cycles of high-dose FEC (HD-FEC) (5-FU 750 mg/m2, epirubicin 120 mg/m2, CTX 3 g/m2, i.v.) planned at 21 day intervals. The median numbers of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM collected (with one or two leukaphereses per patient) were 9.7x10(6)/kg (range: 2.5-22.9) and 9.9x10(4)/kg (range: 1.9-27.3), respectively, and day 9 was the median first day of procedure (range: 8-12) after FEC. All patients received the 4 courses of HD-FEC (for a total of 72 cycles). Hemopoietic recovery was rapid after each cycle and there was no treatment-related delays in CT administration. Mucositis was the major non-hematological toxicity. There were 2, 3, 7 and 9 episodes of WHO grade 3/4 mucositis in cycles 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. These severe episodes lasted a median of 4 days (range: 2-6) but no patient required parenteral nutrition. The mean +/- SD total hospital stay lasted 10 +/- 2 days. The delivery of 4 cycles of dose-intensive FEC CT supported by CPCs (mobilized with a single course of standard-dose FEC + G-CSF) is feasible and safe. It could represent an effective alternative strategy to other more aggressive programs for the adjuvant therapy of high-risk early breast cancer.

TI  - Expression of IL-4, Cepsilon RNA, and Iepsilon RNA in the nasal mucosa of patients with seasonal rhinitis: effect of topical corticosteroids.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal allergen provocation has demonstrated that allergen-induced rhinitis is associated with an increase in local IL-4 mRNA and IgE heavy chain (Cepsilon) and IgE heavy chain promoter (Iepsilon) RNA and that pretreatment with topical glucocorticosteroids inhibits the increase in these transcripts. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether observations made after acute allergen provocation can be extended to the case of chronic exposure experienced during the pollen season. METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from the inferior turbinate of 33 pollen-sensitive subjects with allergic rhinitis before and during pollen season. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion and treated with either topical steroids (200 microg fluticasone propionate twice daily; n = 16) or matched placebo nasal spray (n = 17) before the pollen season. Alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase immunocytochemistry was used to identify B cells (CD20+), and in situ hybridization was used to detect IL-4, Cepsilon, and Iepsilon RNA+ cells. RESULTS: Baseline examination revealed IL-4 and Cepsilon RNA but virtually no Iepsilon RNA+ cells in the nasal mucosa. Analysis revealed a significant difference in the expression of Cepsilon and Iepsilon RNA+ cells (p < 0.001). Biopsy specimens taken after antigen exposure exhibited highly significant increases in placebo-treated (p < 0.001) but not steroid-treated patients. In both groups, the number of CD20+ cells was unchanged when preexposure and postexposure biopsy specimens were compared. CONCLUSIONS: These results show strong support for the hypothesis that IgE class switching occurs locally within the nasal mucosa of subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and that this response can be inhibited through strategies directed against local IgE production.

TI  - Interaction of phospholipid vesicles with smooth metal-oxide surfaces.  
AB  - The interaction of phospholipid vesicles with planar metal oxide supports has been previously reported as a means of preparing supported lipid bilayers, which are useful models of biological membranes. Nevertheless, extant evidence that bilayers are actually formed is rather circumstantial, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for their formation have never been delineated. Here, we tackle this problem by using smooth planar optical waveguides as the support. Analysis of the lightmode spectra of the waveguides, measured in situ during the deposition process, yields the mass of lipid deposited at the solid/liquid interface. By comparing the optogeometric parameters of the structures assembled from the vesicles with those of a lipid bilayer of known structure assembled using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, we show that in many cases the vesicles remain intact and form a supported layer of vesicles rather than a bilayer, and often mixed structures (intact vesicles embedded in a bilayer partially covering the surface) occur. Careful analysis of the lipid deposition kinetics corroborates this result. We have also found that divalent cations dramatically promote attachment of mixed phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol vesicles to form supported vesicle layers, and bilayer formation from pure phosphatidylcholine vesicles.

TI  - Characterization and possible functions of a new filamentous bacteriophage from Vibrio cholerae O139.  
AB  - The emergence and rapid rise to dominance of Vibrio cholerae O139 in India and Bangladesh in 1992 led to the consideration that choleraphage might serve as both a selective mechanism and a means for horizontal transmission of genetic information. A filamentous phage '493' from O139 strain AJ27-493 has been purified and partially characterized. The phage was inactive on classical biotype V. cholerae O1 but it was active on El Tor biotype strains isolated prior to 1994 when El Tor re-emerged in Bangladesh. More recent El Tor isolates were all resistant to the phage. The phage was also active on O139 strains. Unlike the filamentous ctx phi, the receptor for 493 is not TcpA. The phage genome was a 9.3 kb closed circular single-stranded molecule containing a 0.4 kb double-stranded stem supporting a 2 kb single-stranded loop. A 283 bp fragment was cloned and used as a probe in Southern hybridization, in parallel with total phage 493 DNA. These probes hybridized both chromosomally and extrachromosomally with most O139 strains, but not with O1 strains. Infection of hybridization-negative El Tor or O139 strains resulted in the presence of hybridizing loci (both plasmid and chromosomal), in the appearance of an 18 kDa protein, and in marked alterations in colonial morphology. Phage 493 is clearly distinct from other O139 choleraphages which have been described. Phage 493 DNA hybridized with an encapsulated non-O1 (O31) strain (NRT36S) which was isolated before O139 was recognized. NRT36S also produces a phage which can infect El Tor strains with low efficiency. Further studies may reveal whether bacteriophage play a role in the emergence and the territoriality of new choleragenic vibrios.

AHCs are struggling to adapt to new reimbursement mechanisms and to compete effectively for limited dollars, but are constrained by administrative and governance structures that are slow to evolve. Their multiple missions, including education, research, and care for complex patients and underserved populations, are at risk. Although most recognize the need for substantive reorganization, available resources and market specifics vary dramatically from one AHC to another. The current approaches to adaptation by four AHCs are described, along with some of the unique challenges confronted by academic pediatric programs.

TI  - Supporting cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium decreases postnatally.  
AB  - It is well known that progenitor cells in the basal layer of olfactory epithelium proliferate continuously throughout life; the offspring of these dividing cells produce replacements for receptor neurons. In the rat the number of proliferating basal cells/mm length of epithelium (proliferation density) decreases with postnatal age while the area of the olfactory sheet increases. The supporting cells, which act as the glia of the olfactory epithelium, also divide. We examined in detail some aspects of the dynamics of olfactory supporting cell proliferation to determine whether their rate of proliferation changes with age, and how it compares with the rate in basal progenitor cells. Using BrdU to label dividing cells, we determined the proliferation density of supporting cells and basal cells in 10 microm coronal sections from six different anterior-posterior regions in rats ranging in age from birth (P1) until P333. We observed a dramatic decrease in supporting cell proliferation density from P1 (80 cells/mm) to P11 (32 cells/mm) to P21 (12 cells/mm); the density decreases continuously to P333 (0.4 cells/mm). This reduction was even more dramatic than that in the basal cell population (Weiler and Farbman, 1997). Analysis of the data for correlation between basal and supporting cell proliferation revealed a weak correlation in neonates but no correlation in older animals. This suggests that the mechanisms that regulate proliferation of the two cell types are different. Our data also indicate that the proliferation of supporting cells is related only to growth in surface area of the epithelium. No turnover seems to occur in the supporting cells as it does in the olfactory neurons, where proliferation of basal cells is necessary for both growth and replacement.

TI  - Differential effects of the rejection of bone marrow allografts by the depletion of activating versus inhibiting Ly-49 natural killer cell subsets.  
AB  - Natural killer cells mediate the specific rejection of bone marrow cell (BMC) allografts in lethally irradiated mice. The Ly-49 family of molecules present on subsets of murine NK cells appears capable of binding class I MHC molecules, resulting in transmission of an inhibitory signal to the NK cell. These Ly-49 family members have been shown to have an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif that is responsible for the inhibitory signal. However, a new Ly-49 family member was found that lacks this motif, Ly-49D, and evidence suggests that this may be an activating receptor. We therefore compared the role of the activating Ly-49 member with NK cells bearing inhibitory Ly-49 receptors in BMC rejection. Depletion of Ly-49D+ NK cells in H-2b mice abrogated their ability to reject H-2d BMC allografts. Similarly, Ly-49C+ NK cells also were shown to mediate the specific rejection of H-2d BMC. When both subsets were depleted, an additive enhancement of BMC engraftment was observed, indicating that both subsets play a role in the rejection of allogeneic H-2-homozygous H-2d BMC. However, rejection of H-2(b x d) or D8 (H-2b, Dd transgene) BMC allografts was unaffected by Ly-49C+ NK cell depletion in H-2b mice. In marked contrast, depletion of Ly-49D+ NK cells in H-2b mice totally abrogated the rejection of H-2(b x d) heterozygous BMC in support of in vitro data suggesting that Ly-49D+ NK cells receive activating signals. Therefore, NK subsets demonstrate a differential ability to reject H-2 homozygous and heterozygous BMC.

TI  - Vibrational spectrum of the lumi intermediate in the room temperature rhodopsin photo-reaction.  
AB  - The vibrational spectrum (650-1750 cm(-1)) of the lumi-rhodopsin (lumi) intermediate formed in the microsecond time regime of the room-temperature rhodopsin (RhRT) photoreaction is measured for the first time using picosecond time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (PTR/CARS). The vibrational spectrum of lumi is recorded 2.5 micros after the 3-ps, 500-nm excitation of RhRT. Complementary to Fourier transform infrared spectra recorded at Rh sample temperatures low enough to freeze lumi, these PTR/CARS results provide the first detailed view of the vibrational degrees of freedom of room-temperature lumi (lumiRT) through the identification of 21 bands. The exceptionally low intensity (compared to those observed in bathoRT) of the hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) bands, the moderate intensity and absolute positions of C-C stretching bands, and the presence of high-intensity C==C stretching bands suggest that lumiRT contains an almost planar (nontwisting), all-trans retinal geometry. Independently, the 944-cm(-1) position of the most intense HOOP band implies that a resonance coupling exists between the out-of-plane retinal vibrations and at least one group among the amino acids comprising the retinal binding pocket. The formation of lumiRT, monitored via PTR/CARS spectra recorded on the nanosecond time scale, can be associated with the decay of the blue-shifted intermediate (BSI(RT)) formed in equilibrium with the bathoRT intermediate. PTR/CARS spectra measured at a 210-ns delay contain distinct vibrational features attributable to BSI(RT), which suggest that the all-trans retinal in both BSI(RT) and lumiRT is strongly coupled to part of the retinal binding pocket. With regard to the energy storage/transduction mechanism in RhRT, these results support the hypothesis that during the formation of lumiRT, the majority of the photon energy absorbed by RhRT transfers to the apoprotein opsin.

TI  - Surviving social assistance: 12-month prevalence of depression in sole-support parents receiving social assistance.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is generally recognized that poverty and depression can coexist among single parents receiving social assistance, there is insufficient research on this topic. The goals of this study therefore were to investigate the prevalence, correlates and health care expenditures associated with depression among sole-support parents receiving social assistance. METHODS: Sole-support parents who had applied for social assistance in 2 regions of southwestern Ontario were included in the study. Depression was diagnosed with the 1994 University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview short forms. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence rate of depressive disorder among the parents interviewed was 45.4% (345/760). A total of 247 (32.5%) had major depressive disorder alone, 19 (2.5%) had dysthymia, and 79 (10.4%) had both major depressive disorder and dysthymia ("double depression"). Those with major depressive disorder, particularly double depression, had significantly higher rates of coexisting psychiatric disorder than those without depressive disorders. Parents with depression reported higher rates of developmental delay and behaviour problems in their children than parents without depression. Expenditures for health care services were higher for parents with depression and for their children than for parents without depressive disorder and their children. INTERPRETATION: Single parents receiving social assistance have high rates of depression. Such parents with depression also have higher rates of other psychiatric disorders and higher expenditures for health care services, and their children have higher rates of developmental delay and behaviour problems.

TI  - Interventional cardiology in Europe 1994. Working Group Coronary Circulation of the European Society of Cardiology [see comments]  
AB  - The working group Coronary Circulation of the European Society of Cardiology conducts an annual survey of cardiac interventions in Europe with the support of the national societies of cardiology. A detailed questionnaire about cardiac interventions performed during 1994 was mailed to all members of the European Society of Cardiology. Incomplete or absent data from eight national members precluded their inclusion in the final analysis. Thus, this report summarizes the cardiac interventions performed during 1994 in 29 of 37 members of the European Society of Cardiology, representing a total population of approximately 490 million inhabitants. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY: A total of 922,687 coronary angiograms were reported during 1994, representing an increase of 22% compared with 1993 and of 35% compared with 1992. The mean incidence of coronary angiograms was 1881/10(6) inhabitants, ranging from 4417/10(6) inhabitants in Germany to 35/10(6) inhabitants in Romania, Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy with 50% of the European population performed 73% of all cardiac interventions. CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY: During 1994, a total of 224,722 coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures were reported in Europe, an increase of 22% compared with 1993 and of 52% compared with 1992. Adjusted per capita, the mean incidence of coronary angioplasty was 458/10(6) inhabitants, ranging from 1091/10(6) inhabitants in Germany to 6/10(6) inhabitants in Romania. On average, the ratio PTCA per coronary angiogram was 0.24, ranging from 0.37 in the Netherlands to 0.06 in Cyprus. Ad hoc PTCA accounted for 22% of all PTCA cases. The majority (81%) of PTCAs were restricted to a single vessel. Major complications were reported in 2% of patients undergoing PTCA, including death (0.3%), myocardial infarction (1.0%) and need for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (0.7%). CORONARY STENTING: Coronary stents were utilized in 21,599 coronary interventions during 1994, an increase of 235% compared with 1993 and thus representing the fastest growth in interventional cardiology. The number of European countries employing stents during coronary angioplasty grew from 14 during 1993 to 24 during 1994. Elective use (38%) became the most frequent indication for coronary stenting during 1994, replacing bail-out stenting as the primary indication during 1993. OTHER NEW DEVICES: Other new interventional therapeutic devices were employed in 8827 cases. Only the Rotablator was used more frequently during 1994 as compared with 1993. All other new therapeutic devices showed a decline. Coronary ultrasound was utilized in 3032 interventions and coronary angioscopy in 304 cases during 1994. NON-CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: Valvuloplasty remained the most frequent non-coronary intervention in Europe during 1994 with a total of 2622 mitral. 609 pulmonary and 506 aortic valvuloplasties. CATHETERIZATION FACILITIES: The number of facilities per 10(6) inhabitants performing invasive cardiac procedures in Europe during 1994 ranged from 7.7 in Iceland to 0.2 in Romania (European mean 2.9). The number of trained operators per 10(6) inhabitants ranged from 24 in Germany to 0.4 in Romania (European mean 10). During 1994, a mean of 701 coronary angiograms and 170 PTCAs were performed per catheterization facility in Europe (range: 1052 coronary angiograms and 293 PTCAs per facility in Norway to 218 coronary angiograms and 37 PTCAs per facility in Romania). CONCLUSIONS: The number of both coronary angiograms and coronary angioplasties continues to grow at an annual rate of approximately 20% in Europe. There is a wide range in the amount of revascularization procedures performed between western and eastern European countries. However, countries with the lowest numbers of coronary angiograms and coronary angioplasties, e.g. Romania, also show the fastest annual growth. About one quarter of

TI  - Nursing education and international health in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify international health activities in United States, Latin American, and Caribbean schools of nursing. In the international community, nurses face challenges similar to those in related professions, but without the benefit of a long tradition. There is little research about how nursing education and associated activities prepare nurses to deal with international health, and little information about the extent of international health activities in U.S. schools of nursing. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: Using a questionnaire with 16 items, a survey was conducted in 1995 on a random sample of representatives from 100 university schools of nursing in the United States plus 15 schools with known international activities (10 from the United States and 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean). FINDINGS: International health as a program topic was found in one-third of U.S. schools of nursing. However, nursing curriculums do not integrate international health with other subjects. Also, partnerships with foreign institutions are incipient and international health activities are usually individual initiatives with little institutional support. CONCLUSIONS: For nurses to become major contributors to international health, nursing curriculum content must shift from "international nursing" to "international health." Programs of nursing education should include study of social, economic, and political factors that affect health care systems. Schools should develop partnership agreements.

TI  - Yeast RNA polymerase II transcription in vitro is inhibited in the presence of nucleotide excision repair: complementation of inhibition by Holo-TFIIH and requirement for RAD26.  
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is essential both for transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and for nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA. We have established cell extracts which support RNAP II transcription from the yeast CYC1 promoter or NER of transcriptionally silent damaged DNA on independent plasmid templates and substrates. When plasmid templates and substrates for both processes are simultaneously incubated with these extracts, transcription is significantly inhibited. This inhibition is strictly dependent on active NER and can be complemented with purified holo-TFIIH. These results suggest that in the presence of active NER, TFIIH is preferentially mobilized from the basal transcription machinery for use in NER. Inhibition of transcription in the presence of active NER requires the RAD26 gene, the yeast homolog of the human Cockayne syndrome group B gene (CSB).

TI  - Expression of Fas-Fas ligand system associated with atresia in murine ovary.  
AB  - We detected that Fas receptor (Fas) was expressed at transcriptional levels in oocytes/eggs and some granulosa cells of murine ovary, whereas, Fas ligand (FasL) was found to be strongly expressed in granulosa cells by means of in situ hybridisation. These results were supported by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb)/FasL Ab. The lysates from granulosa cells were precipitated by anti-FasL Ab, exhibiting a specific band at 40 kDa. When zona pellucida (ZP)-free eggs were incubated with granulosa cells in vitro, apoptosis (DNA fragmentation) was induced in the eggs, as detected by the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase mediated dUTP-nick end labelling (TUNEL) method. To examine whether FasL-bearing cells can induce apoptosis in eggs expressing Fas through molecular interaction between FasL and Fas, we employed a baculovirus expression system to generate FasL on the surface of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The co-incubation of eggs with Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) and FasL transfected Sf9 (Sf9-FasL) cells in vitro was performed and resulted in the induction of apoptosis in eggs as detected by the TUNEL method. Apoptosis was absent in eggs co-incubated with AcNPV-1393 transfected Sf9 (Sf9-1393) cells. Thus, ovarian atresia was suggested to be induced by molecular interaction between FasL on granulosa cells and Fas on oocytes/eggs during oogenesis.

TI  - The use of a standardized positioning support cushion during daily routine of breast irradiation.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The use of positioning and immobilization techniques during external beam irradiation of the female breast is time consuming and expensive. The currently available standardized positioning devices are insufficient. For this reason, we designed a new and generally useable hard foam positioning support cushion for the use during breast irradiation, and tested its clinical usefulness in a prospective study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-five female breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conservative surgery were irradiated either without immobilization (n = 27) or with the positioning support cushion (n = 28). The time necessary for patient setup, the lying subjective comfort and--comparing portal images with simulator images--the reproducibility of the set up were determined. RESULTS: Irradiation reproducibility was significantly improved (average deviation without positioning support cushion: 8.4 mm, with positioning support cushion: 6.1 mm, p < 0.001). The time required for the positioning of the patient with positioning support cushion was in average 73 s, without cushion it was 55 s. A significantly higher proportion of patients (72%) found the position with the positioning support cushion as pleasant, whereas only 46% of patients were pleased with the position without cushion. CONCLUSION: The positioning support cushion designed in our department makes a substantial contribution to quality assurance in breast irradiation. It significantly increases the patients' comfort in a supine position. In contrast to conventional positioning and fixation aids it may be quickly and easily applied at low costs. Therefore, its use can be recommended.

TI  - Extraction, assay, and analysis of antimicrobials from plants with activity against dental pathogens (Streptococcus sp.) [see comments]  
AB  - Many dental and periodontal diseases are largely a question of bacterial etiology. Dental caries develop due to an increase of strongly acidogenic and aciduric gram-positive bacteria while common forms of periodontal disease are linked to anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in subgingival plaque. Many plants and plant-derived antimicrobial components are used in folklore therapeutics for the treatment of periodontal disorders and for the purposes of oral hygiene. Some have been evaluated for possible use in modern medicine, while thousands of other potentially useful/plants have not been tested. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of screening for antibacterials isolated from plants with activity against three representatives of oral streptococci. We developed and tested the following methodologies: (1) Extraction of antibacterial components from plants; (2) Assays for antibacterial activity; (3) Chromatographic methods for initial analysis of compounds of interest. The screening process for plant antimicrobials consisted of extraction of plant material and assay of antibacterial activity using a spotting test with the selected oral streptococci as indicator strains. In addition, we developed chromatographic procedures that allow characterization and optimization of initial isolation steps. Depending on the indicator microorganisms used, the screening assay can target additional pathogens including other streptococci (group A and B, and pneumococci) and periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas. Also, we noted that the activity of some extracts varied against different oral bacteria. Our conclusion, supported by extensive data, was that the screening for antimicrobials from plants is a feasible approach to the identification of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties against dental pathogens.

TI  - Carbon disulfide and N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate generate thiourea cross-links on erythrocyte spectrin in vivo.  
AB  - CS2, a known neurotoxicant, is used in the viscose production of rayon and is also a decomposition product of N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate, a metabolic product of the drug disulfiram used in alcohol aversion therapy. Previous in vitro investigations have demonstrated the ability of CS2 to cross-link proteins through thiourea, dithiocarbamate ester, and disulfide structures. Although in vivo studies have supported protein cross-linking as both a mechanism of neurotoxicity and a potential biomarker of effect, the chemical structures responsible for CS2-mediated protein cross-linking in vivo have not been elucidated. In the present study, the structure of one type of stable protein cross-link produced on erythrocyte spectrin by CS2 in vivo is determined. Rats were exposed to 50, 500, and 800 ppm CS2 for 13 weeks by inhalation or to 3 mmol/kg N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate administered orally on alternating days for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte spectrin preparations from control and exposed rats were hydrolyzed using 6 N HCl and separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The fraction that coeluted with the synthetic deuterated lysine-lysine thiourea internal standard was derivatized with 3-[4'-[(N,N,N-trimethylamino)ethylene]phenyl] 2-isothiocyanate and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using selected reaction monitoring detection. Lysine-lysine thiourea was detected in spectrin preparations obtained from CS2-treated rats at 500 and 800 ppm and N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate-treated rats, but not from controls. These results establish that CS2-mediated protein cross-linking occurs in vivo through the generation of Lys-Lys thiourea and that diethyldithiocarbamate can, through in vivo release of CS2, produce the same cross-linking structure. This observation supports the utility of cross-linking of peripheral proteins as a specific dosimeter of internal exposure for CS2 and provides a mechanistic explanation to account for the high-molecular-weight neurofilament protein species isolated from rats exposed to CS2 or N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate.

TI  - Simple collagen-like peptides support platelet adhesion under static but not under flow conditions: interaction via alpha2 beta1 and von Willebrand factor with specific sequences in native collagen is a requirement to resist shear forces.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to define the need for specific collagen sequences and the role of their conformation in platelet adhesion to collagen under both static and flow conditions. We recently reported that simple triple-helical collagen-related peptides (CRPs), GCP*(GPP*)10GCP*G and GKP*(GPP*)10GKP*G (single-letter amino acid code, P* = hydroxyproline; Morton et al, Biochem J 306:337, 1995) were potent stimulators of platelet activation and were able to support the adhesion of gel-filtered platelets examined under static conditions. The present study investigated whether these same peptides were able to support platelet adhesion under more physiologic conditions by examining static adhesion with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and adhesion under flow conditions. In the static adhesion assay, we observed 20% surface coverage with platelet aggregates. In marked contrast, there was a total lack of adhesion under flow conditions examined at shear rates of 50 and 300 s-1. Thus, the interaction of platelets with the CRPs is a low-affinity interaction unable on its own to withstand shear forces. However, the addition of CRPs to whole blood, in the presence of 200 micromol/L D-arginyl-glycyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophan (dRGDW) to prevent platelet aggregation, caused an inhibition of about 50% of platelet adhesion to collagens I and III under flow. These results suggest that the collagen triple helix per se, as defined by these simple collagen sequences, plays an important contributory role in the overall process of adhesion to collagen under flow. The monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 176D7, directed against the alpha2 subunit of the integrin alpha2 beta1, was found to inhibit static platelet adhesion to monomeric but not fibrillar collagens I and III. However, under flow conditions, anti-alpha2 MoAbs (176D7 anf 6F1) inhibited adhesion to both monomeric and fibrillar collagens, indicating that alpha2 beta1 is essential for adhesion to collagen under flow, independent of collagen conformation, whether monomeric or polymeric. To obtain further insight into the nature of the different adhesive properties of CRPs and native collagen, we investigated the relative importance of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and the integrin alpha2 beta1 in platelet adhesion to collagen types I and III, using the same shear rate (300 s-1) as used when testing CRPs under flow conditions. Our results, together with recent data of others, support a two-step mechanism of platelet interaction with collagen under flow conditions. The first step involves adhesion via both the indirect interaction of platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib with collagen mediated by vWF binding to specific vWF-recognition sites in collagen and the direct interaction between platelet alpha2 beta1 and specific alpha2 beta1-recognition sites in collagen. This suffices to hold platelets at the collagen surface. The second step occurs via another collagen receptor (thought to be GPVI) that binds to simple collagen sequences, required essentially to delineate the collagen triple helix. Recognition of the triple helix leads to strengthening of attachment and platelet activation.

TI  - Crystal structures of two mutants that have implications for the folding of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A.  
AB  - The Tyr92-Pro93 peptide group of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) exists in the cis conformation in the native state. From unfolding/refolding kinetic studies of the disulfide-intact wild-type protein and of a variant in which Pro93 had been replaced by Ala, it had been suggested that the Tyr92-Ala93 peptide group also exists in the cis conformation in the native state. Here, we report the crystal structure of the P93A variant. Although there is disorder in the region of residues 92 and 93, the best structural model contains a cis peptide at this position, lending support to the results of the kinetics experiments. We also report the crystal structure of the C[40, 95]A variant, which is an analog of the major rate-determining three-disulfide intermediate in the oxidative folding of RNase A, missing the 40-95 disulfide bond. As had been detected by NMR spectroscopy, the crystal structure of this analog shows disorder in the region surrounding the missing disulfide. However, the global chain fold of the remainder of the protein, including the disulfide bond between Cys65 and Cys72, appears to be unaffected by the mutation.

TI  - Barium triggers rapid endocytosis in calf adrenal chromaffin cells.  
AB  - 1. Changes in cell capacitance were monitored in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from calf adrenal chromaffin cells using a software-based phase-tracking technique. Rapid endocytosis and exocytosis were observed in extracellular solutions containing either Ca2+ or Ba2+. 2. There was no significant difference in the magnitude or the time course of rapid endocytosis of cells stimulated in Ca2+ as compared to Ba2+. When cells were pretreated with caffeine and thapsigargin in order to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores, rapid endocytosis in Ba2+ was not affected. This indicates that Ba2+ itself is capable of supporting rapid endocytosis. 3. The application of the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium via the intracellular pipette solution did not inhibit rapid endocytosis. Although our findings are inconsistent with an immediate requirement for calmodulin in rapid endocytosis, they do not rule out an involvement on a longer time scale. 4. While rapid endocytosis was not affected by the substitution of Ca2+ with Ba2+, the maximum rate of exocytosis was higher in cells stimulated in Ca2+ than in Ba2+. Since Ba2+ currents were much larger than Ca2+ currents during depolarizations to +10 mV (the test potential used in these experiments), Ba2+ appears to be less efficient at promoting exocytosis than Ca2+.

TI  - Strategies for providing care and support to children orphaned by AIDS.  
AB  - As a result of the severe HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan countries such as Zimbabwe, where between 25-30% of the adult population are estimated to be infected, there are a growing number of orphans requiring care and support. Traditionally, orphans have been absorbed within the extended family but this is becoming more difficult because of the large number of young adults dying. The burden of care and support is falling on the very young and the very old. A number of strategies have been introduced to provide this care and support. Institutions, though popular, are very expensive to run, have limited capacity and only really cater for physical needs. Interventions which simply react to those who present to them may not reach the most needy and may encourage dependency. Community-based orphan care has been identified as the best and most cost-effective way of caring for orphans. An example of a community-based orphan visiting programme is presented. In the last six months of 1996, the FOCUS programme's 88 volunteers made a total of 9,634 visits to 3,192 orphans in 798 families at an average cost of US+1.55 per visit. The key elements of such programmes have been identified. They need to be implemented by a community-based organization (CBO) within a defined community. Volunteers should be selected from within the community. They need to be trained and supported as they enumerate orphans, identify the most needy and carry out regular visits. The volunteers should keep records of all their activities. These records can then be used as a basis for monitoring the programme. In order to cope with the increasing number of orphans in resource-poor settings like Zimbabwe, it is essential that such programmes be replicated and scaled up. This not only an economic necessity but is also a way of providing appropriate and effective services to those who need them.

TI  - Determination of 60% or greater carotid stenosis: a prospective comparison of magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasound with conventional angiography.  
AB  - The morbidity and cost of conventional angiography (CA) have focused recent efforts in cerebrovascular imaging upon the exclusive use of noninvasive techniques. Our purpose was to prospectively evaluate carotid magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and to compare its accuracy with color-flow duplex (CFD). Fifty patients were prospectively evaluated with CA and MRA after clinical and CFD findings indicated the need for carotid angiography. CFD measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were made. MRA results were categorized as 0%-39%, 40%-59%, 60%-79%, or 80%-99% stenosis or occluded. Determination of percent carotid stenosis by CA was made as in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the probability of correctly predicting a > or =60% stenosis using various CFD thresholds and MRA was assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in determining > or =60% stenosis were estimated. For MRA the sensitivity was 85% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 69%-94%), specificity 70% (CI = 56%-81 %), PPV 68% (CI = 53%-80%), and NPV 86% (CI = 72%-94%). For CFD the sensitivity was 89% (CI = 74%-96%), specificity 93% (CI = 82%-98%), PPV 89% (CI = 74%-96%), and NPV 93% (CI = 82%-98%). When MRA and CFD results were concordant (n = 64), the sensitivity was 100% (CI = 89%-100%), specificity 95% (CI = 81%-99%), PPV 94% (CI = 77%-99%), and the NPV was 100% (CI = 92%-100%). The area under the ROC curve for CFD was 95%, compared to 83% for MRA (p = 0.0005). We conclude that the low specificity of MRA precludes its use as the definitive imaging modality for carotid stenosis. The 93% specificity of CFD alone warrants its consideration as a definitive carotid imaging study. By ROC curve analysis, CFD offers superior accuracy to MRA. Our data support noninvasive preoperative carotid imaging for detecting a threshold stenosis of > or =60% whether CFD is used alone, or in combination with the selective use of MRA.

AB  - Several techniques are available for the provision of enteral nutritional support. Nasal tubes, gastrostomy tubes and jejunostomy tubes can be distinguised. Nasal tubes are used for short-term support, gastrostomy tubes (preferably via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) for long-term support (over 4 to 6 weeks), while (needle catheter) jejunostomy tubes are most often used to provide early enteral nutrition immediately after operations on the proximal gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent complications are: with the nasal tube dislodging, clogging and aspiration, with the gastrostomy tube peristomal infection and with the jejunostomy tube, obstruction. It should further be noted that the quantity of enteral nutrition prescribed and that actually administered may differ substantially so that patients with a feeding device may even become malnourished. With proper patient selection and secure control of the energy balance, feeding tubes are simple (temporary) devices that improve the patient's health and quality of life.

AB  - We investigated whether in vitro L1210 growth inhibition by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; 740 microM) and 4-amidinoindan-1-one 2'-amidinohydrazone (CGP 48664A; 1.7 microM) is reversible with N1-acetylspermine (N1-acSp). Influences of N1-acSp dose (1-100 microM), time (0-12 h at 100 microM), aminoguanidine (AG, 1 mM) and cell numbers (at 1 microM N1-acSp) on percentage S-phase, polyamine contents and viability were determined. DFMO/CGP 48664A decreased percentage S-phase from 58 to 26%, decreased spermidine (Sd) and spermine (Sp) contents 3-fold, but did not affect viability. With increasing N1-acSp dose, S-phase percentage and Sd contents increased concomitantly, reaching plateau values that were comparable with those of untreated controls. S-phase and Sd content increased from 4-6 h after N1-acSp administration, reaching plateau values from 11 and 6 h, respectively. N1-acSp content was dose dependent and increased linearly to reach plateau values from 8 h. AG did not affect any of these parameters. Addition of 1 microM N1-acSp to decreasing numbers of DFMO/CGP 48664A-treated cells caused increasing S-phase percentage, Sd and N1-acSp contents. We conclude that cell cycle kinetics of cultured L1210 cells can be manipulated by the induction of growth inhibition with DFMO/CGP 48664A and its subsequent abolishment with N1-acSp. N1-acSp accumulation rate and its subsequent conversion to Sd is relatively slow compared with intracellular Sd needs. The data support the notion that Sd is the most important polyamine for growth.

TI  - Trypanosomatid protozoa in plants of southeastern Spain: characterization by analysis of isoenzymes, kinetoplast DNA, and metabolic behavior.  
AB  - Three flagellates of the family Trypanosomatidae were isolated from mango fruits (Mangifera indica) and from the stems of clover (Trifolium glomeratum) and Amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) in southeastern Spain and were adapted to in vitro culture in monophase media. The parasites showed an ultrastructural pattern similar to that of other species of the genus Phytomonas. Mango and clover isolates differed from amaranth isolates in ultrastructural terms. The isolates were characterized by isoenzymatic analysis and by kDNA analysis using five different restriction endonucleases. With eight of the nine enzymatic systems, mango and clover isolates were distinguished from those of amaranth. Nevertheless, with the enzymes malate dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, flagellates isolated from clover were differentiated from those isolated from mango. Electrophoretic and restriction-endonuclease analysis of kDNA minicircles showed similar restriction cleavage patterns for the isolates from mango and clover, whereas the patterns of the amaranth isolates differed. The results of the present study confirm that the strains isolated from mango and clover constitute a phylogenetically closely related group of plant trypanosomatids, which is more distantly related to the strain isolated from amaranth. The similarities in the results obtained for isolates from mango and clover foliage, on the one hand, and those obtained from tomato and cherimoya fruits (studied previously), on the other, as well as the geographic proximity of the different plants support the contention that only one strain is involved, albeit one strain that can parasitize different plants. Furthermore, some of the plants appear to act as reservoirs for the parasites. On the other hand, the metabolism studies using [1H]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not reveal that the catabolism of Phytomonas in general follows a pattern common to all the species or isolates. Phytomonas are incapable of completely degrading glucose, excreting a large part of their carbon skeleton into the medium as fermentative metabolites (acetate, ethanol, glycine, glycerol, and succinate).

TI  - Failure of leptin to affect basal and insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism of rat skeletal muscle in vitro.  
AB  - Studies on different isolated tissues have provided evidence that leptin may directly modulate cellular glucose handling. The present study was performed to elucidate leptin's action on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in native muscle tissue, which under physiological circumstances is the quantitatively most important target tissue of insulin. Isolated rat soleus muscle strips were incubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of leptin (0, 1, 10, or 100 nmol/l) under basal or insulin-stimulated conditions (10 nmol/l). No effects of leptin were found on the rates of 3H-2-deoxy-glucose transport (basal: control, 314+/-14; 1 nmol/l leptin, 320+/-17; 10 nmol/l leptin, 314+/-13; 100 nmol/l leptin, 322+/-16; insulin-stimulated: control, 690+/-33; 1 nmol/l leptin, 691+/-29; 10 nmol/l leptin, 665+/-26; 100 nmol/l leptin, 664+/-27; cpm x mg(-1) x h(-1); NS vs respective control) and on net glucose incorporation into glycogen (basal: control, 1.75+/-0.18; 1 nmol/l leptin, 2.01+/-0.13; 10 nmol/l leptin, 1.92+/-0.11; 100 nmol/l leptin, 1.81+/-0.13; insulin-stimulated: control, 5.98+/-0.40; 1 nmol/l leptin, 5.93+/-0.30; 10 nmol/l leptin, 5.46+/-0.25; 100 nmol/l leptin, 5.85+/-0.30; micromol x g(-1) x h(-1); NS vs respective control). In parallel, leptin failed to affect rates of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis as well as muscle glycogen content. Further experiments revealed that the inability of leptin to directly affect muscle glucose handling prevailed independently of muscle fiber type (soleus and epitrochlearis muscle), of ambient insulin concentrations (0-30 nmol/l), and of leptin exposure time (1 h or 6 h). Thus, our findings fail to support speculations about a physiological role of direct insulin-mimetic or insulin-desensitizing effects of leptin on skeletal muscle tissue.

TI  - The dental student as technician: an 18-year follow-up of clinical laboratory programs.  
AB  - In 1977, a survey of American and Canadian dental schools was conducted by Weintraub to determine the delegation of laboratory procedures in preclinical and clinical complete and removable partial denture programs. This was performed in light of challenges raised to the value of requiring dental students, rather than laboratory technicians, to perform the various laboratory procedures involved in the fabrication of complete and removable partial dentures. Since 1977, the rate of edentulism has declined in the United States, and fewer edentulous patients have sought regular dental care. In addition, approximately 20% fewer curriculum hours have been spent in dental schools in removable prosthodontic instruction; a declining number of graduating dental students have felt comfortable with their level of knowledge of removable prosthodontics, especially complete dentures, and have performed fewer removable prosthodontic procedures in practice because of a perceived lack of treatment cost-effectiveness. The present study, an 18-year follow-up to the 1977 survey, was designed to determine if such trends toward a de-emphasis on removable prosthodontic treatment have affected the mechanisms of instruction in and the extent to which dental schools instruct students about removable-prosthodontics laboratory procedures. The 1995 survey was mailed to 53 American dental schools. Forty-six schools returned the completed survey, for a response rate of 87%. Results showed that the relative amount of material presented to students in clinical removable prosthodontics programs increased, primarily through the enhancement of laboratory technician support, both in-house and commercial, of student clinical removable prosthodontic laboratory procedures. The increase was greater than in preclinical removable prosthodontic programs, which were described in a companion article. The conflict between these outcomes and the call by the dental community, as well as that of the 1995 Institute of Medicine Study, for a reduced emphasis on teaching students about the technical details involved in removable prosthesis fabrication is recognized and explored.

TI  - Kinetic studies on the immobilization of antibodies to high-performance liquid chromatographic supports.  
AB  - Several factors can potentially affect the rate of immobilization of proteins onto solid supports, such as those used in affinity-based high-performance liquid chromatography. This study examined several of these factors and their influence on the coupling of periodate-treated rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies to dihydrazide-activated silica. Items considered included the number of potential coupling sites on the antibodies, the density of activated sites on the support, the relative amount of antibody combined with the support, and the density of the overall reaction slurry. In each case, the rate of change in the solution-phase antibody concentration gave biphasic behavior which could be described by two competing pseudo-first-order reactions. The overall immobilization rate was essentially independent of the density of the support's activated sites (when present at a coverage of 0.1-0.4 micromol/m2) but was strongly influenced by the number of available coupling groups on the antibodies. Increasing the slurry density had no appreciable effect on the immobilization rate, and the reaction rate showed only a small change when using different types of reagents for support activation (e.g., adipic vs oxalic dihydrazide). These results are consistent with a mechanism in which the rate-limiting step during immobilization is the covalent attachment of antibodies to the support and not mass transfer of antibodies to the support's surface.

AB  - The safety and antifungal efficacy of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) were evaluated in 556 cases of invasive fungal infection treated through an open-label, single-patient, emergency-use study of patients who were refractory to or intolerant of conventional antifungal therapy. All 556 treatment episodes were evaluable for safety. During the course of ABLC therapy, serum creatinine levels significantly decreased from baseline (P < .02). Among 162 patients with serum creatinine values > or = 2.5 mg/dL at the start of ABLC therapy (baseline), the mean serum creatinine value decreased significantly from the first week through the sixth week (P < or = .0003). Among the 291 mycologically confirmed cases evaluable for therapeutic response, there was a complete or partial response to ABLC in 167 (57%), including 42% (55) of 130 cases of aspergillosis, 67% (28) of 42 cases of disseminated candidiasis, 71% (17) of 24 cases of zygomycosis, and 82% (9) of 11 cases of fusariosis. Response rates varied according to the pattern of invasive fungal infection, underlying condition, and reason for enrollment (intolerance versus progressive infection). These findings support the use of ABLC in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are intolerant of or refractory to conventional antifungal therapy.

TI  - When children cannot remain home: foster family care and kinship care.  
AB  - Despite the best efforts of child welfare agencies, community agencies, and individuals, some children are not safe in their homes and must be placed in substitute care settings by child welfare authorities. Increasingly, as this article points out, child welfare agencies are placing children in the homes of their relatives rather than in traditional foster family homes (31% of all children in out-of-home care in the early 1990s were living with kin). This article discusses how such factors as the availability of foster homes, the demand for foster care, attitudes toward the extended families of troubled parents, and policies regarding payment for the costs of care have contributed to the rapid growth in kinship foster care. It discusses differences in the personal characteristics of kin and traditional foster parents and in the supports provided to the caregivers by child welfare agencies. Research findings suggest that kinship homes can promote the child welfare goals of protecting children and supporting families, but they are less likely to facilitate the prompt achievement of legal permanence for children. To forge a coherent policy toward kinship caregivers, officials must balance the natural strengths of informal, private exchanges among family members with the power of government agencies to provide both resources and oversight.

TI  - Morphology and differentiation of the coelomocytes of the free-living stages of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis.  
AB  - With the use of observations on living and fixed and stained larvae of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis reared in charcoal-feces cultures, an integrated view is presented on the morphology and differentiation of the coelomocytes present in the body cavity of the 2 rhabditiform stages and the exsheathed third stage. Four coelomocytes are present in the newly hatched larva arranged linearly from the base of the esophagus to the genital primordium. They lie subventrally, the anterior 2 on the right side of the ventral nerve cord, the posterior 2 on the left side. Data on the growth of these cells and analysis of their fixed site location in the coelom are presented. The coelomocytes are firmly attached to the inner surface of the body wall by filopodia. However, aberrantly positioned coelomocytes suggest the possibility that detachment and migration may occur. A few minute cytoplasmic inclusions are present in the coelomocytes in living newly hatched larvae and may reach approximately 100 or more in each coelomocyte in the third stage. These inclusions exhibit 2 phases of a pigmentation process. They are colorless in the rhabditiform stages, but simultaneous with the initiation of the second molt to form the infective larva, the inclusions rapidly turn a pink to rose hue. A variety of previous experimental data strongly support the interpretation that the pigment represents an extraordinary concentration of vitamin B12 in the coelomocytes obtained by larval feeding on bacterial B12 synthesizers present in the charcoal-feces cultures.

TI  - Imidazoles suppress rat testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid formation In vivo.  
AB  - The aim of these studies was to examine the effects of imidazoles on testosterone secretion and testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) formation through measurement of serum LH, serum testosterone, TIF testosterone, and TIF volumes. Imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, 4-methylimidazole (4-MI), and ketoconazole, an oral imidazole antifungal agent, caused dose-dependent decreases in testosterone secretion and TIF formation. Imidazole, 2-methylimidazole, and 4-MI decreased LH secretion. 4-MI decreased testosterone secretion 1-6 h after injection, increased testosterone at 8-16 h, decreased LH secretion at 4 h, decreased TIF volumes at 1-8 h, and slightly increased TIF volumes at 24 h. 4-MI blocked the stimulatory effects of hCG on testosterone secretion and prevented an expected increase in LH secretion after the 4-MI-induced decrease in testosterone secretion. 4-MI also reversed the effects of three other stimulants of testosterone secretion that presumably act through three different testicular regulatory systems: N-methyl-D,L-aspartate, an excitatory amino acid; NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. These results support the hypothesis that imidazoles inhibit testicular function and male reproductive function through inhibition of testosterone secretion, TIF formation, and LH secretion regulatory systems.

TI  - Micropuncture measurements of interstitial fluid pressure in rat nasal mucosa during early inflammatory reactions.  
AB  - Interstitial fluid pressure (Pif) has been studied in rat nasal mucosa during early inflammatory reactions induced by dextran anaphylaxis and local application of histamine. Pif was measured by using sharpened micropipettes connected to a servo-controlled counterpressure system. Access to the nasal mucosa was obtained from the facial side of the head through a small cavity drilled in the nasal bone. During dextran anaphylaxis, Pif increased significantly from control values of 2.2 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.21 mmHg (P < 0.05) within 1 h. Corresponding Pif values for histamine were 1.6 +/- 0.9 and 2.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (P < 0.05), respectively. These measurements support the hypothesis that a major driving force for the rapid exudation across inflamed respiratory mucosa is a hydrostatic pressure gradient created by increased mucosa Pif. When the transvascular fluid shifts accompanying the inflammatory reactions are prevented by circulatory arrest, Pif decreased significantly to subatmospheric values, -0.8 +/- 0.8 and -3.3 +/- 1.2 mmHg in the dextran and histamine group, respectively (P < 0.05). The decrease in Pif in the nasal mucosa after inflammatory stimuli, during circulatory arrest, provides further evidence for "active" modulation of Pif through changes in mechanical properties of the interstitial matrix. The decrease in Pif seen under these circumstances reveals a possible mechanism participating in the rapid and initial edema formation after inflammatory provocations.

AB  - Research in the field of Psychooncology has yielded useful data that may be helpful in clinical practice and in minimising psychosocial distress among breast cancer patients and their families. After the initial crisis following the diagnosis, the majority of patients adjust fairly well by mobilizing personal resources and social support. Adjustment may be enhanced by promoting open communication, offering support to the patient as to the whole family, and by aiding them in decision making. Comparisons of mastectomy to breast conservation have not consistently favored one surgery for all women, therefore, patients should be given the option to choose their preferred type of surgery. Since 20-30% of patients experience long-standing distress, early identification of patients at risk for severe adjustment disorders is important to provide them with professional support. Various kinds of psychosocial interventions have proven to be effective in reducing distress and improving patients' quality of life.

TI  - Regression of cellular hypertrophy after left ventricular assist device support [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although multiple studies have shown that the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) improves distorted cardiac geometry, the pathological mechanisms of the "reverse remodeling" of the heart are unknown. Our goal was to determine the effects of LVAD support on cardiac myocyte size and shape. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated myocytes were obtained at cardiac transplantation from 30 failing hearts (12 ischemic, 18 nonischemic) without LVAD support, 10 failing hearts that received LVAD support for 75+/-15 days, and 6 nonfailing hearts. Cardiac myocyte volume, length, width, and thickness were determined by use of previously validated techniques. Isolated myocytes from myopathic hearts exhibited increased volume, length, width, and length-to-thickness ratio compared with normal myocytes (P<0.05). However, there were no differences in any parameter between myocytes from ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathic hearts. Long-term LVAD support resulted in a 28% reduction in myocyte volume, 20% reduction in cell length, 20% reduction in cell width, and 32% reduction in cell length-to-thickness ratio (P<0.05). In contrast, LVAD support was associated with no change in cell thickness. These cellular changes were associated with reductions in left ventricular dilation and left ventricular mass measured echocardiographically in 6 of 10 LVAD-supported patients. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that the regression of cellular hypertrophy is a major contributor to the "reverse remodeling" of the heart after LVAD implantation. The favorable alterations in geometry that occur in parallel fashion at both the organ and cellular levels may contribute to reduced wall stress and improved mechanical performance after LVAD support.

TI  - Preparedness of practicing pediatricians in Louisiana to manage emergencies.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveys in recent years show that office emergencies are likely to occur in pediatric offices and that most offices are not equipped to deal with these situations. METHODS: To determine the pediatrician's preparedness to manage emergencies, we surveyed a randomly selected sample of 240 office-based pediatricians in Louisiana. We asked for information about basic and advanced cardiac life support training of the physicians and staff, availability of office equipment and medications, prearranged emergency plans, and staff preparedness. RESULTS: Only 73% of pediatricians were trained in pediatric advanced life support (PALS).  Of all support staff, only 48% were trained in basic life support, and 30% were trained in PALS. The most common deficiencies in equipment included intraosseous needles (62%), endotracheal tubes (54%), oxygen tanks (39%), intravenous catheters (29%), and nebulizers (22%). Availability of medications ranged from 75% for epinephrine 1:1,000 to 22% for calcium chloride. Although two thirds of the pediatricians had designed emergency plans for their offices, only 20% were conducting mock drills. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiencies exist among pediatricians and office staff regarding appropriate levels of preparedness to handle pediatric emergencies. Recommendations are made to attain appropriate levels of preparedness.

AB  - There is an age-associated decline in the activity of the GH-IGFs system. However, so far, it has not been studied, whether this decline in somatotrophic activity might be preventable by intensive exercising. We studied 11 elderly male (50-78 years) marathon runners and 10 age-matched male (52-73 years) sedentary controls to evaluate plasma concentrations of GH, total and free IGF-I and IGF-II and of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3 and insulin. When comparing the two groups (runners vs controls) no differences were found in GH (1.0 +/- 1.2 vs 1.3 +/- 1.3 microg/l [mean +/- SD]), IGF-1 (115 +/- 23 vs 113 +/- 21 microg/l), IGF-II (961 +/- 192 vs 864 +/- 125 microg/l), free IGF-1 (227 +/- 80 vs 318 +/- 146 ng/l), free IGF-II (563 +/- 249 vs 492 +/- 108 ng/l), IGFBP-3 (2403 +/- 515 vs 2307 +/- 326 microg/l) or insulin (26 +/- 13 vs 27 +/- 18 mU/l). However, IGFBP-1 (4.44 +/- 2.61 vs 2.28 +/- 0.93 microg/l) and IGFBP-2 (493 +/- 143 vs 340 +/- 186 microg/l) were found to be significantly increased in marathon runners. In conclusion, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the age-associated decline in GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 may be preventable by intensive endurance training. However, marathon running affects the regulation of the GH-IGFs system activity at the level of IGFBP-1 and -BP-2.

Genetic analysis revealed that the cream yellow coat color phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutant gene on chromosome 13. A preliminary study with biochemical and histologic examinations showed that cream yellow hair contained more fatty acid than unaffected normal hair and a large number of lipid droplets accumulated in parenchyma cells of the liver in mutant mice, as early as the age of 32 days old, suggesting that the cream yellow coat color was due to unusual lipid metabolism. The locus was designated cream fur locus and was given the gene symbol crf. In addition, it was found that recombination frequencies in the vicinity of the region of the crf locus were markedly different between male and female meiosis.

TI  - OSHA's renewed mandate for regulatory flexibility review: in support of the 1984 ethylene oxide standard.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that all federal agencies consider the impact of regulations on small entities. One of the provisions of the Act requires review of regulations ever 10 years to determine whether such regulations should be continued without changes, rescinded, or amended to make them more effective or less burdensome on businesses. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 amended and expanded the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Most significantly, SBREFA entitles aggrieved small entities or their representative (e.g., trade associations) to sue OSHA for failure to fulfill Regulatory Flexibility Act requirements. In response to this new political reality, OSHA held the first public meeting of their kind in June of 1997 to gather information on the ethylene oxide and lock-out/tag-out standards for the purposes of Regulatory Flexibility review. METHOD: This paper presents the development of the Regulatory Flexibility review process and details our analysis of the ethylene oxide standard using OSHA's eight Regulatory Flexibility review criteria. RESULTS: Great progress in ethylene oxide health and safety has been made since the promulgation of the standard in 1984, including a considerable decrease in average workshift exposures. Yet, important concerns remain, such as the lack of safer substitutes for EtO's most common uses, the widespread occurrence of accidental exposures to EtO that are not captured by personal monitoring, and the recent increase in the occurrence of catastrophic EtO explosions. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the considerable study that has been devoted to EtO and to the EtO standard, there is a very strong cases for either making the EtO standard more worker protective, or continuing the standard without change while improving outreach and enforcement efforts to address shortcomings. Other valuable standards for which fewer data exist may be inappropriately threatened by the Regulatory Flexibility review process. Importantly, Regulatory Flexibility review could be constructive if accompanied by appropriations to fund sound evaluation studies. Instead, it will likely divert OSHA's limited resources from the numerous urgent health hazard that await initial rule-making. As signified by the designation of "intervention effectiveness research" as one of the 21 priorities on the National Occupational Research Agenda, evaluation studies of OSHA standards and other interventions are urgently needed. The occupational health community's response to this need will play a crucial role in preserving hard-won protections, as well as in developing other urgently needed protections in the future.

TI  - Sedation for intractable distress in the dying--a survey of experts.  
AB  - Terminal sedation is a phrase that has appeared in the palliative care literature in the last few years. There has not been a clear definition proposed for this term, nor has there been any agreement on the frequency with which the technique is used. A postal survey of 61 selected palliative care experts (59 physicians, two nurses) was carried out to examine their response to a proposed definition for 'terminal sedation', to estimate the frequency of this practice and the reasons for its use, to identify the drugs and dosages used, to determine the outcome, and to explore the decision-making process. Opinions on physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia were also sought. Eighty-seven per cent of the experts responded from eight countries, although predominantly from Canada and the United Kingdom. Forty per cent agreed unequivocally with the proposed definition, while 4% disagreed completely. Eighty-nine per cent agreed that 'terminal sedation' is sometimes necessary and 77% reported using it in the last 12 months--over half of these for up to four patients. Reasons for using this method included various physical and psychological symptoms. The most common drugs used were midazolam and methotrimeprazine. Decision making usually involved the patient or family, and varied with respect to the ease with which the decision was made. The use of sedation was perceived to be successful in 90 out of 100 patients recalled. Ninety per cent of respondents did not support legalization of euthanasia. In conclusion, sedating agents are used by palliative care experts as tools for the management of symptoms. The term 'terminal sedation' should be abandoned and replaced with the phrase 'sedation for intractable distress in the dying'. Further research into the management of intractable symptoms and suffering is warranted.

One hypothesis is that specific caveolin-caveolin interactions regulate the size of caveolae, as caveolin-1 undergoes two stages of self-oligomerization. To test this hypothesis directly, we have created two caveolin-1 deletion mutants that lack regions of caveolin-1 that are involved in directing the self-assembly of caveolin-1 oligomers. More specifically, Cav-1 delta61-100 lacks a region of the N-terminal domain that directs the formation of high molecular mass caveolin-1 homo-oligomers, while Cav-1 deltaC lacks a complete C-terminal domain that is required to allow caveolin homo-oligomers to interact with each other, forming a caveolin network. It is important to note that these two mutants retain an intact transmembrane domain. Our current results show that although Cav-1 delta61-100 and Cav-1 deltaC are competent to drive vesicle formation, these vesicles vary widely in their size and shape with diameters up to 500-1000 nm. In addition, caveolin-induced vesicle formation appears to be isoform-specific. Recombinant expression of caveolin-2 under the same conditions failed to drive the formation of vesicles, while caveolin-3 expression yielded caveolae-sized vesicles. These results are consistent with the previous observation that in transformed NIH 3T3 cells that lack caveolin-1 expression, but continue to express caveolin-2, no morphologically distinguishable caveolae are observed. In addition, as caveolin-2 alone exists mainly as a monomer or homo-dimer, while caveolins 1 and 3 exist as high molecular mass homo-oligomers, our results are consistent with the idea that the formation of high molecular mass oligomers of caveolin are required to regulate the formation of uniform caveolae-sized vesicles.  In direct support of this notion, regulated induction of caveolin-1 expression in transformed NIH 3T3 cells was sufficient to recruit caveolin-2 to caveolae membranes. The ability of caveolin-1 to recruit caveolin-2 most likely occurs through a direct interaction between caveolins 1 and 2, as caveolins 1 and 2 are normally co-expressed and interact with each other to form high molecular mass hetero-oligomers containing both caveolins 1 and 2.

TI  - Comparison of inactivation and conformational changes of native and apo yeast alcohol dehydrogenase during thermal denaturation.  
AB  - The conformational changes of native and apo yeast alcohol dehydrogenase during thermal denaturation have been followed by fluorescence emission and circular dichroism spectra. A comparison of inactivation and conformational changes during thermal denaturation shows that for the native enzyme and for the apo-I YADH which has the conformational zinc removed, the extent of inactivation was larger than the extent of conformational changes at the same temperature. This result supported the suggestion by Tsou (Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986, 11, 427-429: Science 1993, 262, 380-381) that the enzyme active site is more flexible. The results also show that apo-I YADH without the conformational zinc was more easily inactivated with increasing incubation temperature, indicating that the stability of the apo-I YADH decreased. Kinetic analysis suggest that the substrate does not provide any protective effect during thermal inactivation of native and apo-I YADH.

TI  - Do bereaved children consult the primary health care team more frequently?  
AB  - It is known that 2% of all children are bereaved of a parent before the age of 18, but there is little support available for these bereaved children in the community. It is not known if these children consult the primary health care team more frequently than their non-bereaved peers. A record-based, case-controlled pilot study of 13 bereaved children over a 2-year period was carried out in a group general practice. All children had been bereaved of a father through malignant disease, and were from seven families. Children who had been bereaved of a parent attended the surgery more frequently than their age/sex-matched controls. There was an observed increase in the frequency of consultations both in the year preceding and following the bereavement. Post-bereavement, over one-third of consultations were for symptoms for which no organic cause could be found. The support needs of these bereaved children did not appear to be addressed. Further research is required to investigate the optimum means of providing support by the primary health care team for the small but significant number of children who are bereaved each year.

AB  - The study of tooth crown variables has proven useful in the assessment of human origin and dispersal. I show that multivariate analysis of quantified total tooth structure from dental X-rays is a powerful phylogenetic methodology. From an analysis of the complex global dental phenotype ("GDP," composed of approximately 30 root, pulp, crown, and enamel variables per tooth), a representative Western European population was found to associate with Southeast Asians, while Mongolians formed a tight cluster with all Native Americans. The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modern humans from an emigrant African hominid. Both hypotheses portend an early evolution of the European genotype and support the argument that Europeans are principally derived from Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and thus Middle East Neolithic people did not have a major genetic impact on Europeans.

TI  - Biological affinities and adaptations of Bronze Age Bactrians: III. An initial craniometric assessment.  
AB  - Discovery of a previously unknown Bronze Age civilization (Oxus Civilization) centered on the oases of Central Asia immediately raised questions concerning the origin and interregional impacts of this civilization. Fifteen craniometric variables from 12 Bronze Age samples--encompassing 544 adults from Central Asia, Iran, the Indus Valley, and Anatolia--are compared to test which, if any, of the current hypotheses offered by archaeologists are best supported by the pattern of phenetic affinities possessed by the Oxus Civilization inhabitants of the north Bactrian oasis. Craniometric differences between samples are compared with Mahalanobis generalized distance, and patterns of phenetic affinity are assessed with two types of cluster analysis (WPGMA, neighbor-joining method), multidimensional scaling, and principal coordinates analysis. Results obtained by this analysis indicate that current hypotheses for both the origin and interregional impacts of Oxus Civilization populations are incomplete.

TI  - A test of the demand-control/support model of work stress in correctional officers.  
AB  - The demand-control/support model of work stress was tested in a sample of 419 correctional officers. The results suggest a link between certain work characteristics (high demands, low control, and low support) and strain symptoms (e.g., psychological distress, job dissatisfaction) as well as with negative affectivity (NA). On the other hand, other job characteristics (high demands and high control) were associated with positive behavioral outcomes (seeking feedback, looking at work as a challenge). Workers in high-isolation strain jobs with the greatest work exposure showed higher levels of strain and NA than workers with less experience working in the same job. Results suggest that work experience may affect long-term personality evolution. It is concluded that studies that control for the nuisance aspects of trait NA may underestimate the impact of the work environment on strain.

TI  - Speech discrimination in the sensorineural hearing loss patient: how is it affected by background noise?  
AB  - There are patients who have normal hearing below 3,000 Hz and normal speech discrimination who still complain of hearing difficulty, especially when background noise is present. The objective of this study is to document the fact that these individuals have a significant hearing impairment that is not detected with routine testing. We retrospectively reviewed 67 audiograms selected for 50-dB loss or greater at 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz and speech discrimination scores better than 80%. Patients in this group had also previously undergone speech discrimination testing in the presence of 50-dB calibrated cafeteria noise at the time of the initial audiogram. Identical testing was carried out on 48 control subjects without hearing loss. The speech discrimination scores of the hearing-impaired group were lower than in the control group when tested in a quiet booth (88.2 and 98.2%, respectively). The significant finding was the change in the speech discrimination score when tested in noise. We found that the study group had a 33.1% loss in speech discrimination when tested in the presence of background noise. The control group had only a 5.2% loss in speech discrimination in the presence of the same noisy background; this was statistically different (p = 0.001). Our conclusion is that patients complaining of hearing loss who have normal low- to mid-frequency hearing and good speech discrimination should be tested in the presence of noise to adequately document their degree of impairment. Our findings also support the theories of signal attenuation and secondary auditory pathway distortions as causes of the loss of speech discrimination.

TI  - Seattle YouthCare's prevention, intervention, and education program: a model of care for HIV-positive, homeless, and at-risk youth.  
AB  - YouthCare's project for youth who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive or at high risk for becoming HIV positive is one of 10 supported by Special Projects of National Significance Program, HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration. Throughout its 23-year history, YouthCare has focused on serving runaway, homeless, sexual minority, and other youth "on the margins." To respond effectively to the needs of these youth, YouthCare has developed creative service approaches including involving youth in program design and taking the programs to where the youth live. Building on this experience, the agency developed a continuum of services which has provided care to 906 youth, including 37 who are HIV positive. The five major elements of the model include: (a) youth-specific HIV antibody test counseling, (b) outreach, (c) intensive case management for HIV-positive youth, (d) prevention services for youth at high risk of HIV infection, and (e) peer involvement. Quantitative evaluation helped in identifying youth served by the project (e.g., over one third self-identify as a sexual minority) and the sites at which services should be provided. Preliminary results from qualitative evaluations have stressed the importance of teamwork in designing clinical interventions and providing support to direct-service staff. This report's conclusion stresses that case management for this population, even though time and resource-intensive, is effective, and that services need to be flexible and tailored to each client's needs.

TI  - Cloning and expression of beta-glucosidase genes in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using shuttle vector pYES 2.0.  
AB  - Genes for beta-glucosidase (Bgl) isolated from a genomic library of the cellulolytic bacterium, Cellulomonas biazotea, were cloned in pUC18 in its SacI cloning site and transformed to E. coli. Ten putative recombinants showed blackening zones on esculin plates, yellow zones on pNPG plates, in liquid culture and on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis activity gels. They fell into three distinct groups. Three representative E. coli clones carried recombinant plasmids designated pRM54, pRM1 and pRM17. The genes were located on 5.6-, 3.7- and 1.84-kb fragments, respectively. Their location was obtained by deletion analysis which revealed that 5.5, 3.2, and 1.8 kb fragments were essential to code for BglA, BglB, and BglC, respectively, and conferred intracellular production of beta-glucosidase on E. coli. Expression of the bgl genes resulted in overproduction of beta-glucosidase in the three clones. Secretion occurred into the periplasmic fractions. Three inserts carrying bgl genes from the representative recombinant E. coli were isolated with SacI, ligated in the shuttle vector pYES 2.0 in its SacI site and transformed to E. coli and S. cerevisiae. The recombinant plasmids were redesignated pRPG1, pRPG2 and pRPG3 coding for BglA1, BglB1 and BglC1. The cloned genes conferred extracellular production of beta-glucosidase on S. cerevisiae and enabled it to grow on cellobiose and salicin. The gall promoter of shuttle vector pYES 2.0 enabled the organisms to produce twice more beta-glucosidase than that supported by the lacZ-promoter of pUC18 plasmid in E. coli. The cloned gene can be used as a selection marker for introducing recombinant plasmids in wild strains of S. cerevisiae. The enzyme produced by bgl+ yeast and E. coli recombinants resembles that of the donor with respect to temperature and pH requirement for maximum activity. Other enzyme properties of the beta-glucosidases from S. cerevisiae were substantially the same as those from C. biazotea.

TI  - Outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by nonventricular arrhythmias: contribution of successful resuscitation to overall survivorship supports the current practice of initiating out-of-hospital ACLS [see comments]  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies indicate that ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are no longer the most common rhythms initially documented in out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death. Although the outcome from asystole and rhythms designated as pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is reported as poor (approximately 1% survival), resuscitative efforts for these patients are still encouraged. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential contribution that this patient group makes to overall survivorship. METHODS: During this 2-year prospective study, all patients in cardiopulmonary arrest who were transported to the study institution after out-of-hospital Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) interventions were considered eligible for inclusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age and those in posttraumatic arrest were excluded. Age, sex, first-documented arrest rhythm, presence of a witness to the arrest, performance of bystander CPR, survival to hospital discharge, and functional status at discharge were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients met the inclusion criteria. The initial rhythm was VF/VT in 59 (30%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24% to 37%) and asystole/PEA in 138 (70%; 95% CI, 64% to 76%). There was 1 hospital survivor in the VT/VF group; 9 patients (7%; 95% CI, 4% to 13%) in the asystole/PEA group survived to hospital discharge. Of the asystole/PEA survivors, 100% (95% CI, 66% to 100%) had a witnessed arrest and 56% (95% CI, 21% to 86%) received bystander CPR. Fifty-six percent (95% CI, 21% to 86%) of the asystole/PEA survivors were discharged at a functional level equivalent to that preceding arrest. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients in asystole/PEA comprised 90% of the survivors. The outcome for patients with asystole/PEA whose arrest was witnessed and who received bystander CPR may be greater than previously estimated and supports the current practice of initiating aggressive out-of-hospital ACLS in this patient group.

Topics discussed included structures and biosynthesis of endogenous digitalis-like factors (EDLF), biologic activities, physiology function and role of EDLF in hypertension, and novel natriuretic factors. Progress was reported in determining the exact structure of an isomer of ouabain isolated from bovine hypothalamus. Evidence was presented supporting the existence of a second mammalian EDLF that resembles steroids found in toads (bufodienolides).  Support for endogenous synthesis of mammalian EDLF was also presented. Mammalian EDLF were reported to have effects which are different from those possessed by digitalis like steroids derived from plants. New evidence was presented implicating EDLF in various forms of hypertension in humans and animal models. Finally, several unique natriuretic factors that do not inhibit Na, K ATPase and that appear to play a role in mammalian volume regulation were discussed.

TI  - Well-being of haemophilia patients: a model for direct and indirect effects of medical parameters on the physical and psychosocial functioning.  
AB  - This study outlines the development and evaluation of a structural equation model for establishing the consequences of haemophilia. The hereditary disorder is characterized by a high tendency to haemorrhages, with recurrent bleeding into the joints causing irreversible joint damage. The model is, in general, an attempt to answer the following questions: what is the effect of haemophilia on the well-being (i.e. satisfaction, health, somatic complaints and self-esteem) of patients and what is the additional or mediating role of other individual characteristics in this pathway? Disease severity, joint impairment and disability are defined as antecedents of well-being and the mediating roles of appraisal (i.e. the personal evaluation of the disease), health beliefs (i.e. locus of control), psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety, anger, depression and optimism) and social support are investigated. Psychological variables turned out to be the strongest determinants of well-being and partly mediated the detrimental effect of disability on well-being. The role of appraisal remained somewhat unclear, as no significant relationship was established between this personal evaluation of haemophilia and well-being. Nevertheless, appraisal very well reflected the level of disability. An internal locus of control and favourable psychological characteristics appeared to reduce the perceived seriousness of haemophilia. No evidence was found for social support to act as a mediator between disability and well-being. The perception of support did show moderately strong associations with psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety and depression) and satisfaction ratings. The study merits further research on quantifying the relationships between clinical parameters and psychosocial outcomes in patients with a chronic disease.

TI  - Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Study (PATHS): effects of an alcohol treatment program on blood pressure [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether blood pressure is reduced for at least 6 months with an intervention to lower alcohol intake in moderate to heavy drinkers with above optimal to slightly elevated diastolic blood pressure, and whether reduction of alcohol intake can be maintained for 2 years. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Six hundred forty-one outpatient veterans with an average intake of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day in the 6 months before entry into the study and with diastolic blood pressure 80 to 99 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral alcohol reduction intervention program or a control observation group for 15 to 24 months. The goal of the intervention was the lower of 2 or fewer drinks daily or a 50% reduction in intake. A subgroup with hypertension was defined as having a diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 99 mm Hg, or 80 to 99 mm Hg if recently taking medication for hypertension. RESULTS: Reduction in average weekly self-reported alcohol intake was significantly greater (P<.001) at every assessment from 3 to 24 months in the intervention group vs the control group: levels declined from 432 g/wk at baseline by 202 g/wk in the intervention group and from 445 g/wk by 78 g/wk in the control group in the first 6 months, with similar reductions after 24 months. The intervention group had a 1.2/0.7-mm Hg greater reduction in blood pressure than the control group (for each, P = .17 and P = .18) for the 6-month primary end point; for the hypertensive stratum the difference was 0.9/0.7 mm Hg (for each, P = .58 and P = .44). CONCLUSIONS: The 1.3 drinks per day average difference between changes in self-reported alcohol intake observed in this trial produced only small nonsignificant effects on blood pressure. The results from the Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Study (PATHS) do not provide strong support for reducing alcohol consumption in nondependent moderate drinkers as a sole method for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.

TI  - The development of research methodology in homoeopathy.  
AB  - Homoeopathy is a form of complementary medicine based on treating 'like with like'. Its popularity with the public, and credibility with health professionals, has increased rapidly as a result of recent clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy. The results of a systematic review of clinical trials of homoeopathy are summarized. The main scientific obstacle to the acceptance of homoeopathy is its use of very high 'ultramolecular' dilutions. The action of these dilutions cannot be explained in terms of existing pharmacological concepts. This has lead to the 'information medicine' hypothesis, which postulates the storage of information in water and its transmission to sensitized biosystems. This hypothesis is starting to be supported by physics. 'Proving' drugs in order to determine their effects on healthy volunteers is a form of research practised by homoeopaths for 200 years, the methodology is continuing to evolve. Clinical trials in homoeopathy are complicated by the fact that treatment is highly individualised. Various approaches to the problem of individualization in controlled trials, including 'homoeopathy as indicated', 'single homoeopathic medicine' and 'individualized isopathy' are discussed. To improve homoeopathic practice its results should be critically audited, a method for doing this is described.
