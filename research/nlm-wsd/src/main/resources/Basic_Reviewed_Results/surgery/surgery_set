AB  - A patient presented with chest pain, fever, and chills and developed a large pleural effusion while receiving antibiotic therapy. On a CT scan of the chest, multiple loculi of fluid were noted, and at surgery, a complex empyema with an associated bronchopleural fistula related to a granulomatous process in the lower lobe of the right lung was demonstrated. Cultures revealed Histoplasma capsulatum in the pleural fluid as well as in the pulmonary parenchymal process.

TI  - A spurious correlation between hospital mortality and complication rates: the importance of severity adjustment.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: When two outcome measures, such as mortality and complication rates, are intended to measure the same underlying quantity (in this case hospital quality of care), one expects they will be highly correlated. In addition, as data quality improves, one expects the correlation will increase. The authors show that these expectations are, in a significant way, mistaken. METHODS: The authors study two outcomes (hospital mortality and complication rates after surgery) using three predictive models that vary in adjustment for severity of illness. RESULTS: Two hospital rankings, based on each of the two outcomes, are well correlated when not adjusted for severity. However, as clinical data are added to the models, the correlation tends to disappear. The authors explain this based on assumptions regarding the relative size of the partial correlations between mortality, complication rate, and severity covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Before claims of construct validity can be made, investigators must show that correlations between outcomes purporting to measure quality of care are sustained after adequate correction for severity. Most importantly, it should be recognized that inadequately controlled confounding variables may lead to a spurious high correlation between an accepted and a new outcome measure, and a false sense of adequate construct validity.

TI  - Isolated talocalcaneal interposition fusion: a prospective follow-up study.  
AB  - This is a prospective clinical and radiological study of the treatment of talocalcaneal deformity or degeneration by a modified technique of isolated talocalcaneal fusion. Thirty-six patients were evaluated with clinical examination, plain dorsoplantar and oblique radiographs, and computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging in a follow-up of 32.5 months (range, 20-62 months). Indications for arthrodesis were posterior tibial tendon rupture with secondary osteoarthritis (12 cases) and secondary posttraumatic osteoarthritis (24 cases). On a visual analog pain scale, the patients graded their pain at 4.4 before surgery and at 1.1 after surgery. The subjective results were 33% complete satisfaction, 28% satisfaction with minor reservation, 31% satisfaction with major reservation, and 9% dissatisfaction. The overall objective results were excellent in 47%, good in 31%, fair in 17%, and poor in 6% of cases. A further advantage of this type of talocalcaneal fusion is a large remaining range of motion in the neighboring joints, at the ankle (in 76% the same or better ROM than before surgery), and at Chopart's joint (in 69% the same or better ROM than before surgery). The fusion rate was high (95%).

TI  - Cost analysis of current therapies for limited coronary artery revascularization.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single or double (limited) coronary artery revascularization using percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass (CAB) surgery has recently been enhanced with further innovation in intracoronary stenting and the emergence of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) grafting. Resource allocation for all modalities is directly dependent on hospitalization costs, length of stay, and clinical results. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of 25 consecutive patients over 9 months at a single center received either PTCA, stenting, MIDCAB, or conventional CAB for single-vessel coronary disease, primarily of the left anterior descending circulation. Day, supply, and procedural charges were evaluated, along with the total hospital charge. Postprocedural length of stay was calculated and compared with a national database.  MIDCAB surgery day charges were less than stenting but greater than PTCA, MIDCAB supply charges were the least of all groups, and MIDCAB procedural charges were less than for conventional CAB. Total charges for MIDCAB grafting were less than for stenting but greater than for PTCA. Postprocedural length of stay for MIDCAB patients was equivalent to PTCA patients and significantly less than for stenting or for conventional CAB. CONCLUSIONS: MIDCAB grafting provides a new surgical approach that is comparable in charges to catheter-based interventions. The technique markedly reduces length of stay and perioperative morbidity. The selection of medical or surgical limited coronary revascularization can now be based primarily on clinical outcomes without consideration for associated resource allocation.

TI  - New model of colon interposition following distal gastrectomy in rats.  
AB  - An interposed colon segment has been clinically used as a gastric substitute following an esophagogastric resection for benign or malignant esophageal and gastric cardia disease. The purpose of this study is to establish a rat model of colonic interposition following distal gastrectomy and to investigate its serial mucosal changes. About 80% of the glandular stomach was resected, and a 3-cm segment of the transverse colon interposed isoperistaltically between the remnant stomach and duodenum. Epithelial proliferation and aberrant crypt foci in the interposed colon segment were investigated serially. Crypt lengths in the interposed colon increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared to the remnant colon. The number of goblet cells per crypt per 1 mm in the interposed colon also decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared to the remnant colon. A PCNA labeling index (LI) of the remnant colon was almost 30%. A PCNA LI in the interposed colon at 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery was 30.8%, 31.8%, and 47.8%, respectively. The PCNA LI in the interposed colon increased significantly (P < 0.05) 12 months after surgery compared to the remnant colon at 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery. Aberrant crypt foci were not detected in the interposed colon segment. In conclusion, we established a rat model of colonic interposition following distal gastrectomy. The interposed colon mucosa adapted well. Long-term mucosal changes of the interposed colon segment should now be studied.

TI  - Cost utility of routine imaging with Tc-99m-sestamibi in primary hyperparathyroidism before initial surgery.  
AB  - Tc-99m-sestamibi has been shown to localize parathyroid adenomas effectively, but controversy continues as to the use of this scan before initial surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. We analyzed the cost utility of obtaining this study before initial surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. Twenty-two consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent dual-phase Tc-99m-sestamibi scan before initial bilateral neck exploration. Surgical findings were correlated with the results of sestamibi scan. There were 15 women and 7 men, with a mean age of 50.5 years (range, 22-76). Preoperative mean total calcium was 11.74 mg/dL (range, 10-15), ionized calcium was 6.19 mg/dL (range, 5.2-7.7), and intact parathyroid hormone was 153.5 pg/mL (range, 83.1-551). Postoperative mean ionized calcium was 4.56 mg/dL (range, 4.1-5.57). Twenty sestamibi scans had a positive localization, and 2 scans had no localization. At surgery, 18 solitary adenomas, 3 diffuse hyperplasias, and 1 patient with four normal parathyroid glands were found. Sixteen sestamibi scans were true positive (solitary adenoma), 4 scans were false positive (2 diffuse hyperplasia, 1 wrong side, and 1 lymph node), 1 negative scan was true negative (diffuse hyperplasia), and 1 negative scan was false negative (adenoma). One patient (four normal glands) at the second operation had a supernumerary fifth gland adenoma excised from the mediastinum. Preoperative Tc-99m-sestamibi scan did not offer any advantage when a complete bilateral neck exploration is performed. Sixteen of (84%) adenomas were correctly localized, but 18 of 19 adenomas were in the neck and were easily found. The 1 ectopic adenoma was not found by scanning or with initial surgery. The 4 of 22 (18%) false-positive localizations and the 2 of 22 (9%) negative scans contributed nothing to the surgery. Of the 22 localizing sestamibi scans, surgery was not altered to affect the outcome. At a cost of $550 per sestamibi scan and with the error inherent in the scan, it is not cost effective to obtain Tc-99m-sestamibi scan before initial surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism.

METHODS: Herein we describe a 33-year-old patient who had undergone surgery for a right renal tumor at age 2 years and 10 months. A partial nephrectomy was performed because the patient had left ureterohydronephrosis. Histological analysis of the surgical specimen disclosed a nephroblastoma or Wilms' tumor. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The progressive deterioration of the left urinary tract, despite attempts to correct this condition, warranted its complete suppression. The patient has remained symptom-free and leads an active social and working life 31 years after the first operation, which makes this an exceptional case in the world literature.

TI  - Evaluation of the post-operative lumbar spine with MR imaging. The role of contrast enhancement and thickening in nerve roots.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Two new signs of lumbar nerve-root affection have been reported in recent years on the basis of MR examinations, namely: thickening in nerve roots; and contrast enhancement in nerve roots. The aim of this study was to assess contrast enhancement in nerve roots in a standardised way, and to evaluate the clinical significance of contrast enhancement and of nerve-root thickening in the symptomatic post-operative lumbar spine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients (who had previously been operated on for lumbar disc herniation) underwent 152 MR examinations, mainly on a 1.5 T system. Focal nerve-root enhancement was identified by visual assessment. Intradural enhancement was also quantified by pixel measurements that compared the affected nerve roots before and after contrast administration. Non-affected nerve roots were used as reference. RESULTS: Enhanced nerve roots in the dural sac increased at least 40-50% in signal intensity after contrast administration compared to pre-contrast images and also compared to non-affected nerve roots. Intradural nerve-root enhancement was seen in 10% of the patients and focal enhancement in the root sleeve was seen in a further 26%. Nerve-root thickening was seen in 30%. Good correlation with clinical symptoms was found in 59% of the patients with intradural enhancement, in 84% with focal enhancement, and in 86% with nerve-root thickening. The combination of thickening and enhancement in the nerve root correlated with symptoms in 86% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Nerve-root enhancement (whether focal or intradural) and thickening in the nerve root are significant MR findings in the post-operative lumbar spine. In combination with disc herniation or nerve-root displacement, these two signs may strengthen the indication for repeat surgery. However, root enhancement within 6 months of previous surgery may be a normal post-operative finding.

TI  - Labyrinthine fistula as a complication of cholesteatoma.  
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to present the authors' experience in the management of labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma. METHODS: The clinical charts of 92 patients who underwent surgical procedures for cholesteatoma complicated by labyrinthine fistula between 1979 and 1975 were reviewed retrospectively. In this period, 1,205 patients were operated on for cholesteatoma. In each patient, the site and size of the fistula were evaluated during surgery and the hearing thresholds were compared before and after surgery. RESULTS: The fistula involved the lateral semicircular canal in 71 patients. Multiple fistulas were observed in nine patients. Postoperative hearing levels were unchanged or improved in 83.7% of patients. Comparison between hearing outcomes and size of the fistula showed better findings when smaller size fistulas were found. No significant differences between open and closed techniques were detected. Favorable outcomes were obtained in patients treated with surgical obliteration of the interrupted labyrinth. CONCLUSIONS: The current study confirmed that careful manipulation of the labyrinthine fistula is mandatory to preserve hearing functions for these patients. According to the authors' experience, the future trend for fistula treatment could be directed toward less conservative techniques compared with the previous indications favoring methods of interruption and subsequent obliteration of the semicircular canals.

TI  - Effect of the NSAID flurbiprofen on remodelling after periodontal surgery.  
AB  - The aim of the present experiment was to assess the effect of the administration of the NSAID flurbiprofen (Froben) on tissue healing after periodontal surgery. Sites from patients with the same treatment modality (modified Widman flap) but receiving a placebo drug and sites within each patient not exposed to surgery served as controls. Nineteen patients suffering from moderate to severe periodontal disease were recruited and they signed informed consent forms. These patients required periodontal surgery as assessed at the periodontal re-evaluation. The sites chosen for the study were all diagnosed with PPD > or = 5 mm and were bleeding on probing. During the healing phase 10 patients received 50 mg Froben 3 times per day for 30 d whereas 9 patients received a placebo drug. Two sites with PPD > or = 5 mm after initial therapy and bleeding on probing served as surgical sites, whereas 2 similar sites were not exposed to surgery. The study design was set up double-blind. The radiographic examination consisted of 2-4 standardized vertical bitewings obtained at the periodontal re-evaluation (BL) at 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgically for digital subtraction and computer assisted densitometric image analysis (CADIA). The regions of interest analysed were mesial or distal crestal sites. Minimal remodelling activity was observed radiographically after periodontal surgery in both patient groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups of sites regarding the mean changes in density when analysing the pairs of radiographs 0-1, 0-3, 0-6 months. A frequency analysis was performed to list the number of sites with different ranges of density change. No differences in the distributions of the numbers of sites were observed when comparing the 4 site groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p > 0.05). A significant reduction of the probing pocket depth and a significant amount of clinical attachment gain was noted at the surgically treated sites irrespective of whether the patients had used flurbiprofen or placebo. Whereas the pathways leading to bone resorption in periodontally diseased sites have been shown, in other studies, to be influenced by NSAID, the results of the present study could not justify general administration of Froben for the purpose of reduction of bone resorption after periodontal surgical procedures in patients with adult periodontitis.

TI  - [Changes in surgical cases]  
AB  - The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time bearing an increased operative risk. Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients. Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also. Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed. New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure. Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures. Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet. Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly. From the physicians viewpoint we have actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.

TI  - Current management of small-bowel obstruction.  
AB  - In conclusion, most of the recent advances in the management of small bowel obstruction consist of developments in the imaging modalities available to assist in the diagnosis itself, particularly with regard to the distinction between partial and complete obstruction. Unfortunately, little progress has been made to enable physicians to detect early, reversible strangulation, and therefore the surgical management of small-bowel obstruction has changed very little over the past 10 years. Because of the inability to detect reversible ischemia, there is a substantial risk of progression to irreversible ischemia (and an inherent rise in morbidity and mortality) when surgery is delayed for an extended period of time, especially in the setting of suspected complete obstruction. However, almost all patients do benefit from an initial 12 to 24 hours of resuscitation and decompression in cases of complete obstruction; resuscitation and decompression can usually be extended for a longer period of time in those patients with partial obstruction who exhibit no signs of progression (Fig 6). It is encouraging, however, that some advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology and prevention of adhesion formation. Research efforts in the future should continue to focus on these issues as well as on the development of methods to better recognize early signs of strangulation.

TI  - Allopurinol dosage and effect on ischemia-reperfusion damage in elective and acute aortic surgery.  
AB  - To study the effect of a safe dosage of allopurinol on ischemia-reperfusion damage following aortic surgery, 24 patients undergoing either elective or acute aortic reconstruction, were randomized to receive allopurinol or placebo, yielding four groups: elective/placebo (EP), elective/allopurinol (EA), acute/placebo (AP) and acute/allopurinol (AA). Blood concentrations of allopurinol, oxypurinol, uric acid, malondialdehyde, ascorbic acid, and 99mTc-albumin were determined perioperatively. Adequate concentrations and biochemical activity of allopurinol and oxypurinol were obtained, without side-effects. Malondialdehyde did not increase perioperatively, but was significantly higher in acute surgery than in elective surgery intraoperatively. Yet, ascorbic acid levels and 99mTc-albumin disappearance were not different from groups EP and EA. No influence of allopurinol was found on malondialdehyde, ascorbic acid and 99mTc-albumin. An influence of allopurinol may have been obscured, as patients in group AA were more hypotensive than in group AP. In conclusion, adequate allopurinol concentration can be obtained with a safe dosage in abdominal aortic surgery. Signs of ischemia-reperfusion injury were found in acute surgery, not in elective surgery. Therefore, further investigation on the clinical effect of allopurinol is only useful in acute aortic surgery.

TI  - Postanesthetic hypotropia: a unique syndrome in left eyes [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate a recurring syndrome of postoperative hypotropia after cataract surgery performed under local anesthesia. SETTING: Hawaiian Eye Center, Wahiawa, Hawaii, USA. METHODS: Thirty-one left eyes in 2143 cataract surgeries developed postoperative hypotropia. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were performed by one surgeon; the anesthetic (containing bupivacaine) was administered by one anesthesiologist who had treated 4200 patients without incident. We conducted epidemiologic, outcomes, and prevention studies to identify the etiology, evaluate hypotropia treatment, and test specific anesthetic techniques, respectively. RESULTS: Changes in preoperative and intraoperative management and surgical methods were unsuccessful in preventing the hypotropia. In 55% of the cases, strabismus surgery was required and in 13%, prism glasses. Early recession of the inferior rectus and conjunctiva was successful. After repeated observations of the anesthetic technique, it was noted that the right-handed anesthesiologist misdirected the retrobulbar needle into the left orbit. This resulted in a change in the anesthetic technique, and there has been no incidence of postoperative hypotropia in 3000 surgeries. CONCLUSION: We believe this syndrome resulted from mytoxicity or perimuscular inflammation, producing contracture hypotropia and restricted elevation of the globe. We propose the term postbupivacaine hypotropia for this chiefly left-sided syndrome.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of cimetidine, sucralfate, and misoprostol for prevention of gastrointestinal tract bleeding in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding in dogs undergoing spinal surgery with adjunct corticosteroid treatment, and to determine the protective efficacy of cimetidine, sucralfate, and misoprostol against such bleeding in these dogs. ANIMALS: 40 dogs that underwent spinal surgery. PROCEDURES: Myelography and surgery were performed on the first or second day of hospitalization. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate was given at a dosage of 30 mg/kg of body weight prior to myelography, followed by a second full or half dose 2 to 4 hours later at clinician discretion. Spinal surgery was performed in conventional manner, postoperative administration of analgesics was done, and dogs were fed a diet lacking red meat. Dogs were assigned at random to 1 of the 3 treatment groups or to the control group. Dogs of the treatment groups received cimetidine, sucralfate, or misoprostol. Physical examination and determination of PCV and serum total protein values were performed daily. A fecal sample was examined daily for gross and occult blood. RESULTS: 36 of 40 dogs had GI tract bleeding during a hospitalization period of 3 to 6 days. There was no significant difference in development of bleeding between the control group and any of the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal tract bleeding occurred in 90% of dogs undergoing spinal surgery combined with administration of methylprednisilone sodium succinate, a higher rate than that found in previous studies. This bleeding was not life-threatening. Prophylactic benefit from any of the GI protectants tested was not found.

TI  - Postoperative dissociation of blood levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropin after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.  
AB  - The regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the operative and perioperative period of major surgical procedures is necessary for successful adaption to surgical stress. We report evidence on an altered response of HPA axis regulation in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), beta-endorphin, and cortisol were determined with radio-immune assay in 50 males for elective CABG surgery. The patients received general anesthesia using a balanced technique with sufentanil, isoflurane, and midazolam. Pre- and intraoperatively, there was no significant increase in plasma cortisol, ACTH, and beta-endorphin levels. On the evening of surgery, all plasma hormone levels were increased. On the evening of the first and second postoperative day, plasma ACTH and beta-endorphin levels returned to the preoperative baseline values. During the same time interval, plasma cortisol levels were significantly elevated and remained high until the end of the study period (p < 0.001). Our results indicate an altered regulation of the HPA axis in the postoperative period of patients after CABG surgery, as they are compatible with similar results in patients after major abdominal surgery, burned patients, and critically ill patients. Therefore, it is assumed that the finding of a postoperative dissociation between ACTH and cortisol is a result of the severity of perioperative adaptive mechanisms rather than of the specific conditions related to cardiac surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Successful non-devitalizing treatment of localized pulpal lesions in mature teeth is not ensured using conventional endodontic techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate CO2 laser surgical treatment of pulpal exposures in canine patients. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17 permanent teeth with pulpal exposures of < or = 48 h duration received localized laser pulp surgery. Laser Parameters: pulse duration: 0.01 s, pulse interval: 1.0 s, spot size: 0.004 cm2, fluence: 276 J/cm2. Exposures were dressed with CaOH and Glass ionomer. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed by one blinded clinician 24 and 52 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: 15/17 laser-treated teeth assessed over > or = 1 year post-treatment remained clinically and radiographically healthy. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the CO2 laser for localized pulp surgery. Further studies must optimize laser parameters and identify the range of clinical pathologies which can be treated using this modality.

TI  - A prospective and consecutive study of surgically treated lumbar spinal stenosis. Part II: Five-year follow-up by an independent observer.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective and consecutive study of surgical results obtained during serial follow-up investigations in patients who underwent surgery for central lumbar spinal stenosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the result after surgical decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis, at regular intervals after surgery, and to correlate these results with values for preoperative parameters; special interest was focused on the results in relation to the degree of constriction of the spinal canal. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The outcome after surgery for spinal stenosis is debatable; long-term follow-up investigations have indicated deterioration with passing time. Results of studies in nonsurgical patients have demonstrated that the symptoms do not progress with time. Results of a meta-analysis of the literature on surgical results have demonstrated a wide variation of outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 105 consecutive patients who underwent surgical decompression (laminectomy with facet-preserving technique, but no fusion) were evaluated at follow-up examinations 4 months and 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. At the follow-up examinations, the patient's opinion on the surgical result was registered, using a four-grade scale. The occurrence of pain at rest and at night was registered, as well as the patient's walking ability. Statistical analysis was performed, relating the surgical results to patient age, gender, preoperative duration of symptoms and radiographically observed constriction as described in Part I of this study. The radiologist was blinded to patient outcome. Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 19 patients underwent reoperation, consisting of fusion to treat lumbar pain (n = 4), repeat decompression because of progressive stenosis (n = 13), and repairs in response to surgical complications (n = 2). Follow-up results: The result, related to the recurrence of leg symptoms, deteriorated with passing time. Excellent results were reported by 63% to 67% at 4-month and 2-year follow-ups compared with 52% at the 5-year follow-up. There was a correlation between the constriction of the spinal canal and the outcome at all intervals. Patients with an anteroposterior diameter of 6 mm or less at the narrowest site had significantly better results. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between a severe reduction of the anteroposterior diameter and excellent results and a tendency toward better results in patients with a shorter preoperative duration of symptoms. Improvement of walking ability was also associated with a pronounced constriction of the spinal canal. CONCLUSION: The results after surgical decompression in patients with central spinal stenosis deteriorated with time. There was a significant correlation between good result and pronounced constriction of the spinal canal. Patients with a preoperative duration of symptoms of less than 4 years and patients with no preoperative back pain tended to have better surgical outcomes. The reoperation rate was 18% within 5 years.  When surgery for spinal stenosis is contemplated, these prognostic factors should be taken into consideration: The "ideal patient" has a pronounced constriction of the spinal canal, insignificant lower back pain, no concomitant disease affecting walking ability, and a symptom duration of less than 4 years.

TI  - Reinvestigation of water diuresis in the rat: role of anesthesia and acute surgery.  
AB  - Renal effects of water loading on urine flow rate (V) and concentration (Uosm) were studied in Wistar rats subjected to minor or extensive surgery, under different kinds and level of anesthesia. In the explanted kidney of chronically prepared rats, under light chloralose anesthesia, 1 h.i.v. hypotonic fluid load increased V of the experimental (left) kidney 11 fold while Uosm decreased from 1181 +/- 142 to 210 +/- 80 mosm kg/H2O. In the acutely exposed kidney, under Inactin anesthesia, V increased 5 fold and Uosm decreased from 785 +/- 170 to 204 +/- 57 mosm/kg H2O. In similar experiments under Nembutal anesthesia V increased 4 fold but the urine did not become hypotonic. After acute surgery under Inactin anesthesia water diuresis can be induced but urine concentration before water loading is impaired. Urine hypotonicity after water loading is not achieved in acute experiments under Nembutal--an unsuitable approach to studies of water diuresis. Thus, a transition from antidiuresis to urine dilution can best be accomplished in the chronic explanted kidney model under light anesthesia and without invasive surgery.

TI  - MR imaging based strategies in limb salvage surgery for osteosarcoma of the distal femur.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse to what extent MR imaging based decisions were correct in determining the surgical procedure in patients with osteosarcoma of the distal femur. DESIGN: We compared the findings on MR imaging that determined the surgical strategy with the actual surgical findings or histopathological specimen. We assessed to what extent MR images could be used to determine the surgical procedure in patients with osteosarcoma. PATIENTS: Between 1985 and 1992, 34 patients with an osteosarcoma were treated. Two patients had a low-grade osteosarcoma. Thirty-two patients with a high-grade osteosarcoma of the distal femur (17 stage IIB, 15 stage III) were included in this study. Surgical options consisted of either limb salvage surgery or ablative surgery, which included the Van Nes-Borggreve rotationplasty. Limb salvage surgery consisted of extra-articular or transarticular resection, followed by reconstruction. Surgery was planned depending on the local extent of the tumour as depicted on the MR studies, coupled with data from the biopsy, age, patient compliance and histological grade. Follow-up was available in all patients. Nine of 17 patients graded as IIB were alive with an average follow-up of 68 months (range 46-109 months), of whom one has metastases. No local recurrence was encountered. RESULTS: If no tumour involvement on MR imaging was found and this was used as a determining factor, this proved to be correct at subsequent analysis. We found that in eight of 11 cases, when MR images suggested a close relationship between tumour and nerve, an oncologically safe plane could be achieved during surgery. In three, a free plane could not be accomplished, as confirmed at histopathological examination. Hence, when nerve involvement was equivocal on MR imaging we found it valuable to reassess nerve involvement during surgery and reconsider limb salvage surgery. When the decisive factor was the vascular involvement and tumour extension was read as equivocal, it was possible to obtain a oncologically safe plane in six of 13 cases. When comprehensive tumour involvement of any structure was noted pre-operatively, it proved to be correct at histopathological examination, except for one case of assumed vascular involvement that proved to be free. CONCLUSIONS: If no tumour involvement of a structure was found on MR imaging and this was used as a determining factor, this proved to be correct. When nerve involvement was equivocal on MR imaging we found it valuable to reassess nerve involvement during surgery and reconsider limb salvage surgery. Extensive tumour involvement of any structure, as shown by MR imaging, could be used correctly as a decisive argument in planning a surgical procedure.

TI  - Relation of factor V Leiden genotype to risk for acute deep venous thrombosis after joint replacement surgery.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: A point mutation in coagulation factor V (A1691G) is associated with increased risk for venous thrombosis. However, limited information is available about the prospective risk for deep venous thrombosis in specific high-risk clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the factor V Leiden mutation is associated with an increased occurrence of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of plasma samples obtained during six prospective clinical trials that compared different antithrombotic prophylaxis regimens in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. SETTING: Inpatients at the University of Rochester Medical Center, McMaster University Medical Center, Hamilton Civic Hospitals, and the Genesee Hospital. PATIENTS: 825 patients hospitalized for hip or knee replacement surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Venographically diagnosed postoperative deep venous thrombosis was correlated with factor V genotype. RESULTS: The factor V Leiden mutation was not associated with a significantly increased risk for venographically detected deep venous thrombosis. The absolute incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 31% (95% CI, 15% to 47%) in patients with the mutation and 26% (CI, 22% to 29%) in patients without the mutation (relative risk, 1.2 [CI, 0.6 to 2.9]). The factor V Leiden mutation was not significantly associated with deep venous thrombosis in subgroups of patients receiving warfarin or heparin. The incidence of clinical hemorrhage was similar in patients with (10%) and without (8%) the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The factor V Leiden mutation is not a significant risk factor for acute deep venous thrombosis in this group of patients. Current data do not justify routine preoperative screening for this mutation or intensified perioperative prophylaxis in patients with the factor V Leiden mutation who are undergoing hip or knee joint replacement surgery and are receiving effective antithrombotic prophylaxis.

TI  - Severe metallosis caused by shaving down of the stem neck due to outer cup impingement of a bipolar endoprosthesis. A case report. off  
AB  - The authors report on a patient with severe metallosis caused by shaving down of the stem neck due to outer cup impingement. A primary arthroplasty was performed using an Omnifit bipolar endoprosthesis (Stryker) with an acetabular bone graft fixed by ceramic screws. At the time of revision surgery the synovium was stained black. Two ceramic screws were broken, but no scratch was observed on the metal surfaces of the outer cup and the inner head. The ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) of the inner-bearing collar was worn and flat. During the operation, a groove was observed at the stem neck where the outer cup impinges. An analysis of the black pseudocapsule by scanning electron microscopy with electron prove microanalysis (SEMEPMA) revealed that the pseudocapsule contained titanium metal particles. To our knowledge, metallosis caused by the same mechanism has only been reported in four joints, which were replaced by a Zimmer BHP bipolar endoprosthesis and Howmedica bicentric cup.

TI  - Serum leptin and insulin concentrations in patients with insulinoma before and after surgery.  
AB  - Inferential studies suggest that circulating insulin concentrations positively regulate leptin secretion by adipocytes. In humans, however, insulin requires prolonged periods of time, and relatively artificial set-ups before a relationship with leptin can be observed. In the present work, serum leptin concentrations were measured in five patients with insulinoma before and one month after surgery and in five control subjects matched by sex and body mass index (BMI). The control subjects presented a mean serum leptin concentration of 6.7+/-1.5 microg/l and a BMI of 24.9+/-1.1. The mean serum leptin concentration in patients with insulinoma was 11.8+/-3.1 microg/l (P < 0.05 vs controls), with a BMI of 26.3+/-1.9. After surgery, there was a non-significant reduction in BMI (25.8+/-1.7), and a clear reduction in serum leptin concentration (5.6+/-2.4 microg/l, P < 0.05 vs pre surgical values and no difference vs control subjects). The fasting area under the curve (AUC) of insulin concentration (in mU/l per 120 min) before surgery was 14421+/-4981 and after surgery was 1306-/+171 (P < 0.05). Before surgery, serum leptin concentrations significantly correlated with BMI (r = 0.71) and AUC of insulin (r = 0.82), a correlation that was lost after surgery. In conclusion, serum leptin concentrations are significantly elevated in patients with chronically high insulin levels due to insulinoma. After surgical treatment and normalization of insulin values, leptin levels return to normal.

TI  - Usefulness of the substitution of nonangiographic end points (death, acute myocardial infarction, coronary bypass and/or repeat angioplasty) for follow-up coronary angiography in evaluating the success of coronary angioplasty in patients with angina pectoris.  
AB  - Historically, restenosis after coronary angioplasty has been assessed angiographically at about 6 months. The desirability of avoiding routine follow-up angiography as well as the recognition that angiographic and clinical assessments are not necessarily the same has prompted greater interest in following patients clinically after angioplasty. Clinical restenosis has been defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, or additional angioplasty within 6 months of the index procedure. Clinical restenosis was observed in 2,340 of 11,473 patients (20.4%). The mortality at 6 months was only 1%. Although there were somewhat more acute myocardial infarctions and coronary surgical procedures, the most frequent event was additional angioplasty. Angiographic restenosis was noted in 30% of patients without clinical restenosis and in 87% of patients with clinical restenosis (p < 0.0001). Patients with clinical restenosis were less likely to be women, had more systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, more severe angina originally, fewer prior myocardial infarctions, more multivessel and left anterior descending artery disease, more multisite procedures, more branch site procedures, and longer and tighter stenoses both before and after the procedure. The year of the procedure did not correlate with restenosis. Clinical restenosis is less common than angiographic restenosis and the most common event is additional angioplasty. Although clinical restenosis is rarely fatal, it does result in inconvenience and additional resource consumption.

TI  - Cataract patients in a defined Swedish population 1986-1990. VIII. Postoperative astigmatism, intraocular pressure and visual acuity.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Cataract surgery is often followed by a certain amount of astigmatism that changes in the postoperative period. However, there are large variations in both size and changes of the postoperative astigmatism. I have analysed the variations and the influence of different explanatory variables on the postoperative astigmatism. METHODS: Data for all patients undergoing cataract surgery from 1986 up to and including 1990 in the Lund Health Care District were prospectively recorded. Except for cases operated on with both keratoplasty and cataract, all cases were included in the study. The different explanatory variables considered included sex, age, preoperative axial length, preoperative average keratometry, preoperative intraocular pressure, glaucoma history, diabetes history, uveitis history (including both anterior and posterior uveitis), and a history of rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: Besides age and sex, several variables significantly influenced the development of size and/or change in the postoperative astigmatism. They were preoperative astigmatism (polar value), preoperative intraocular pressure, and whether or not the cataract patient had an insulin dependent diabetes. Phacoemulsification as extraction mode, the location of the incision, complications at surgery, and whether or not a sphincterotomy was performed also influenced the two parameters of astigmatism. It was also important whether or not the operation was performed by a high volume surgeon. CONCLUSION: In this material, the most important predisposing factors for rapid changes in the postoperative astigmatism were large preoperative astigmatism (polar value), young age, low preoperative intraocular pressure, if an ECCE were chosen as the extraction type, and the surgeon. The same variables and, in addition, if the location of the incision was anterior to the limbus were the most important explanatory variables in generating an early, large with-the-rule astigmatism.

TI  - Effects of surgery on mucosal pathologic changes following experimental sinusitis in rabbit.  
AB  - In the present investigation, the regenerative capacity of the infected maxillary sinus mucosa following surgical procedures was studied in a rabbit model. Sinusitis was induced by occluding the ostium with and without the addition of Staphylococcus aureus or Bacteroides fragilis, or by provoking a prolonged bacterial infection with both pathogens. The surgical procedures performed were 1) widening of the natural sinus ostium (middle meatal antrostomy; MMA) and 2) removal of sinus mucosa without ostial interference (modified radical operation; MRO). The histologic features of the entire nose-sinus complex were studied, graded semiquantitatively, and compared with findings in untreated sinusitis, or after surgery only. Whereas MMA and MRO both led to a decrease of the inflammatory features of the sinus mucosa in induced sinusitis, persistent local histopathology was observed in the ostial region following MMA surgery. This indicates the importance of local pathologic changes resulting from interactions of bacterial colonization, inflammation, and surgery in chronic sinusitis.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of spine surgery among a membership of American orthopaedic surgeons with a particular interest in spine care [North American Spine Society (NASS)] and a general membership of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons [Canadian Orthopaedic Association (COA)]. A 25-item multiple choice questionnaire was developed and mailed to both memberships. The COA response rate was 45.9%; the NASS response rate was 45.8%. Of those who replied, 17.2% had undergone spinal surgery, and the results differed significantly between the COA at 12.9% and NASS at 21.9%. As a percentage of the total mailing, 7.7% had undergone spinal surgery. These results differed significantly between the COA at 5.9% and NASS at 9.7%. Although the surgery rate for NASS respondents was more than 1.5 times that of COA respondents, they had strikingly similar outcomes. They are a highly motivated, self-employed group who missed little work before and after having surgery.

TI  - Dressing the part.  
AB  - Wound care after cutaneous surgery can play an integral role in wound healing. Wound care regimens have changed dramatically over the last 35 years as the physiology of wound healing has become better understood. Foremost is the improvement in wound healing achieved by keeping the wound occluded and moist. This observation has led to an explosion of a whole new category of occlusive dressings at the surgeon's disposal in healing postoperative wounds. These dressings have numerous applications as discussed previously. Generally, for acute surgical wounds, occlusive dressings are most useful for split-thickness wounds, such as graft donor sites and after dermabrasion, chemical peel, or laser treatment, and full-thickness wounds allowed to heal by secondary intention. Occlusive dressings may have greater benefit for the treatment of chronic ulcers of varying etiologies. The different categories of dressings share the common disadvantage of being relatively expensive. For routine sutured wounds, the authors prefer the readily available and inexpensive Telfa-type dressing combined with a topical antibiotic ointment. Topical antiseptics are useful for reducing bacterial counts on intact skin in preparation for surgery. Povidone-iodine (Betadine) and chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibiclens) have emerged as the two agents of choice. However, antiseptics have been shown to be toxic to healing tissue, and should not be used on open wounds. In contrast, topical antibiotic ointments are safe to use on open wounds, effective in preventing wound infections, and promote wound healing by maintaining a moist wound environment. The authors prefer the combination antibiotic ointment Polysporin for routine postoperative wound care. Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery to prevent wound infection is appropriate in certain cases. Surgery performed on grossly contaminated or infected skin requires a full 7 to 10 day course of antibiotics. Procedures in anatomic areas considered contaminated as well as in clean areas with significant environmental or patient risk factors may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. The choice of antibiotics should be based on the organism most likely to cause wound infection at the particular surgical site. Evidence supports giving a single preoperative dose 1 hour before surgery with a second dose possible 6 hours later if the procedure is prolonged or delayed. The risk of bacterial endocarditis after dermatologic surgery is not known. Antibiotics are indicated for any procedure on obviously infected skin, but are not routinely required for very minor procedures, such as small biopsies, on intact skin. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be prudent for those patients classified as high risk by the (AHA). The antibiotic chosen should again cover the organism most likely to cause infection. One dose can be given 1 hour before surgery and repeated 6 hours postoperatively. Finally, wound healing can be greatly impacted by what the patient does or does not do after leaving the office. Therefore, wound care instructions should be clear, detailed, and provided in both oral and written form. Information should also be provided about what to expect as the wound heals.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis in surgery [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: With tighter constraints on health care spending, many recognize the need to identify and restrict clinical interventions that are not cost-effective. As a result, cost-effectiveness analysis is being used increasingly to assess the relative value of surgical interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We first present the general concept of cost-effectiveness analysis and review a recent study of carotid endarterectomy to demonstrate the technique. We next consider the classic application of cost-effectiveness analysis to resource-allocation decisions and use the Oregon Medicaid experiment to illustrate some potential problems with this approach. We then present the current role of cost-effectiveness analysis: informing decisions about individual interventions that are new, controversial, or in direct competition with an accepted alternative treatment. Finally, we review several limitations of the methods used to measure costs and benefits and discuss problems with the interpretation of cost-effectiveness studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis is a systematic approach to assessing the relative value of health care interventions. This technique is being used increasingly to frame clinical policy decisions in surgery. Because of this, surgeons need to understand cost-effectiveness analysis and be prepared to examine these studies critically.

TI  - Pituitary-adrenal, hormonal changes during induced hypotension with labetol or isoflurane for middle-ear surgery.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pituitary-adrenal secretion during induced hypotension for middle-ear surgery has received little attention. Previous work failed to differentiate the effects of induced hypotension from surgical stimulation. We have undertaken a preliminary study examining the effects of hypotension, achieved with labetalol or isoflurane, on pituitary-adrenal secretion before, during and after middle-ear surgery. METHODS: Twenty-four patients were allocated randomly to 3 groups. The control group were anaesthetised with isoflurane, and normotension maintained for 30 min before hypotension was induced with isoflurane and surgery started. In the labetalol group, this drug was given i.v. to obtain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mm Hg for 30 min before surgery and hypotension maintained with labetalol during the operation. In the isoflurane group, hypotension was induced to a MAP of 60 mm Hg for 30 min before surgery and continued throughout the procedure. All 3 groups received metoprolol i.v. before hypotension was established. Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia, during anaesthesia alone (normotensive or hypotensive), surgery with hypotension, and recovery. They were analysed for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), cortisol and aldosterone. RESULTS: Induced hypotension before surgery failed to stimulate release of ACTH, AVP and cortisol. No significant increase in these hormones occurred until the postoperative period. Aldosterone concentrations increased significantly during anaesthesia and hypotension in the labetalol and isoflurane groups (P<0.05) and continued to rise significantly in all 3 groups during surgery. However, there was no significant difference in aldosterone concentration before surgery between the control and the 2 hypotensive groups. CONCLUSION: ACTH, AVP and cortisol secretion were not stimulated by induced hypotension to MAP of 60 mm Hg before surgery. Increased aldosterone secretion occurred and a further study with a larger sample size is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of distal urethral stenosis arising from fibrous periurethritis in women. METHODS: 9 patients who had undergone surgery for distal urethral stenosis caused by fibrous periurethritis are described. Patient history, clinical symptoms, the surgical technique employed, complications and post-operative course are presented. RESULTS: All 9 patients had a history of recurrent urinary infection and alteration of the urinary stream. The results obtained by surgery were satisfactory in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Distal urethral stenosis arising from fibrous periurethritis is uncommon, but not rare. Diagnosis is principally based on the clinical symptoms, characterized by low urinary obstructive symptoms, and the finding at physical examination of a narrow meatus and periurethral enlargement caused by fibrous tissue surrounding the distal urethra. The Richardson urethrolysis technique achieved satisfactory results in these patients.

TI  - Importance of intrapulmonary lymph nodes in the differential diagnosis of small pulmonary nodular shadows.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the importance of intrapulmonary lymph nodes (IPLNs) in the differential diagnosis of small pulmonary nodules and to review the CT findings of IPLNs. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patient records. SETTING: Chest Disease Research Institute Hospital, Kyoto University. PATIENTS: Between January 1991 and May 1996, we examined 26 patients with pulmonary nodular shadows smaller than 1 cm in diameter that could not be diagnosed before surgery. All patients (19 men, 7 women) underwent chest CT (28 to 72 years old; mean, 52.3 years). RESULTS: The pathologic diagnoses were IPLNs in 46.2% (12/26), pulmonary hamartoma in 23.1% (6/26), lung cancer in 11.5% (3/26), pulmonary tuberculoma in 11.5% (3/26), and metastatic lung tumor in 7.7% (2/26). IPLNs were located in the lower lobe in 72%. The characteristic CT findings of IPLNs were a clear border and location close to the pleura. Two of them resembled lung cancer. The CT features in these two IPLNs and in three small lung cancers overlapped. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we investigated small nodular shadows <1 cm in diameter and found that IPLNs located underneath the pleura are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of lung cancer. The CT scan findings of IPLNs were not necessarily specific and sometimes resembled those of lung cancer. Because of their location, video-assisted thoracic surgery is useful in making a definite diagnosis.

TI  - [Effect of external extra-articular ligament plasty on the results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon, a 4 years follow-up]  
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare the functional results obtained when an external extra-articular plasty was added to an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using an autologous bone tendon-bone patellar tendon graft. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors analyzed two consecutive series of 60 and 50 patients operated by the same surgeon for a chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament, one by reconstruction of the cruciate ligament with a free graft of the patellar tendon supplemented by an external extra-articular plasty made with a quadriceps tendon graft and the second with an isolated free patellar tendon graft. Anterior laxity was measured before and after surgery, by dynamic X-rays and by the Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer. Functional results were evaluated four years after operation, with the French A.R.P.E.GE score based on sport activity level and intensity. RESULTS: Anterior laxity was not different before operation in both groups and there was no difference between males and females. Medmetric KT-1000 arthrometer showed the same negative differential laxity immediately after surgery in both groups and the same evolution during the first 4 years, without any significant difference on laxity on the middle aspect of the knee. Radiological results were different. After a 4 years follow-up, anterior laxity did not show significant difference on the medial compartment of the knee (5.3 +/- 2.3 mm and 5.5 +/- 1.7 mm), but there was a significant minor laxity in the lateral compartment for the lateral extra-articular plasty group (11.0 +/- 2.3 mm against 14.8 +/- 3.8 mm)(p = 0.002). Functional results and sport activity were similar in both groups. Examination showed 4 positive pivot shift tests (2 "sliding" and 2 positive) in the group with extra-articular plasty, even though 8 positive pivot shift tests in the isolated ACL group (5 "sliding" and 3 positive) were found. DISCUSSION: This study, as well as five others studies found in literature, was not randomized. In all these series, the surgical techniques, the rehabilitation programs and the functional score evaluation were too different to allow any pertinent comparison. Extra-articular plasty helps to control the laxity of the lateral compartment of the knee which is incompletely controlled by ACL reconstruction, particularly in chronic cases. This is proved by radiological measurements and pivot shift tests. Jensen in 1983, about 205 patients with a 4 year follow-up and Noyes, which used an allograft patellar tendon, found an advantage to do extra-articular plasty. But Strum (in 1989), as O'Brien (in 1991) and Roth (in 1987), did not found any advantage with extra-articular plasty. CONCLUSION: It is therefore obvious, after a four-year follow-up, that extra-articular supplementation presents an advantage for reconstruction of the ACL. by a free graft of the patellar tendon in chronic cases. Further randomized study will confirm that isolated ACL reconstruction is possible in some well defined categories of anterior laxity.

TI  - Evaluating results of laparoscopic surgery for esophageal achalasia.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extramucosal myotomy of the lower esophagus and cardia, combined with anterior fundoplication, is, in our opinion, the procedure of choice to treat stage I-III esophageal achalasia. METHODS: After a successful experience with open surgery in over 280 patients, from January 1992 through February 1997, 61 patients underwent laparoscopic Heller-Dor for stage I-III achalasia. Conversion to laparotomy was done in three cases. All procedures were performed under intraoperative endoscopic control. Intraoperative complications were seven mucosal tears, which were sutured laparoscopically in five cases. The sole postoperative complication was bleeding from an acute gastric ulcer (conservative treatment). RESULTS: Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiographic study 1 month after surgery, and endoscopy and manometry within 1 year. After a mean follow-up (F.U.) of 21 months (1-62), clinical results range from excellent to good in 98.2%. One patient (1.7%) complaining of recurrent dysphagia improved after endoscopic dilation. Esophageal diameter reduced from 52 to 27 mm. LES pressure reduced from 30.3 +/- 12.4 to 10.7 +/- 3.5 mmHg (basal) and from 14. 8 +/- 9.3 to 2.9 +/- 2.1 mmHg (residual). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation is feasible, safe, and effective. Special care should be taken in patients with previous endoscopic dilations.

TI  - [Change in intraocular pressure after intraocular lens implant during a follow-up period of over 10 years]  
AB  - Changes in intraocular pressure were studied in 141 eyes following intraocular lens implant. The average observational time was twelve years. We tried to fix both loops of the implant in the ciliary sulcus. The intraocular pressure increased over the ten year interval at 0.19 mmHg per year. Twenty-seven of the 141 eyes developed glaucoma. We studied the intraocular pressure of the cases with or without complications. Thirty-eight eyes had complications, fifteen eyes (39%) developed secondary glaucoma, and three eyes (8%) developed glaucomatous visual field defect. In twenty-three cases without secondary glaucoma, the intraocular pressure increased over a three-year interval after surgery and remained constant thereafter. 103 eyes had no complications to influence the intraocular pressure, twelve eyes (12%) developed secondary glaucoma, and four eyes (4%) developed glaucomatous visual field defect. In 91 cases without secondary glaucoma, the intraocular pressure increased over a five-year interval after surgery at 0.28 mmHg per year and remained constant thereafter. We recommend regular examination, especially during the initial five-year period when the intraocular pressure is apt to increase even if complications are not evident.

TI  - An 8-year experience of hepatic resection: indications and outcome.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most reports highlighting decreasing operative morbidity and mortality rates following hepatic resection have focused on the management of metastatic disease. Information on the full range of hepatic disease is lacking. METHODS: The indications for hepatic resection in a specialist hepatobiliary unit have been reviewed and the operative morbidity and mortality rates assessed. RESULTS: Among 129 patients undergoing 133 hepatic resections between October 1988 and September 1996, the principal indication for resection was hepatic malignancy (102 resections), metastatic in 66 cases. Other indications included contiguous tumour (n = 20), primary tumour (n = 16) and benign disease (n = 31). Some 116 procedures were classical anatomical resections. Blood transfusion was required in 40 per cent of cases but major morbidity occurred in 20 per cent. There were six deaths following surgery, five of which were due to hepatic failure and followed resection for malignancy or trauma. The 3-year survival rate in patients resected for colorectal metastases was 65 per cent. CONCLUSION: This experience has demonstrated an increasing role for hepatic resection in a wide variety of hepatobiliary pathologies. Despite the low postoperative mortality rate, the significant risk of complications in the postoperative period serves to emphasize the need for careful selection of patients for such surgery, which should be undertaken in specialist centres.

TI  - Relation between preoperative inspiratory lung resistance and the outcome of lung-volume-reduction surgery for emphysema.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery to reduce lung volume has recently been reintroduced to alleviate dyspnea and improve exercise tolerance in selected patients with emphysema. A reliable means of identifying patients who are likely to benefit from this surgery is needed. METHODS: We measured lung resistance during inspiration, static recoil pressure at total lung capacity, static lung compliance, expiratory flow rates, and lung volumes in 29 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease before lung-volume-reduction surgery. The changes in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) six months after surgery were related to the preoperatively determined physiologic measures. A response to surgery was defined as an increase in the FEV1 of at least 0.2 liter and of at least 12 percent above base-line values. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 23 had some improvement in FEV1 including 15 who met the criteria for a response to surgery. Among the variables considered, only preoperative lung resistance during inspiration predicted changes in expiratory flow rates after surgery. Inspiratory lung resistance correlated significantly and inversely with improvement in FEV1 after surgery (r=-0.63, P<0.001). A preoperative criterion of an inspiratory resistance of 10 cm of water per liter per second had a sensitivity of 88 percent (14 of 16 patients) and a specificity of 92 percent (12 of 13 patients) in identifying patients who were likely to have a response to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative lung resistance during inspiration appears to be a useful measure for selecting patients with emphysema for lung-volume-reduction surgery.

TI  - Achalasia: a prospective study comparing the results of dilatation and myotomy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: In a prospective and randomized clinical study, the operative method and dilatation in the initial stage of megaesophagus were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Forty patients in the initial stage of megaesophagus, managed by forced hydrostatic dilatation of the cardia (20 patients-DILAT Group) or by esophagocardiomyotomy associated with esophagofundopexy (20 patients-Group OP) were followed-up for three years, in terms of clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, manometric and pH monitoring. RESULTS: 1) Both procedures can be performed without significant morbidity or mortality. 2) The two procedures are similar regarding ongoing suppression of dysphagia. 3) Radiologically, the methods are equivalent, since they promote significant elimination of contrast stasis and maintenance of the esophageal diameter. 4) Endoscopic follow-up did not differentiate the procedures in terms of the development of reflux esophagitis, with a rate of only 5% for each group of patients. 5) Manometry demonstrated that surgery produced a significantly greater reduction of the LESP as compared to dilatation, although the latter also determined a marked drop in the maximum basal pressure of the LES. 6) Neither procedure altered the length of the LES. 7) With prolonged esophageal pH monitoring, dilatation demonstrated a greater propensity for reflux as compared to surgery. CONCLUSION: Both methods offer benefits in the treatment of the initial stage of megaesophagus, although esophageal pH monitoring indicates that dilatation provokes a greater index of esophageal acid exposition time.

TI  - Laser in situ keratomileusis for myopia and myopic astigmatism.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the precision and safety of myopia and astigmatism correction using laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). SETTING: Augenchirurgie und Laserzentrum Hoch-Rum (Sanatorium der Kreuzsch-western), Innsbruck, Austria. METHODS: In this prospective study, LASIK was performed on 66 eyes of 39 patients with myopia ranging from 1.50 to 16.00 diopters (D). Astigmatism, ranging from -0.00 to -3.00 D, was treated simultaneously.  Surgery was performed with the Chiron Keracor 117 excimer laser and the Chiron Automated Corneal Shaper microkeratome. During the 6 month follow-up, manifest refraction as well as best corrected and uncorrected visual acuities were measured; corneal topographies were produced and slitlamp biomicroscopy was performed. Changes in visual acuity and corneal topography were evaluated. RESULTS: After 6 months, mean myopia had decreased from 6.78 D +/- 3.48 (SD) to 0.40 +/- 0.98 D. Fifty-one of 63 eyes (81.0%) were within +/- 1.00 D of spherical emmetropia and 61 of 63 (96.8%) within +/- 1.00 D of cylindrical emmetropia. Uncorrected visual acuity improved in all eyes; it was 20/40 or better in 82.5% 6 months postoperatively. Best corrected visual acuity did not change in most eyes; 9.5% lost two or more Snellen lines. No central islands or corneal scars were detected postoperatively. Haze was noted in only 6 eyes (9.1%); it was transient and less than grade 1. No sight-threatening complications occurred intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: Laser in situ keratomileusis was an exact and predictable procedure for correcting low, moderate, and high myopia and myopic astigmatism.

TI  - Bacterial arthritis due to beta-hemolytic streptococci of serogroups A, B, C, F, and G. Analysis of 23 cases and a review of the literature.  
AB  - The clinical features, essential laboratory findings, management, and outcome of all 23 cases of septic arthritis caused by different serogroups of beta-hemolytic streptococcus (BHS) seen at the Stanford Medical Center, Stanford, CA, from July 1, 1985, through October 31, 1996, were reviewed and compared to those found in the literature. Group A streptococci (GAS) accounted for 9 (40%) of our cases; group B (GBS), for 7 (30%); and Group G (GGS), for 7 (30%). No cases were caused by Group C (GCS) or F (GFS) during this period. During the same period, GAS accounted for 66 (33%) of 200 cases of bacteremia due to BHS, GBS, for 98 (49%); GCS, for 12 (6%); GFS, for 4 (2%); and GGS, for 20 (10%). A review of potential risk factors revealed that, with the exception of GGS, male and female patients were almost equally distributed among each of the serogroups. Patients aged 50 years and older comprised 56%-77% of each group. Associated conditions and risk factors were present among most patients (19/23, 83%); autoimmune diseases and a chronic skin wound or trauma were notably present among patients with GAS, while diabetes mellitus and malignancy were more common among patients with GBS. Infected prosthetic implants were present in 7 patients, including 4/7 patients with GGS. All patients had positive cultures of synovial fluid, and 11/23 (49%) had positive blood cultures (GAS, 5/9; GBS, 6/7; and GGS, 0/7). The clinical presentation and hospital course of patients infected with the different serogroups varied. Patients infected with GAS had the most severe disease and those with GGS the least severe. Necrotizing fascitis, shock, DIC, and admission to the intensive care unit were found only among patients infected with GAS. Despite aggressive management with antimicrobial therapy and surgery, 4/23 patients died (3 patients with GAS; 1 with GBS). The isolates from our patients were not available for study; investigations by others of the biology of BHS suggest that the production of 1 or more of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins by isolates of GAS may account for the differences in the severity of disease among our patients with septic arthritis caused by different serogroups of BHS. Although septic arthritis due to BHS is uncommon, such patients provide a valuable model to study features of the host-parasite interaction that may contribute to the observed differences in severity of disease.

TI  - Clinical outcome and bowel function following total abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis in the Oriental population.  
AB  - Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is a commonly performed surgical procedure. The postoperative outcome of these patients, however, has not been studied in detail in the Asian population. AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the functional outcome of patients following total abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. METHOD: All patients subjected to a total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis during a six-year period from February 1989 to October 1995 were reviewed. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (male:female, 40:26) with a mean age of 55.2 (range, 20-88) years underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Median follow-up after surgery was 26 (range, 4-78) months. Indications for surgery were synchronous or metachronous tumors (18), complicated pancolonic diverticular disease (15), obstructed tumors with impending perforation (13), familial adenomatous polyposis (7), slow-transit constipation (6), and others (7). Mean operative time was 137 +/- 48 minutes. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 13.3 +/- 11.9 days. Time to first bowel movement and commencement of solid diet were 4.7 +/- 1.8 and 7.2 +/- 2.4 days, respectively. Four patients had prolonged postoperative ileus. Average stool frequencies per day were 5.5 at one week, 4.3 at one month, 3.9 at six months, 3.2 at one year, and 2.9 at two years postoperatively. Thirty-three patients (50 percent) required antidiarrheal treatment for a transient period, but none required long-term therapy. Ninety-seven percent of all patients rated the functional outcome as good to excellent, and 3 percent said it was fair. There was two perioperative mortalities. Five cases required re-laparotomy, three for anastomotic complications and two for hemoperitoneum. Five patients had recurrent admissions for adhesion colic, which resolved with nonsurgical therapy. Ten patients succumbed on follow-up, six to tumor recurrence, two to unrelated cancers (stomach and bladder), and three to medical conditions. CONCLUSION: The functional outcome of ileorectal anastomosis is generally rated as good to excellent by patients. Acceptable bowel function and control is regained within six months of the operation and levels off at one year after surgery, and no patient requires long-term antidiarrheal medication.

TI  - Pediatric spinal deformity.  
AB  - Pediatric spinal deformity is a common problem facing the pediatrician and orthopedic surgeon. Most commonly seen is idiopathic scoliosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Although the etiology of idiopathic scoliosis remains unclear, there continues to be a search for genetic markers and studies for the modes of inheritance. Idiopathic scoliosis is more clearly understood recently and is recognized as a complex three-dimensional deformity. Prognostic indicators for juvenile scoliosis have been identified. Surgical management of idiopathic scoliosis continues to evolve, and now a thoracoscopic endoscopic technique is available. Long-term follow-up has demonstrated generally satisfactory results with spinal fusion surgery. Other syndromes such as Klippel-Feil, familial dysautonomia, and Marfan syndrome demonstrate high rates of scoliotic deformities. Most are unresponsive to bracing and most often require surgical intervention. Although primary spinal neoplasms are uncommon, most are benign, and outcomes are generally satisfactory.

TI  - Camptodactyly: a unifying theory and approach to surgical treatment.  
AB  - Camptodactyly is an isolated congenital flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Surgical experience with 16 patients (18 fingers) between June 1983 and December 1994 is reported. Skin, fascia (retinaculum cutis), tendon sheaths, flexor digitorum superficialis tendon, lumbricals and interossei (particularly the lateral bands), joint surfaces, neck of the proximal phalanx, and central slip insertion were involved in all cases, although the degree of involvement can vary. Surgery must address all of these structures. Postoperative splinting is important. Fifteen patients had good or excellent results after surgery, with a mean gain in motion of 57 degrees (range, 0 degrees-90 degrees).  Surgery should be aimed at prevention of progressive deterioration and is probably not indicated in minor degrees of the deformity. Surgery should be reserved for patients with a preoperative PIP joint contracture of more than 60 degrees.

TI  - [Value and limitations of transrectal ultrasonography and computer tomography in preoperative staging of prostate carcinoma]  
AB  - A careful evaluation of local tumoral extension is mandatory in patient selected for radical surgery for prostate cancer. Nevertheless, prostatic imaging, achieved with transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and CT scan, is often unable to stage accurately the disease. The Authors report a retrospective analysis of 43 patients treated with radical retropublic prostatectomy: their findings support the idea that both TRUS and CT scan are unable to define the extent of the tumor, reaching respectively accuracies of 38 and 46%. From these data they conclude that CT can be excluded from the preoperatory workup of prostate cancer, except in selected patients, at high risk of nodal metastasis on the basis of PSA. TRUS is the mainstay of prostate cancer diagnosis and staging because it guides transrectal biopsies, but any conclusion made exclusively on the base of its imaging seems not reliable.

TI  - Concomitant endometrial hyperplasia in patients with endometrial carcinoma.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the histopathologic features and prognosis of patients with endometrial carcinoma with and without concomitant hyperplasia. METHODS: Histologic slides of the surgical specimens of 214 consecutive patients who underwent surgery as primary treatment for endometrial carcinoma from 1985 through 1991 were reviewed. RESULTS: Ninety-two of the 214 patients (43%) with endometrial carcinoma had concomitant endometrial hyperplasia. Patients with endometrial carcinoma with hyperplasia were significantly younger than those without hyperplasia (mean age 62 +/- 10 vs 65 +/- 9 years, P < 0.05). Carcinomas associated with hyperplasia were better differentiated and of lower surgical stage. By univariate analysis the frequency of recurrence was significantly lower (4% vs 17%, P < 0.004) and the estimated 5-year survival rate significantly higher (96% vs 85%, P < 0.01) in patients with endometrial carcinoma with concomitant hyperplasia. However, in multivariate analysis the presence of endometrial hyperplasia was not an independent prognostic factor and the 5-year survival rates of patients with or without hyperplasia did not differ significantly in any surgical stage. CONCLUSION: The presence or absence of concomitant endometrial hyperplasia is strongly correlated with the surgical stage of endometrial carcinoma.

TI  - Surgical site after resection of a meningioma.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to characterize MR changes over time at the site of meningioma resection in order to determine optimal timing for detecting residual and recurrent tumor. METHODS: Twenty-one patients were studied with enhanced MR imaging during the first 5 postoperative days and additional studies were obtained 3 to 8 weeks after surgery (16 studies), 3 months to 1 year after surgery (17 studies), and 1 year or more after surgery (32 studies). Images were analyzed for residual tumor, membrane enhancement, parenchymal enhancement, edema, and blood collections. RESULTS: Early postoperative images showed extensive, thin membrane enhancement that thickened by 3 to 8 weeks after surgery and that thinned or resolved and became less extensive by 6 months or more postoperatively. Twelve of 20 patients with long-term follow-up studies had membrane enhancement. Thin, serpiginous foci of enhancement in the surgical bed were identified only on early postoperative studies and probably represent gradual thrombosis of feeding vessels. CONCLUSION: Residual foci of meningioma are best detected on studies obtained within the first 5 days after surgery because membrane thickness increases by 3 to 8 weeks after surgery and may obscure a small residual meningioma. Our study confirms the presence of prolonged membrane enhancement after surgery, although it thins with time and becomes confined to the craniotomy site.

TI  - Hallux valgus in young patients: comparison of soft-tissue realignment and metatarsal osteotomy.  
AB  - Two procedures of hallux valgus correction in young patients were compared by long-term results: soft-tissue realignment (McBride) and Mitchell osteotomy. From 1970 to 1990, 33 hallux valgus deformities of 17 patients were corrected with one of these procedures at the Orthopaedic Department of the University of Mainz. Patients' age at operation ranged from 9 to 20 years and average follow-up was 16 years later. Reevaluation consisted of subjective criteria, such as pain, shoe-fitting, functional disability and cosmetics and objective parameters (hallux-valgus and intermetatarsal angle, osteoarthrotic changes and range of motion of the metatarsophalangeal joint). They were assessed by report, interview, radiograph and physical examination and determined the overall outcome. McBride procedure showed 59% good, 12% satisfying and 29% dissatisfying long-term results, whereas outcome after Mitchell osteotomy was graded as good in 69%, satisfying in 12% and dissatisfying in 19% of the cases. Critical analysis emerged, that each procedure has its own bounds of indication. Successful hallux valgus correction can be achieved by an individual approach consisting of careful study of the indications, well-performed surgery and appropriate postoperative care.

TI  - [Evaluation of the capacity of work using upper limbs after radical latero-cervical surgery]  
AB  - Evaluation of arm work capacity after radical neck surgery. The aim of this paper is to describe an approach for the assessment of work capacity in patients who underwent radical neck surgery, including those treated with radiation therapy. Nine male patients, who underwent radical neck surgery 2 months before being referred to our Unit, participated in the study. In addition to manual muscle strength test, we performed the following functional evaluations: 0-100 Constant scale for shoulder function; maximal shoulder strength in adduction/abduction and intrarotation/extrarotation; instrumental. We measured maximal isokinetic strength (10 repetitions) with a computerized dynamometer (Lido WorkSET) set at 100 degrees/sec. During the rehabilitation phase, the patients' mechanical parameters, the perception of effort, pain or discomfort, and the range of movement were monitored while performing daily/occupational task individually chosen on the simulator (Lido WorkSET) under isotonic conditions. On this basis, patients were encouraged to return to levels of daily physical activities compatible with the individual tolerable work load. The second evaluation at 2 month confirmed that the integrated rehabilitation protocol successfully increased patients' capacities and "trust" in their physical capacity. According to the literature, the use of isokinetic and isotonic exercise programs appears to decrease shoulder rehabilitation time. In our experience an excellent compliance has been noted. One of the advantages of the method proposed is to provide quantitative reports of the functional capacity and therefore to facilitate return-to-work of patients who underwent radical neck surgery.

TI  - Prognostic role of lymph-node level involvement in patients undergoing axillary dissection for breast cancer.  
AB  - AIMS: Clinical records of patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer were reviewed in order to evaluate the prognostic role of lymph-node level involvement. METHODS: From 1982 to 1991, 1143 patients had radical mastectomy or conservative surgery with total axillary dissection: 461 patients of mean age 57.1 years (range: 25-89 years) were lymph-node positive (pN1); 369 patients (80%) had radical mastectomy; and 92 patients (20%) had conservative treatment plus post-operative radiotherapy, with the same mean number (n = 16) of lymph nodes collected in the surgical specimen. Data were analysed for the number of positive lymph nodes and level of involvement. RESULTS: Level I, Levels I + II and Levels I + II + III were involved in 44.9, 18 and 21.4% of patients, respectively; 'skip metastases' occurred in 72 of 461 pN1 patients (15.5%). A univariate analysis showed that prognosis was directly related to the number of levels involved (P < 0.001), and skip metastases had the same prognostic role as Level I involvement. The numbers of involved lymph-node levels and metastatic lymph nodes were well correlated; multivariate analysis showed that involvement of Levels I and III was independently correlated with prognosis. After adjustment for age and number of positive lymph nodes, the number of involved lymph-node levels was an independent prognostic factor, with highest predictability when all three lymph-node levels were positive (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic value of lymph-node status should be defined not only by the number of metastatic lymph nodes, but also by the number of levels of involvement.

AB  -  The surgery of biliary ducts and malignant liver tumors is formulated illustratively in guidelines in order to assist the physician as well as the uninformed patient in their orientation concerning diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic questions. Special attention is paid to diagnostics, which is based on both rational and empirical verified arguments. Moreover, the examples presented in this study show that guidelines can only be formulated if extensive verified knowledge exists; for rare diseases and those about which little is yet known guidelines cannot (yet) be formulated.

TI  - The development and testing of the well-being index for surgical patients (WISP).  
AB  - The development and testing of the Well-being Index for Surgical Patients (WISP), an instrument designed to assess the well-being of patients between 1 and 4 months after abdominal surgery, is described. The measure was intended for use in a study of the effectiveness of a dietary supplement for patients undergoing such surgery. Interviews were conducted with 15 patients who had had abdominal operations between 1 and 4 months previously. They provided information about their well-being at the time of their interview and also during the period since they had been discharged from hospital. A draft questionnaire was derived from the interviews and field tested with a further 17 patients who found the content to be relevant and the questionnaire easy to complete. A further 44 patients completed the measure on three occasions; 1, 2 and 4 months after abdominal surgery. The instrument was shown to have good internal consistency and produced statistically significant improvements in well-being over time. A postal survey with 20 patients indicated that the instrument's test-retest reliability was adequate. The WISP is acceptable to patients and easy to administer, making it suitable for inclusion in clinical trials.

TI  - Retreatment of children after surgery for acquired esotropia: reoperation versus botulinum injection [see comments]  
AB  - AIMS: Two viable options were compared, reoperation and botulinum toxin injection, in the management of children who need retreatment after surgery for acquired esotropia. METHODS: 47 strabismic children previously operated to correct an acquired esotropia were randomised to reoperation or botulinum toxin injection. Reoperation was undertaken in 24 of these patients and botulinum toxin injection in 23 of them. The percentage net change in distance deviation, the percentage of patients with successful motor outcome, detectable fusion, and stereopsis were compared 1 year after retreatment and at last visit (average follow up: 2.9 years in reoperation group, and 2.7 years in botulinum group). The motor success rate relative to time elapsed from initial surgery was evaluated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the motor and sensory outcomes between patients reoperated and treated with botulinum injection. The frequency of correction to within 8 prism dioptres of orthotropia was, respectively: 75% versus 69.56% at 1 year; 70.83% versus 60.86% at last visit. Botulinum injection could be more effective when performed within 3 months of initial surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum injection is a rapid and safe procedure that may be as effective as reoperation in the management of children who need a secondary procedure after surgery for acquired esotropia.

TI  - Musculoskeletal surgery in psoriatic arthritis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the probability that patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) will require musculoskeletal surgery. To identify factors predictive of surgery in patients with PsA. To determine the clinical outcome of patients with PsA who underwent surgery compared to patients who did not. METHODS: The database of the Psoriatic Arthritis Clinic was searched to identify individuals who had undergone musculoskeletal surgery. Biological and clinical data such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor, clinical pattern, nail changes, functional class, number of inflamed joints, and radiological damage, as well as health scores such as Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS-2), SF-36, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were available for these patients. Patients who had surgery were compared to those who did not. RESULTS: Out of 444 patients with confirmed PsA, 31 had musculoskeletal surgery (6.98%). This probability increased with the duration of PsA. Surgery patients had their first operation at an average of 13.9 years (range 1-46) after onset of joint disease. Age at onset of PsA, clinical pattern, constancy of clinical pattern over time, rheumatoid factor, functional class, symmetry, nail changes, and the time separating the onset of skin disease and the onset of joint disease were not significantly different at the 0.05 confidence level. Patients who had surgery had significantly more radiological damage (p < 0.001) and more actively inflamed joints (p < 0.02) at first assessment than patients who did not. AIMS2, SF-36, and HAQ scores at final review were not statistically different across both groups. CONCLUSION: In our patients the probability of having musculoskeletal surgery for PsA was 7%. It increased with disease duration. Patients had their first surgery after an average of 13 years. The number of actively inflamed joints and the extent of radiological damage at first assessment were highly predictive of subsequent surgery: patients with the highest numbers of severely affected joints, both clinically and radiologically, were more likely to have surgery. "Baseline characteristics" such as ESR, rheumatoid factor, functional class, clinical pattern, nail changes, and symmetry were not predictive of subsequent orthopedic surgery.

TI  - [Pefloxacin versus ceftriaxone in single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in general clean-contaminated surgery. The Pefloxacin Study Group]  
AB  - Single-shot surgical prophylaxis is today used in all clean-contaminated surgery, because it is able to reduce the incidence of post-surgical infections. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Pefloxacin 800 mg i.v. slow infusion in single administration 1-2 hours before surgery versus ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. 1-2 hours before surgery in 297 patients suffering from clean-contaminated surgery, especially biliary surgery and gastrectomy. Efficacy of prophylaxis in 259 patients, evaluable according to the protocol, was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (urinary, respiratory and wound infections). In the Pefloxacin group (128 patients), no cases of wound infections were observed, except one case of wound sterile secretion, without dehiscence, (0.81%), one case of urinary infection (0.81%) and three cases of respiratory infections (2.34%). In the ceftriaxone group (131 patients), three cases of wound sterile secretion without dehiscence (2.36%), one case of urinary infections (0.76%) and four cases of respiratory infections (3.05%) were observed. From this study we can conclude that single-shot surgical prophylaxis with pefloxacin, drug with microbiological and pharmacokinetics characteristics suitable for prophylaxis, is able to prevent postsurgical nosocomial infections as well as ceftriaxone, considered a reference drug largely used in this indication.

TI  - Resolving extra- and intracranial signal changes during adult near infrared spectroscopy.  
AB  - Extracranial tissues have a significant effect on cerebral near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements in adults.  Carotid surgery provides the opportunity to determine the relative contributions from the intra- and extracranial vascular territories. To assist, a specifically gated Laser Doppler flowmetry probe can be inserted between the NIRS optodes to co-monitor cutaneous blood flow associated with external carotid artery (ECA) clamping, whilst transcranial Doppler can be employed to monitor relative changes in the intracranial blood flow seen during internal carotid artery (ICA) clamping. Established criteria for severe cerebral ischemia (SCI) following carotid cross clamping was applied to 703 consecutive patients undergoing carotid surgery for high grade stenosis. Ipsilateral frontal NIRS recorded the difference (Total-deltaHbdiff) in concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. Interrupted time series analysis following clamping of the ECA and ICA allowed the different vascular components of Total-deltaHbdiff (ECA-deltaHbdiff and ICA-deltaHbdiff) to be identified. Data from 76 patients was suitable. Sixteen (21%) patients fulfilled the criteria for SCI. Patients who demonstrated an ICA-deltaHbdiff of > 6.8 micromol l(-1) all showed SCI. No patient with an ICA-deltaHbdiff < 5.0 micromol l(-1) showed SCI. Thus an ICA-deltaHbdiff threshold of 6.8 micromol l(-1) provided a 100% specificity for SCI, whereas an ICA-deltaHbdiff < 5.0 micromol l(-1) was 100% sensitive for excluding SCI. When Total-deltaHbdiff was used without removing the ECA component, thresholds for SCI could not be resolved. NIRS can provide quantified thresholds for severe ischemia in the adult brain provided the extracranial component is removed.

TI  - Arthroscopic removal of palmar/plantar osteochondral fragments (POF) in the metacarpo- and metatarso-phalangeal joints of standardbred trotters--outcome and possible genetic background to POF.  
AB  - A clinical material of 133 Standardbred horses with palmar/plantar osteochondral fragments (POF) in the metacarpo- and metatarsophalangeal joints were studied. All horses had their fragments removed with arthroscopic surgery. 102 of the horses were 3 years old or younger when surgery was performed. Anatomical localisations of the fragments were in agreement with earlier reports. There was no statistical significant difference in month of birth in the POF--group compared to the total population. Eighty % of the horses that had raced before surgery came back to racing. The racing performance relative to their contemporaries remained the same after the POF operation. 65% of the horses that had not raced before surgery raced after the operation. The breeding index BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) was used to evaluate if the POF-horses differed genetically in racing ability from the total population. The average BLUP value of the POF group was 103.4 (+/- 0.65), while the mean BLUP value of the total population was 98.9. This difference was highly significant and indicated that these POF horses belonged to a selected group. A homogeneity test of allele frequencies in blood type systems was performed to evaluate if any genetic difference was persistent between POF horses compared to the total population. The statistical analysis of gene frequencies for alleles in blood type systems indicated a genetic discrimination in blood type systems D and Tf.

TI  - Significance of local recurrence of rectal cancer as a local or disseminated disease.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nature of 'local recurrence' of rectal cancer remains unclear. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer who underwent extended repeat resections including total pelvic exenteration (39) and sacrectomy (43) were reviewed. Twelve patients had distant metastases before or at the time of repeat resection. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 25 per cent. A second recurrence occurred in 45 patients including five of the eight 5-year survivors. Thirty-six of these recurrences had locoregional manifestations and 29 had distant metastases. Of 18 prognostic factors examined, the most significant determinant was the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time (CEADT), followed by the preoperative CEADT, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and occurrence of distant metastases, in decreasing order. Late onset of first recurrence was also a favourable indicator. Thus, the growth rate of the tumour had a more profound impact on survival than the current extent of tumour progression. After operation the CEADT was reduced in patients with second recurrence (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Locally recurrent rectal cancer is a manifestation of disseminated disease spreading locoregionally and often to distant organs with a low probability of long-term cure. However, survival varies widely depending on the tumour growth rate, which is biologically predetermined and is also influenced by surgery.

TI  - [A clinical analysis of 153 uterine sarcomas]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic factors and treatment methods of 153 uterine sarcomas. METHODS: 153 cases of the uterine sarcoma were eligible for this retrospective study. Of the 153 cases, 48 were leiomyosarcomas, 47 mixed mesodermal sarcomas, 37 endometrial stromal sarcomas, 8 carcinosarcomas, 4 sarcoma botryoides, 1 fibrosarcoma, and 8 malignant lymphomas. 81 cases were in stage I, 11 stage II, 33 stage III and 11 stage IV. 38 cases were treated by surgery alone, 24 by surgery combined with radiation therapy, 50 by surgery plus chemotherapy, 23 by surgery plus radiation therapy and chemotherapy, 4 by radiation therapy alone, 3 by chemotherapy alone, and 11 by radiation therapy plus chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate was 49.0%, and that of leiomyosarcomas, mixed mesodermal sarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas was 46.9%, 34.1% and 69.3% respectively (P < 0.01). The 5-year survival rate of lesions limited to the uterus (stage I + II), and that of pelvic cavity invasion (stage III) and distant metastases was 59.6%, 25.6% and 10.0% respectively (P < 0.01. When the uterus was smaller than a 3 months pregnant uterus, the 5-year survival rate was 49.9%. When the uterus size larger than a 3 months pregnant uterus, the survival rate was 18.8% (P < 0.05). Premenopausals surviving 5-year accounted for 56.3% and post-menopausal 28.9% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of uterine sarcoma is significantly associated with histologic type, clinical and surgico-pathological stage, uterine size and pre- or post-menopausal status. Radiation or chemotherapy alone is palliative. Postsurgical adjuvant radiotherapy significantly decreased vaginal and pelvic recurrences rates. A combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can reduce pelvic recurrence as well as enhance survivals.

TI  - Histopathologic and ultrastructural findings of surgically excised choroidal neovascularization. Submacular Surgery Trials Research Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the histologic and ultrastructural features of surgically excised choroidal neovascularization (CNV) from patients who had undergone submacular surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voluntarily submitted surgically excised CNV specimens from a subset of specimens obtained by the Submacular Surgery Trials Research Group between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1996, were available for this study. The specimens were routinely processed for transmission electron microscopic examination. The largest horizontal and vertical dimensions, cellular and extracellular constituents, and relationship of the CNV to the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-eight surgical specimens were obtained from 160 patients treated surgically in Submacular Surgery Trials centers. Sixty-one (78%) were from patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and 17 (22%) were from patients with ocular histoplasmosis syndrome or idiopathic causes (hereafter referred to as the non-ARMD group). The histologic diagnosis was fibrovascular tissue, fibrocellular tissue, or hemorrhage in all cases. Vascular endothelium and RPE were the most common constituents of the CNV. Basal laminar deposit was only present in CNV from patients with ARMD. Age-related macular degeneration specimens were larger (mean +/- SD, 2042 [+/- 1175] x 320 [+/- 185] microm vs 1498 [+/- 792] x 227 [+/- 166] microm) and were more likely to have a sub-RPE (beneath the RPE) component than non-ARMD specimens. CONCLUSIONS: All evaluated surgically excised CNV specimens in this study from patients enrolled in the Submacular Surgery Trials consisted of fibrovascular tissue, fibrocellular tissue, or hemorrhage. Surgically excised CNV associated with ARMD in this series was larger and often was located beneath the RPE compared with non-ARMD CNV, although fewer than half of all the specimens could be oriented by topographic relationship to the RPE.

TI  - [Intraoperative magnetic resonance tomography for control of extent of neurosurgical operations]  
AB  - PURPOSE: The main aim of our study was to find out whether the combined use of neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI can increase the rate of "complete tumor removal". The second aim was to characterize the different forms of surgically induced enhancement in order to differentiate them from residual tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgery was performed in 18 patients with high-grade glioma. Using a neuronavigation device, the surgeons operated up to the point where they would otherwise have terminated surgery. Intraoperative MRI was then performed to determine whether residual enhancing had been left behind and to update the neuronavigation device. If necessary, feasible surgery was continued. On days 1-3 after surgery early postoperative MRI (1.5 T) was performed. The proportion of patients in whom the enhancing tumor was completely removed was compared with a series of 60 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, who had been operated on using neither neuronavigation nor intraoperative MRI. We also looked for and characterized different types of surgically induced enhancement. RESULTS: Intraoperative MRI definitely showed residual tumor in 6 of the 18 patients and resulted in ambiguous findings in 3 patients. In 7 patients surgery was continued. Early postoperative MRI showed residual tumor in 3 patients and resulted in uncertain findings in 2 patients. The rate of patients in whom complete removal of enhancing tumor could be achieved was 50% at the time of the intraoperative MR examination and 72% at the time of the early postoperative MR control. The difference in proportion of patients with "complete tumor removal" between the groups who had been operated on using neuronavigation (NN) and intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) and those who had been operated on using only modern neurosurgical techniques except NN and ioMRI was statistically highly significant (Fisher exact test; P = 0.008). Four different types of surgically induced contrast enhancement were observed. These phenomena carry different confounding potentials with residual tumor. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience with intraoperative MRI in patients with enhancing intraaxial tumors is encouraging. Combined use of neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI was able to increase the proportion of patients in whom complete removal of the enhancing parts of the tumor was achieved. Surgically induced enhancement requires careful analysis of the intraoperative MRI in order not to confuse it with residual tumor.

TI  - Postoperative radiotherapy and surgery in stage I endometrial carcinoma: a 10-year experience.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from the literature show that the incidence of pelvic recurrences in poor prognosis endometrial carcinoma is significantly reduced by combined surgery and radiotherapy compared to surgery alone. METHODS: In this paper we analyze the results of the combined treatment surgery plus adjuvant Irradiation in patients with endometrial carcinoma with regard to survival, site of progression, and toxicity. The surgical treatment consisted of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Pelvic and para-aortic node dissection was performed. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival was 88%. Three patients had local failure. Ten patients with local control of disease had distant metastases and 2 had local and distant recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirms the data of the literature. Postoperative irradiation is a safe and well tolerated treatment which can achieve good local control in high-risk stage I endometrial carcinoma. The control of distant metastases remains an open issue.

TI  - Impact of surgery for stress incontinence on the social lives of women [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of collecting disease-specific and generic data on the impact of surgery on the social lives of women with stress incontinence; to describe the social impact of surgery in a representative group; and to determine the effect of timing on the assessment of outcome. DESIGN: Longitudinal study; questionnaires before and three, six, and twelve months after surgery. SETTING: Eighteen hospitals in North Thames region. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty-two women undergoing surgery for stress incontinence between January 1993 and June 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Post-operative recovery time, stress incontinence symptom impact index, activities of daily living, and cost of protection. RESULTS: Post-operative recovery was uneventful for most women, but three months after surgery 24% of those in paid employment beforehand were still on sick or unpaid leave. Most women (75%) reported that stress incontinence had less adverse impact on their lives three months after surgery, though 18% reported no change, and 7% felt life was worse. The likelihood of improvement was similar regardless of whether pre-operative urodynamic studies had been conducted. The extent of improvement was dependent on pre-operative severity. Similar findings were obtained six and twelve months after surgery. After an initial slight but nonsignificant deterioration in their ability to carry out activities of daily living, women gained a slight benefit from surgery (proportion with no or only slight limitation rose from 72% to 82%; P=0.0001). The mean cost of protection (pads and towels) fell from 8.59 pound sterling a month before surgery to 2.99 pound sterling a month one year after surgery, by which time 68% of women were not using protection. In contrast, 11% were still spending over 10 pound sterling a month. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to collect standard data on the impact of surgery on social functioning and, thus, provide women with better information on likely outcomes. The benefits of pre-operative urodynamic investigations need to be assessed. The stability of the outcome measures over the first post-operative year suggest that outcomes need to be assessed only once and at any time from three to twelve months after the operation.

TI  - Does volume of patients seen in an outpatient setting impact test scores?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methods of teaching surgery in the outpatient setting and means to measure the effectiveness of these methods have not been defined. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of number of outpatient encounters on test scores for third-year medical students. METHODS: Students rotating on the required third-year surgery clerkship between July 1994 and June 1996 kept a log of their activities including number of patients seen in clinic, number of cases scrubbed, and pages read. At the end of the rotation the students were given an essay examination and a multiple-choice examination. The data were analyzed looking for correlation between examination scores and volume of patients seen. United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were used as a baseline measure to compare the rotation groups. RESULTS: USMLE scores did not differ between groups. Mean essay examination scores varied significantly between some rotation groups, but did not follow a pattern. There was no correlation between the number of patients seen in clinic and essay examination scores. There was a significant correlation between essay score and USMLE Step 1 score (Pearson's r = 0.398) and between essay and multiple-choice examination scores (Pearson's r = 0.313). There was a significant negative correlation between number of patients seen in clinic and number of cases scrubbed (Pearson's r = -0.347). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in outpatient surgery clinics did not result in improved performance on written examinations in this surgery clerkship. To achieve the most benefit from the outpatient clinic, objectives of the experience need to be determined and appropriate tools used to measure their successful achievement.

PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety consecutive patients referred for Mohs surgery or other dermatologic surgery were randomized to receive anesthesia either with study compound or placebo. The 2 groups were equivalent with respect to age and sex distribution and the lesions treated were similar in character. No patients were withdrawn for adverse effects. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received local anesthesia before surgery with either buffered lidocaine hydrochloride or a solution consisting of nafcillin sodium in buffered lidocaine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All surgical wounds were evaluated in a blinded fashion at the time of suture removal (5-7 days) and scored according to a standardized assessment chart based on erythema, edema, and the presence of purulent discharge. RESULTS: Seven hundred ninety consecutive patients with 908 surgical wounds were enrolled in this study. A total of 12 wound infections were recorded. Eleven (2.5%) of these occurred in the control group, while only 1 (0.2%) occurred in the nafcillin group. This difference was highly significant (P = .003). Observers were blinded to patient groupings particularly for surgical wound scoring. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers strong supporting data for the use of a single intra-incisional dose of an antibiotic administered immediately before dermatologic surgery. The use of nafcillin and buffered lidocaine solution is inexpensive, safe, convenient, and effective.

TI  - Prognostic implication of histopathological, immunohistochemical and clinical features of oligodendrogliomas: a study of 89 cases.  
AB  - Histopathological, immunohistochemical and clinical parameters were correlated with survival in 89 cases of oligodendroglioma (65 patients with grade II and 24 patients with grade III of the WHO classification). Median survival time and 5-year survival rate were 3.5 years and 76% for patients with oligodendroglioma grade II and 0.875 years and 23% for patients with oligodendroglioma grade III. The tumor biopsy specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for Ki 67 (MIB-1), vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and synaptophysin. MIB-1 nuclear labeling index ranged from 0.0% to 33.4%; vimentin-immunoreactive tumor cells were found in 25 cases. MIB-1 nuclear labeling index and vimentin immunoreaction showed a significant statistical correlation to the 5-year survival rate of the patients. Tumors with vimentin expression (n=25) and/or high MIB-1 labeling index (n=26) had a poorer prognosis than tumors lacking vimentin expression (n=57) and/or displaying a low MIB-1 labeling index (n=56). The expression of immunoreactivity for GFAP (n=53), NSE (n=23) and synaptophysin (n=15) appeared to be of no prognostic relevance. Patients with gross total tumor resection (n=47) had a median survival time and 5-year survival rate of 3.3 years and 84% compared to 1.2 years and 42% for patients with subtotal resection (n=41). The comparison between patients who underwent surgery alone (n=53) and those who had surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy showed no significant survival benefit from postoperative radiation therapy. In conclusion, tumor grade, MIB-1 labeling index, expression of vimentin and the extent of surgery are shown to be of prognostic relevance for patients with oligodendroglioma.

TI  - Ulcer recurrence after gastric surgery: is Helicobacter pylori the culprit?  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori is the most important cause of recurrent peptic ulcer disease. However, its role in ulcer recurrence after peptic ulcer surgery is unclear. We aimed at studying the prevalence and distribution of H. pylori in patients who had undergone peptic ulcer surgery, and any association between H. pylori infection and ulcer recurrence in these patients. METHODS: Patients with previous vagotomy or partial gastrectomy presenting with dyspepsia or ulcer bleeding were recruited. Ulcer recurrence was documented by endoscopy. Biopsy specimens were taken from the gastric remnant and gastroenteric anastomosis in patients with previous partial gastrectomy, or from the antrum and corpus in vagotomized patients. H. pylori infection was detected by either a positive rapid urease test or the presence of the bacteria on histology. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were studied; 73 patients (78%) had partial gastrectomy and 20 (22%) had vagotomy with drainage. H. pylori infection was documented in 36 patients (49%) in the gastrectomy group and in 13 (65%) in the vagotomy group. Thirty-six patients in the gastrectomy group had recurrent ulcers and 15 (42%) of them had H. pylori infection. Twelve patients in the vagotomy group had recurrent ulcers and eight (67%) of them were H. pylori positive. The prevalence of H. pylori infection did not differ between patients with or without ulcer recurrence. CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection cannot account for ulcer recurrence after peptic ulcer surgery.

TI  - Cubital tunnel release with medial epicondylectomy factors influencing the outcome.  
AB  - From 347 cases of documented cubital tunnel syndrome, 160 required cubital tunnel release and medial epicondylectomy over a 10-year period and were considered for this retrospective study. These patients were monitored for 3 years after surgery. According to the modified scale of McGowan, 86% of patients were considered stage II. Eighty-one percent of the patients were symptom free, and 96% of the patients improved by 1 Wilson and Krout grade following surgery. We considered return of symptoms 3 months or longer after surgery as recurrence; there were 21 recurrences. There was no correlation between recurrence and limb dominance, patient age at the time of surgery, or length of preoperative conservative treatment. Of the patients with recurrences, 44% were in their fourth decade of life. The rate of recurrence in females (18%) was almost twice that in males (10%). The rate of recurrence was increased twofold when the patient did not return to work within 3 months. When concomitant ipsilateral carpal tunnel was present (44%), the recurrence rate was 17% compared with 9% in those without carpal tunnel syndrome. The recurrence rate was 20% when ipsilateral thoracic outlet syndrome was present compared with 9% in patients without other ipsilateral maladies. Therefore, higher recurrence rates should be anticipated in female patients, in patients with concomitant ipsilateral thoracic outlet syndrome and/or carpal tunnel syndrome, in patients in their third or fourth decade of life, or in patients not returning to work within 3 months after surgery.

TI  - Bladder neck strictures after radical retropubic prostatectomy: still an unsolved problem.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors responsible for anastomotic strictures of the bladder neck after radical retropubic prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 239 consecutive patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1987 and 1996, 36 (15%) developed anastomotic strictures after surgery. The influence of tumour stage, previous prostatic surgery, urinary extravasation and postoperative bacteriuria were assessed. RESULTS: In 21 patients (58%), the bladder neck stricture occurred within 3 months of surgery, in 11 (30%) at 4-12 months after surgery and in four (11%) more than 12 months after surgery; three of these also had local recurrence. Advanced tumour stage and positive margins did not correlate with a higher stricture rate, nor was there a significant difference in stricture rates with three or four anastomotic sutures. However, extravasation at the time of catheter removal (16 of 36 patients (44%) with vs 34 of 183 patients without (19%) stricture, bacteriuria of > 10(6) c.f.u./mL at the time of catheter removal (stricture group 21 of 36 patients (58%) stricture with vs 71 of 203 (35%) without) and previous prostatic surgery (TURP or open surgery, stricture in 28% of those previously operated vs 13% with no previous surgery) were significant risk factors. CONCLUSION: There are three risk factors for anastomotic stricture after radical prostatectomy: previous operations on the prostate, extravasation and asymptomatic bacteriuria.

TI  - [Multimodal therapy of tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract]  
AB  - Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapeutic principles have in recent years received increasing attention in the management of patients with carcinoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract. A series of randomized prospective trials has demonstrated that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy does not result in a convincing survival advantage after complete tumor resection in gastric or esophageal cancer. The available data on the role of neoadjuvant preoperative therapy in these patients as yet permit no conclusion. While neoadjuvant therapy may reduce the tumor mass in a substantial portion of patients, a series of randomized controlled trials has shown that, compared to primary resection, a multimodal approach does not result in a survival benefit in patients with loco-regional, i.e. potentially resectable, tumors. In contrast, in patients with locally advanced tumors, i.e. tumors for which complete removal with primary surgery appears unlikely, neoadjuvant therapy increases the chance for complete tumor resection on subsequent surgery. However, only patients with objective histopathologic response to preoperative therapy appear to benefit from this approach. Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio-chemotherapy increases the rate of response, particularly in squamous cell esophageal cancer, but may also increase postoperative morbidity and mortality. Neoadjuvant therapy should therefore currently only be performed in experienced centers within the context of prospective clinical trials. The identification of factors that would allow prediction of response to neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy is the focus of ongoing studies.

TI  - Postoperative induction of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 proteolytic activity: relation to insulin and insulin sensitivity.  
AB  - Increased serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) proteolytic activity (IGFBP-3-PA) has been demonstrated in a number of clinical states of insulin resistance, including severe illness, after surgery, and in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the present study we assessed the role of insulin sensitivity in expression of IGFBP-3-PA in serum. In 18 patients studied, a significant increase in IGFBP-3-PA (P < 0.005) was demonstrated after colo-rectal surgery. Eight patients receiving an oral glucose load before surgery demonstrated a significant greater relative increase in IGFBP-3-PA compared with 10 patients not receiving glucose (32.9 +/- 7.1% vs. 8.6 +/- 6.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). Both groups had reduced insulin sensitivity after surgery (-58 +/- 4%; P < 0.0001; n = 18), as determined by hyperinsulinemic, normoglycemic clamps; however, the group not receiving glucose displayed 18% less insulin sensitivity than the oral glucose load group (P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the relative changes in IGFBP-3-PA and C peptide levels were inversely correlated (P < 0.05), suggesting that increased IGFBP-3-PA, presumably increasing IGF bioavailability, may be associated with decreased insulin demands. Interestingly, insulin infusion during the 4-h hyperinsulinemic, normoglycemic clamp performed 24 h after surgery (post-op) resulted in a further increase in IGFBP-3-PA in both groups (P < 0.005), whereas no significant responses could be demonstrated during the pre-op clamp. The expression of increased IGFBP-3-PA was accompanied by conversion of endogenous intact 39/42-kDa IGFBP-3 into its 30-kDa fragmented form as determined by Western immunoblotting, and this conversion was virtually complete after the 4-h post-op clamp in patients displaying marked increases in IGFBP-3-PA. Characterization of the IGFBP-3-PA demonstrated that it was specific for IGFBP-3, as no degradation of IGFBP-1 and -2 was detected, and the use of various protease inhibitors demonstrated that serine proteases and possibly matrix metalloproteinases contribute to the increased IGFBP-3-PA level after surgery. We propose that IGF bioavailability may be increased by the induction of IGFBP-3-PA in insulin-resistant subjects, and that insulin regulates IGFBP-3-PA in this state.

TI  - [Glutamine and growth hormone for the surgical nutritional support]  
AB  - Characteristic responses to surgery, trauma, and sepsis are catabolism and immunodepression. Nutritional therapy is important for managing patients with severe surgical stress. Conventional nutritional support, however, has not been successful in reducing morbidity and mortality rates. New nutritional support strategies have been aimed at enhancing protein metabolism and immunity. This review focuses on glutamine and growth hormone as nutritional support strategies for patients experiencing surgical stress. Glutamine is important in several key metabolic processes in critical illness. Exogenous glutamine also augments the functions of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Growth hormone has potent anabolic actions. Moreover, the peptides have immunostimulatory effects. These new modalities may be beneficial for the treatment of surgical patients.

TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of matrix proteolytic enzymes in the periprosthetic tissue in the patients with loosening prostheses.  
AB  - Regional periprosthetic bone resorption plays an important role of prosthesis loosening. In order to study the possible mechanisms of loosening, we investigated the presence of matrix proteolytic enzymes in the periprosthetic tissue by immunohistochemical technique in 72 patients undergoing revision operation of loosened joint prosthesis, including 22 males and 50 females and aged from 19 to 88 years (mean, 61.7 years). Thirty-nine patients had a loosened hip prosthesis (18 males and 21 females) whereas 33 patients had a loosened knee prosthesis (4 males and 29 females). Tissue specimens collected during revision surgery underwent thin slide sections and H & E staining, and were observed under light microscopy and polarized-light microscopy. The results showed many macrophages, histiocytes, fibroblasts, as well as many phagocytosed metal debris and polyethylene debris in the periprosthetic tissues, suggesting an active bone resorption. Furthermore, we used immunohistochemical techniques to detect the distribution of matrix proteolytic enzymes in periprosthetic tissue, including lysosome enzymes (cathepsin B, cathepsin D and cathepsin G), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3). The immunostaining were classified as strong positivity, > 70% positive cells; moderate positivity, 20-70% positive cells; weak/negative, < 20% positive cells. The results showed that cathepsin B, cathepsin D and cathepsin G were found in most fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells, including multinuclear giant cells and epithelioid cells. MMPs were found in most fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells, as well as a scant amount in the extracellular matrix. These enzymes were also found in or around blood vessels, the endothelial cells in the richly vascularized tissue. All negative controls showed no staining. The results of immunoreactive staining ranged from 61.1% to 68.1% of strong to moderate positivity. Since these enzymes were related to the degradation of matrix protein, they may be related to the periprosthetic bone resorption. The further clinical significance needs further investigation.

TI  - Port-site metastases following laparoscopic surgery.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Application of laparoscopy to the resection of malignancy has been followed by a literature describing cases of metastatic involvement at laparoscopic port sites. These include patients who underwent surgery for early stage carcinoma and instances following laparoscopic procedures during which tumours were not dissected. METHODS: Recently published clinical and experimental studies, and case reports related to this problem are reviewed; their relevance is discussed. RESULTS: Experimental studies incorporating bench top and large animal models have confirmed that tumour cells may be redistributed to port sites during laparoscopic surgery either directly from contaminated instruments or indirectly via the insufflation gas. Small animal models suggest that the incidence of wound metastasis is increased following conventional laparoscopic surgery, and that it may be decreased by gasless laparoscopy or helium insufflation. This evidence suggests that the development of port-site metastases depends not only on the physical redistribution of tumour cells but also on the specific insufflation gas used, possibly because of influences on local metabolic or immune factors acting at the wound site. CONCLUSION: Further research in this area is urgent. Until the issue is better understood, patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for malignancy should be entered into clinical trials.

TI  - Changing estrogen and progesterone receptor patterns in breast carcinoma during the menstrual cycle and menopause.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status at the time of breast carcinoma surgery is used as a marker of both prognosis and hormone dependency to guide adjuvant therapy. The authors studied the influence of hormonal milieu at the time of surgery on ER and PgR levels. METHODS: A population of 2020 patients with breast carcinoma, including 575 premenopausal women, was analyzed. ER and PgR levels were determined by radioligand binding assays (cutoff values, 10 fmol/mg). Serum estradiol (E2), progesterone (Pg), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels obtained on the day of surgery were used to define the menstrual cycle phase in premenopause. RESULTS: In premenopause, there was a higher proportion of ER positive (ER+) tumors in the follicular phase (62%, n = 316) than in the ovulatory phase (51%, n = 59) and the luteal phase (53%, n = 200, P = 0.03). The mean ER level was also higher in the follicular phase (30 fmol/mg) than in the ovulatory phase (20 fmol/ mg) and the luteal phase (25 fmol/mg, P < 0.001). The percentage of PgR positive (PgR+) tumors tended to be higher in the ovulatory phase (85%) than in the follicular (78%) and luteal (72%) phases (P = 0.11). The mean PgR was also higher in the ovulatory phase (177 fmol/mg) than in the follicular and luteal phases (134 and 92 fmol/mg, respectively; P < 0.001). The percentage of ER+ tumors was higher among menopausal women than among premenopausal women (67% vs. 59%, respectively; P < 0.001). Conversely, the percentage of PgR+ tumors was lower among menopausal women than among premenopausal women (65% vs. 78%, respectively; P < 0.001). In premenopause, there was a weak negative correlation between ER and E2 levels. No correlations were found between levels of ER and Pg and levels of FSH and LH or among levels of PgR and E2, Pg, and FSH and LH in premenopausal and menopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ER and PgR levels in breast carcinoma during the menstrual cycle and menopause suggest that interpretations of hormone dependency on the basis of steroid receptor values should take into account hormonal status at the time of surgery.

TI  - Helical CT angiography in the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery stenosis.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the utility and accuracy of helical CT angiography (CTA) in the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis. METHODS: A comparison of CTA and conventional arteriogram was performed in 53 patients undergoing evaluation for carotid artery stenosis. Ninety-six carotid systems were evaluable. CTA stenosis was determined by the percent of area reduction seen on axial images through the level of greatest narrowing. MIP images were used to identify the point of maximal stenosis and to visualize overall vascular anatomy. The percent diameter stenosis was measured on conventional arteriograms using strict North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria. RESULTS: Significant correlation was found between CTA and arteriography (NASCET method R=0.87, ECST method R=0.87, p < 0.001). Using NASCET >60% as an indicator for disease, CTA had a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 90%, accuracy of 89%, negative predictive value of 88%, and positive predictive value of 89%. CTA identified plaque characteristics such as ulcerations (8), occlusion (10), fatty plaques (22), calcifications (48), and fibrosis (2). CTA underestimated 2 cases of short segment stenoses because of volume averaging, but this discrepancy was detected by duplex scan. No complications or renal dysfunction occurred with CTA; 1 patient became symptomatic during arteriography, necessitating termination of the procedure. CONCLUSION: CTA is a safe, non-invasive technique that precisely measures carotid artery area reduction and highly correlates to conventional arteriography. With this new technology, the current standards for carotid artery imaging may need to be reevaluated, and the precise role for helical CTA more clearly defined.

TI  - [Chemotherapy in a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of stage III non-small-cell bronchial cancers (NSCBC)]  
AB  - Radiotherapy and surgery are not the only treatments for non-small cell stage III bronchial cancer (CBNPC) but are elements in an overall strategy used in association with chemotherapy. In resectable forms, chemotherapy can be used only after the operation: 14 randomised trials have been published between 1962 and 1994 which were ultimately joined together in a large meta-analysis. Only chemotherapy containing platinum in the regime appeared to have a beneficial effect which was at the limit of statistical significance, although the effects of chemotherapy were deleterious for those regimes incorporating alkylating agents. The number of published trials associating chemotherapy and post-operative radiotherapy are much fewer. One finds, but in a less clear cut fashion, a deleterious effect of chemotherapy using alkylating agents and a tendency for a non-significant improvement and survival in the arms of studies containing Cisplatine in their regime. Chemotherapy may also be used before an operation and there are many theoretical arguments in favour of this approach. Three published randomised studies have important problems in their design and should be interpreted with caution whilst awaiting the results of several studies which are underway. In the non-resectable forms radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used in a sequential fashion, simultaneously or rapidly alternating each method of administration have advantages and disadvantages. At least ten randomised trials compare the sequence of chemotherapy-radiotherapy or radiotherapy-chemotherapy or radiotherapy exclusively. Each time chemotherapy comprising platinum was used the trials showed evidence of a significant difference in survival compared to the associated arms. Concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy using 5-Fluoro-uracil, VP16 and above all platinum have been the object of several Phase I and Phase II studies. Response levels with platinum. Several randomised studies have compared the association of chemotherapy/radiotherapy concomitantly to exclusive radiotherapy. Their results are divergent. Thus, if many questions remain, it seems established that the association of radiotherapy, in Stage III non-resectable cancer, or of short initial chemotherapy, or of concomitant therapy may be susceptible to improving the survival in a significantly way. Besides, it is probable but not yet demonstrate, that the association of short neoadjuvant chemotherapy to surgery in the resectable forms may equally improve the survival in a significant fashion.

TI  - The surgical treatment of spinal cord compression caused by tumorous metastases. A review of 91 cases.  
AB  - Spinal cord compressions as a result of metastases are of considerable importance with regard to the quality of life and life expectancy of the cancer patient. Although surgical treatment has contributed to a considerable improvement in the life conditions of these patients, some questions still exist, particularly with regard to the choice of the time to operate. Thus, a total of 91 patients submitted to decompression were studied, taking into consideration different factors such as anatomo-radiographic findings, temporal parameters regarding occurrence of compression, and relative neurologic findings. Compression was incomplete in 44% of cases, complete in 45%, and complete with vertebral collapse in only 11%. Furthermore, it was observed that the group with partial compression included the lowest percentage of patients who resumed walking (57.5%), as compared to those with complete block (65.85%), or complete block associated with vertebral collapse (70%). This contradiction is confirmed by the observation that the resumption of walking was longer in cases with total block as compared to those with partial block. These results, apparently paradoxical ones, may be explained on the basis of the different duration of compression in the two groups. In fact, if we analyze the data relative to the interval of time between the occurrence of neurologic symptoms and surgery, we observed that patients with partial block were those in which surgical indications were made a longer period of time after the onset of symptoms. Surgical indications must be made at the first sign of deficit, regardless of the degree of compression present in the radiologic documentation, in order to avoid the transformation of reversible functional medullary changes into irreversible structural lesions.

TI  - Outcome analysis of rhabdomyosarcoma of the lower urinary tract.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Multimodal therapy has resulted in a high cure rate for genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma. We propose that the strategy of induction chemotherapy followed by excision and reconstruction without radiotherapy may provide a high cure rate without the late sequelae of pelvic radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 13 patients with a mean age of 3.3 years diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary tract from 1986 to 1996. The primary site was the bladder in 4 cases and prostate in 9. After biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis patients were treated with chemotherapy and subsequent surgery, while radiotherapy was reserved for those with residual disease. RESULTS: After induction chemotherapy 8 patients underwent tumor excision via an organ sparing approach, which involved radical prostatectomy and partial cystectomy with or without bladder augmentation. In 5 patients the final pathological analysis showed positive margins. Repeat surgery in 6 patients included complete cystectomy and urinary diversion in 2 who had positive margins and recurrence after radiotherapy, urethrectomy and continent diversion for positive margins in 1, partial cystectomy and continent diversion in 1, and radical prostatectomy, partial cystectomy and continent diversion in 1 with stage IV disease who had local recurrence. In the latter case ileocystoplasty had been performed for a small noncompliant bladder. Six patients with microscopic residual or metastatic disease received radiotherapy. At a mean followup of 5.6 years 11 patients are disease-free. Continence was preserved in all reconstructed cases. Erections were reported in 8 patients, and renal function was maintained in 10. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that urinary tract reconstruction may be safely performed at primary excision surgery, radiotherapy induced morbidity may be minimized by limiting radiotherapy to residual and metastatic disease, frozen section results may be false-negative, potency may be achieved and radiological disappearance of the tumor should be confirmed histologically.

TI  - Effects of 0.5% and 0.25% apraclonidine on postoperative intraocular hypertension after cataract extraction.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a double-masked, prospective study to evaluate the effect of 0.5% and 0.25% apraclonidine on postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. METHODS: Fifty-four patients scheduled for ECCE were randomly divided into three groups of 18. The first group received one drop of 0.50% apraclonidine topically one hour before surgery and immediately after the end of the procedure. The second group received the same regimen but with 0.25% apraclonidine. The third group received artificial tears as the control group. IOP was measured 12 h preoperatively and 6 and 24 h postoperatively. All the measurements were made using the same Goldmann applanation tonometer by the same surgeon who did not know to which group the patient belonged. RESULTS: Preoperative mean IOP was 13.66 +/- 2.76 mmHg in the first group, 14.27 +/- 2.24 mmHg in the second and 14.5 +/- 1.34 mmHg in the control group. The differences were not significant (p = 0.398). Mean IOP at the early postoperative visit (6 h) was significantly lower in the first group (17.44 +/- 4.95 mmHg) than the second (21.78 +/- 7.19 mmHg) and the control group (24.55 +/- 5.65 mmHg) (p < 0.001). Mean postoperative IOP at 24 h was again significantly lower in the first group (14.33 +/- 3.75 mmHg) than the second (17.11 +/- 4.16 mmHg) and the control group (19.61 +/- 3.20 mmHg) (p, 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that topical 0.5% apraclonidine controlled early postoperative intraocular hypertension after cataract extraction without any side effects, while the 0.25% drops were not effective.

TI  - Outcome of gastric restriction procedures: weight, psychiatric diagnoses, and satisfaction.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight losses following bariatric surgery have varied widely, depending on length of follow-up and various pre-surgical characteristics of patients undergoing surgery. METHODS: One hundred thirty one patients had a detailed presurgical psychiatric evaluation. Patients were assessed clinically for 2 years after surgery and at follow-up a mean of 5.7 years after surgery. RESULTS: Mean presurgical body mass index (BMI) was 52.9 kg/m2; therefore, many patients had 'super obesity'. Two-thirds of the patients were located a mean of 5.7 years after surgery. The mean change in BMI at follow-up was 25% and the mean weight loss was 27%. One-third had excellent or good weight outcomes using the Griffen criteria. Five patients had died by follow-up. There was no relationship between age, gender, or fat content presurgically and weight loss at follow-up, although presurgical weight was associated with greater weight loss at follow-up. Weight regain began 2 years after surgery. There was no relationship between the presence or absence of a presurgical psychiatric diagnosis and weight loss at follow-up. There was also no relationship between the presence of a presurgical psychiatric diagnosis and various mental health parameters at follow-up. Satisfaction with the surgery was marginally associated with weight loss but significantly associated with improved mental and physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Mean weight losses were less than have been previously reported with gastric restriction procedures but the follow-up was longer than usually reported and many patients had 'super obesity' prior to surgery. The implications of 'super obesity' for weight loss are discussed.

TI  - A surgical option for familial chylomicronemia associated with insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of the present work is to present an effective surgical approach for the treatment of a medically-resistant form of hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Two siblings with familial lipoprotein-lipase deficiency and subsequent hyperchylomicronemia, widespread skin xanthomas and severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus came to our observation after several unsuccessful attempts at medical treatment. In order to lower plasma lipids through lipid malabsorption, a modified bilio-pancreatic diversion operation was employed. The rationale in deciding to use this surgical approach was based also on the likely hypothesis that diabetes, in these subjects, was secondary to high circulating and tissue levels of lipids. Insulin sensitivity in the two treated subjects, as well as in 24 healthy volunteers constituting the control group, was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect calorimetry, obtaining total end-clamp glucose uptake (M) and end-clamp glucose oxidation (ECGO) rates. RESULTS: Within 3 weeks of surgery, plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels had decreased from 4500 and 500 mg/dl (with dietary restrictions) to lower than 450 and 150 mg/dl (on a free, lipid-rich diet) respectively. Fasting plasma glucose levels had decreased from above 300 (under daily repeated subcutaneous injections of insulin) to 80-100 mg/dl (without administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents). Body weight and fat free mass were maintained in both subjects after surgery. In both patients, before surgery M and ECGO were significantly lower than in normal subjects, while after surgery they were not significantly different from normal subjects, confirming the positive metabolic effect of the operation. CONCLUSION: The surgical option used in these patients may represent an interesting and effective new possibility for treatment of those severe cases of hyperlipemia leading otherwise to metabolic complications and a low quality of life.

TI  - A new approach to surgery for Meniere's disease: talking about surgery [published erratum appears in Clin Otolaryngol 1999 Feb;24(1):81]  
AB  - Many patients experience a remission of their Meniere's disease between the time that surgery is agreed and their admission to hospital for the procedure. In a series of 23 consecutive patients where surgery appeared to be indicated for control of the vertigo of Meniere's disease, 12 settled within 6-8 weeks of agreeing that something would be done, and thereby avoided any surgical procedure. It is suggested that these patients may have been experiencing the same effect as provided by the conservative surgical procedures. In the absence of any clear evidence for a specific surgical effect from any conservative operation for Meniere's disease, the authors put forward the suggestion that abandoning all the conservative procedures in favour of the protocol of planned surgery should be considered; wait for 2 months and, if the incapacitating episodic dizziness continues, one should proceed to a differenting procedure.

TI  - Radical surgery for early gastric cancer.  
AB  - The role of radical surgery for early gastric cancer has become a topic of considerable debate. Despite excellent results from Japan and several retrospective and uncontrolled trials, results from two large prospective randomized trials appear to demonstrate no benefit from D2 compared to the D1 resections. These trials have prompted a move away from radical lymph-node dissection. We argue that this reasoning is flawed and based not on the lack of efficacy of the D2 resection but in an attempt to reduce post-operative mortality and morbidity. Post-operative complications are largely a result of distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy and the relative inexperience of surgeons performing the operations. By preserving these organs and concentrating surgery to specialized centres the complication rate of radical surgery can be significantly reduced to approximate that of non-radical surgery. Lymph-node metastasis to the N2 nodes in early gastric cancer has been shown to be as high as 23%.  Non-radical surgery poses significant risks of leaving residual disease. Radical surgery must remain the operation of choice if non-curative surgery for a curable condition is to be avoided.

TI  - Pubovaginal sling using cadaveric allograft fascia for the treatment of intrinsic sphincter deficiency [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Pubovaginal sling is the definitive management of female stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Customarily, autologous fascia has been used, although synthetic material has its proponents. Harvesting autologous fascia at surgery is associated with postoperative discomfort, and synthetic material has a history of infection and erosion. To assess whether allograft fascia is free from these drawbacks, we retrospectively compared the outcome of women undergoing pubovaginal sling using either autologous or cadaveric allograft fascia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our experience during the last 28 months with patients treated with the pubovaginal sling for intrinsic sphincter deficiency. All patients underwent preoperative video urodynamics. The outcome was assessed using the SEAPI scoring system. Special attention was devoted to local sling tolerance. Operative time and length of hospital stay were compared between patients with allograft and autograft pubovaginal sling. RESULTS: A total of 92 women (mean age 60 years) underwent allograft (59) or autograft (33) pubovaginal sling. Preoperative parameters, such as percent of patients who had had previous incontinence surgery, mean leak point pressure and SEAPI incontinence score, were similar in both populations. Mean followup was 11.5 months (range 1 to 28) for the overall population. The SEAPI scoring system showed that patients were markedly improved, with no significant difference between the allograft and autograft groups. Allograft and autograft pubovaginal slings were equally well tolerated, and no infection or erosion was encountered. Mean operative time and hospital stay were significantly shorter when using allograft compared to autograft fascia. CONCLUSIONS: The success rates of allograft and autograft pubovaginal sling were equally high, and no complications related to the cadaveric origin of the allograft fascia were observed. Allograft pubovaginal sling was well tolerated, and its use significantly shortened operative time and hospital stay.

TI  - Influence of intratumoral basic fibroblast growth factor concentration on survival in ovarian cancer patients.  
AB  - Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is considered as a potent mitogen that stimulates the growth of ovarian cancer cells, we evaluated the role of bFGF as a prognostic marker in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. bFGF was quantified from the tumor cytoplasm of 76 patients with FIGO stage I-III ovarian cancer by a human FGF basic immunoassay (R&D Systems). After a mean follow-up period of 42 months, 50 patients were found to be free of tumor while 26 patients had died of the disease. The median bFGF concentration was 352.9 pg/mg (range 27.4-26600 pg/mg). After dichotomization cytoplasmic expression of bFGF was found to be low in 44 tumors (< or =500 pg/mg) and high in 32 tumors (>500 pg/mg). The probability of overall survival was 38.8 and 58.5% in the low bFGF and high bFGF groups, respectively (log-rank P = 0.0066). In multivariate analysis, residual tumor after initial surgery and bFGF, but not histologic grade or stage of the disease, independently influenced the overall survival probability. Furthermore, tumors with high cytoplasmic expression of bFGF revealed a much greater stromal content. Therefore, we hypothesize that bFGF may induce a fibroblastic response which causes tumors with a high bFGF to be less aggressive than those with less stromal tissue.

TI  - [Does induction therapy followed by surgery improve the survival rate in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer patients?]  
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is distinguished from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid tumor doubling time, high growth fraction, and early development of widespread metastases. Surgery alone offers the best chance for long-term survival in selected patients with stage I SCLC. Most patients with limited SCLC (stage I-IIIa) are treated with "comprehensive therapy" combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy (thoracic radiotherapy and/or prophylactic cranial irradiation), and surgery. Although the efficacy of surgery in the control of local disease is well established, to date no report has shown better survival rates in patients who receive induction therapy when compared with patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy. However, studies of induction therapy include more patients with advanced-stage cancer than do studies of post-operative chemotherapy. Thus the final role of induction therapy followed by surgery must await the results of future prospective, randomized trials conducted by large cooperative study groups.

TI  - Emotional distress before coronary bypass grafting limits the benefits of surgery.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inclusion of large, heterogeneous groups of patients for coronary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery has resulted in a more mixed treatment outcome. Thus it becomes important to identify patients who are less likely to benefit from surgery or who may require additional support to improve treatment outcome. The aim of the present study was to examine whether psychological status measured before CABG can contribute to prediction of short- and long-term outcomes of the surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one consecutive patients from two large university hospitals in Stockholm completed a psychosocial questionnaire before being scheduled for surgery. One year after CABG, patients again completed the questionnaire. Follow-up of medical charts was conducted during the first 3 years after surgery. All major cardiac events (cardiac death, definite myocardial infarction, revascularization, and unstable angina verified by angiography or myocardial scintigraphy) were recorded. Although the overall effect of surgery was excellent in the majority of cases, the patients exhibiting a high degree of distress (anxiety, depression, and tiredness) before surgery assessed their status as being much worse both before the operation and at the 1-year follow-up. Equally important was the fact that patients considered distressed before surgery had significantly higher rates of cardiac events (16%) in the 3-year follow-up period compared with nondistressed patients (5%) (chi-square=5.11, degrees of freedom=1, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic evaluation and treatment of emotional distress in the candidates for coronary revascularization may be expected to result in more optimal subjective results and a reduction in the number of serious cardiac events after surgery.

TI  - Bunion correction using proximal chevron osteotomy: a single-incision technique.  
AB  - Proximal chevron first metatarsal osteotomy with lateral capsulotomy, adductor tenotomy, and binding of the first and second metatarsals was reviewed in 88 consecutive cases. Seventy-two cases in 55 patients are reported, with an average clinical follow-up of 41 months. The hallux valgus angle improved an average of 15 degrees , from 32.0 degrees preoperatively to an average of 17.0 degrees postoperatively. The intermetatarsal I-II angle improved an average of 5.5 degrees, from 15.3 degrees preoperatively to 9.0 degrees postoperatively. The lateral plantar first metatarsal angle did not change. First metatarsal length was decreased by 2.0 mm. Union occurred at an average of 2 months. Sesamoid position improved 49%, from a preoperative average subluxation of 80% to a postoperative average subluxation of 29%. Subjective foot score profiles improved from a preoperative average of 70.1/100 to a postoperative average of 94.4/100 with respect to pain, deformity, motion, disability, and cosmesis. There were 10 patients with complications, including three patients with delayed unions, two with second metatarsal stress fractures, one with hallux varus, two with hallux limitus, one with progressive arthritis, one with cellulitis, and one with hallux elevatus. Eighty-four percent of the patients stated that they would undergo the procedure again without reservation, 9% would proceed with reservation, and 7% would not proceed with surgery again if offered. This technique provides reliable successful long-term results for the treatment of moderate and severe symptomatic bunion, hallux valgus, and metatarsus primus varus.

TI  - Carcinoma of the male breast: a review and recommendations for management.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer is rare and experience of it in any single institution is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presentation, management and outcome of male patients with breast cancer treated at Concord Repatriation General Hospital hospital over a 38-year period and to determine a best-practice protocol based on the results and a review of the literature. METHODS: A total of 42 patients were retrospectively reviewed, pathology slides were re-examined and reclassified where necessary. Outcome was assessed and compared with results obtained from a literature review. RESULTS: A trend towards less radical surgery has emerged. Overall 5-year survival was 50%, but, due to the late age at presentation, more than half the deaths were non-breast cancer related. One quarter of the patients presented with locally advanced or metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation, diagnosis pathology and outcome of breast cancer are similar in men and women, although the disease occurs at a later age in men. Radical surgery is not required in order to gain local control, but knowledge of axillary node status is important in determining prognosis and the need for adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Early closure of a randomized trial: surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus radiotherapy in the management of intra-oral tumours [see comments]  
AB  - Tumours of the oral cavity/oropharynx occur relatively infrequently in the UK. The management of such lesions, especially the squamous cell carcinomas, is still a little controversial. Some centres advocate radiotherapy while others adopt surgery and radiotherapy. In an attempt to resolve the question of which approach gives the better results, a multicentre randomized trial was established to compare surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with radical radiotherapy alone. It was anticipated that 350 patients would be required to give a statistically significant result, but, after 35 patients had been entered, the trial was closed prematurely with a marked difference in overall survival in favour of the combination arm (P = 0.0006). At this analysis, carried out 23 months after trial closure, the survival difference between the two arms remains statistically significant for all causes of mortality (P = 0.001; relative death rate = 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.59).

TI  - [Dobutamine echocardiography for the preoperative evaluation of patients for surgery of the abdominal aorta]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the value of dobutamine echocardiography (DE) for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients scheduled for abdominal aortic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Preliminary prospective open study. PATIENTS: Thirty-three consecutive patients due to undergo effective abdominal aortic surgery, assessed by preoperative DE. METHODS: Previous myocardial infarction and atherosclerotic risk factors (RF) were noted. Incremental doses of dobutamine were administered in order to reach 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. The occurrence of regional wall motion abnormalities was considered as a positive test. In this case a coronary angiography was performed. RESULTS: Four patients had a history of angina pectoris. DE was not interpretable in five patients. Among the patients without symptoms, 12 had three RF or more, 12 had less than three RF. In eight patients with a positive test, coronary angiography showed one or more significant main coronary artery stenoses. All patients with angina pectoris had a positive test. None of patients without symptoms and less than three RF had a positive test, one third of patients with no symptomatology but with three RF or more had a positive test (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DE has the ability to identify patients with asymptomatic CAD. DE is recommended in patients with high probability of CAD, i.e. with three RF or more.
