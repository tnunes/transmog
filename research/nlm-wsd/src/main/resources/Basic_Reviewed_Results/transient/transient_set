TI  - Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) augments cytokine induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation and by bacterial infections in mice.  
AB  - We studied the effects of M-CSF on cytokine induction in vivo by LPS or by bacterial infection by comparing between the serum cytokine levels of mice administered with and without M-CSF. M-CSF at 250 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days significantly augmented serum IL-6 level induced by a subsequent injection of 25 micrograms/kg of LPS. The augmented IL-6-induction was dose-dependent from 50 to 1250 micrograms/kg/day of M-CSF, and required 2- to 3-doses of M-CSF at 250 micrograms/kg/day. Mice primed with M-CSF induced IL-6 in response to a 5-fold lower dose of LPS, and also produced higher levels of IL-1 alpha, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma than control mice. The priming effect of M-CSF was transient and reversible, and elicited independently of T-cells. An injection with intact bacteria, such as Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus also induced IL-6 in normal mice, and M-CSF administration augmented the induction of these cytokines. These results showed that M-CSF positively regulates LPS-dependent and -independent cytokine induction, suggesting a defensive effect against infectious agents through enhanced cytokine production.

Transcranial Doppler sonography performed during and after attacks of HaNDL showed asymmetrical decreases or increases in blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery, accompanied by increases or decreases in pulsatility suggesting fluctuations of arteriolar tone. The findings demonstrate focal vasomotor disturbances that link the transient headaches and deficits of HaNDL with attacks of migraine.

TI  - Menstrual bleeding in a female infant with congenital adrenal hyperplasia: altered maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.  
AB  - Vaginal bleeding during the neonatal period is commonly related to the withdrawal of maternal estrogens. Vaginal bleeding has also been reported in female infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and has been proposed to be due to a treatment-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. We report a female infant with the salt-losing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, who had the onset of vaginal bleeding at 3 months of life. Adrenal steroid suppression had been achieved by 2.5 weeks of age. At the time of bleeding, imaging studies revealed an enlarged right ovary with a dominant 3-cm cyst and additional small cysts that had not been seen on the newborn sonogram. The uterus was enlarged and stimulated. Three weeks later (1 week after the cessation of bleeding), repeat ultrasound demonstrated a marked decrease in the size of the right ovary, and the dominant cyst was no longer seen. The patient had a heightened FSH response to GnRH and elevated levels of estradiol for age. At 5 months of age, no further episodes of sustained vaginal bleeding were observed. Repeat hormonal levels were prepubertal, and pelvic sonogram demonstrated no evidence of stimulation. The findings in our patient suggest that a decline in adrenal androgens after glucocorticoid treatment resulted in an increase in gonadotropin levels, which then triggered a transient and augmented end-organ response (menses). Further, we suggest that our infant's hormonal findings may reflect a delay in the timely development of the negative restraint by sex steroids on gonadotropins that is normally observed in infancy.

TI  - Dorsal column but not lateral column transection prevents down-conditioning of H reflex in rats.  
AB  - Operant conditioning of the H reflex, the electrical analogue of the spinal stretch reflex, in freely moving rats is a relatively simple model for studying long-term supraspinal control over spinal cord function. Motivated by food reward, rats can gradually increase or decrease the soleus H reflex. This study is the first effort to determine which spinal cord pathways convey the descending influence from supraspinal structures that changes the H reflex. In anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, the entire dorsal column (DC), which includes the main corticospinal tract, or the right lateral column (LC) was transected by electrocautery. Animals recovered quickly and the minimal transient effects of transection on the right soleus H reflex disappeared within 16 days. Beginning at least 18 days after transection, 12 rats were exposed to the HRdown-conditioning mode, in which reward was given when the H reflex of the right soleus muscle was below a criterion value. In seven LC rats exposed to the HRdown mode, the H reflex fell to 71 +/- 8% (mean +/- SE) of its initial value. In six of the seven, conditioning was successful (i.e., decrease to < or = 80%). These results were comparable with those previously obtained from normal rats. In contrast, in five DC rats exposed to the HRdown mode, the H reflex at the end of exposure was 106 +/- 12% of its initial value. In none of these rats was HRdown-conditioning successful. DC rats differed significantly from normal and LC rats in both final H reflex values and number successful. In five DC and three LC rats that continued under control conditions over 30-78 days, the H reflex at the end of the period was 98 +/- 4% and 100 +/- 8%, respectively, of its initial value, indicating that DC or LC transection itself did not lead to gradual increase or decrease in the H reflex. The results indicate that the DC, containing the main corticospinal tract, is essential for HRdown-conditioning, whereas the ipsilateral LC, containing the main rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, and reticulospinal tracts, is not essential. Combined with the known muscular specificity of conditioning, these results suggest that the main corticospinal tract is essential for HRdown-conditioning. The DC ascending tract might also be necessary. The respective roles of the DC descending and ascending tracts, and transection effects on HRup-conditioning and on the maintenance of both HRup- and HRdown-conditioning after they have occurred, remain to be defined.

TI  - Survival chance in papillary thyroid cancer in Hungary: individual survival probability estimation using the Markov method [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: The typically benign, but occasionally rapidly fatal clinical course of papillary thyroid cancer has raised the need for individual survival probability estimation, to tailor the treatment strategy exclusively to a given patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 400 papillary thyroid cancer patients with a median follow-up time of 7.1 years to establish a clinical database for uni- and multivariate analysis of the prognostic factors related to survival (Kaplan-Meier product limit method and Cox regression). For a more precise prognosis estimation, the effect of the most important clinical events were then investigated on the basis of a Markov renewal model. The basic concept of this approach is that each patient has an individual disease course which (besides the initial clinical categories) is affected by special events, e.g. internal covariates (local/regional/distant relapses). On the supposition that these events and the cause-specific death are influenced by the same biological processes, the parameters of transient survival probability characterizing the speed of the course of the disease for each clinical event and their sequence were determined. The individual survival curves for each patient were calculated by using these parameters and the independent significant clinical variables selected from multivariate studies, summation of which resulted in a mean cause-specific survival function valid for the entire group. On the basis of this Markov model, prediction of the cause-specific survival probability is possible for extrastudy cases, if it is supposed that the clinical events occur within new patients in the same manner and with the similar probability as within the study population. RESULTS: The patient's age, a distant metastasis at presentation, the extent of the surgical intervention, the primary tumor size and extent (pT), the external irradiation dosage and the degree of TSH suppression proved to be statistically significant and independent prognostic factors with regard to cause-specific survival in multivariate studies. During follow-up, 14, 14, 9 and 12% of the patients underwent local/regional/distant relapses or thyroid cancer-related death, respectively. Through use of the above six independent clinical variables and the parameters relating to the four clinical events and their interrelations, mean cause-specific survival probabilities of 88, 83 and 78% were determined at 10, 20 and 30 years, respectively. The survival-predicting software (PATHYPRE) written on the basis of the biostatistical model is available through Internet connections on the home page of the National Institute of Oncology, Budapest (www.oncol.hu). CONCLUSION: Prediction of the individual survival probability for extrastudy cases affords a rationale for individualization of the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer patients.

TI  - [Transitory blindness after transurethral resection of the prostate]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of transient blindness post-TURP, a complication of the foregoing procedure. METHODS/RESULTS: The patient developed transient blindness following transurethral prostatic resection, ascribable to the resorption of the irrigation fluid (1.5% glycine), since this condition coincided with high serum glycine levels and its metabolites. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of glycine resorption during TURP is attributed to its metabolization to ammonia. Hyperammonemia encephalopathy causes inhibition of the brain neurotransmitters at different levels of the CNS, as well as in the retina. High intraocular concentrations of glycine affect the retinal amacrine cells, causing transient histological changes.

TI  - Kinetics of peptide-induced release of inflammatory mediators by the urinary bladder.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the release of inflammatory mediators by the urinary bladder in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory peptides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated guinea pig urinary bladder was incubated with 10 mumol/L each of substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), octreotide acetate (a long-acting analogue of somatostatin, SOM), or bradykinin (BK), and the release of histamine, prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was determined during 0-5, 5-30 and 30-120 min after addition. RESULTS: Substance P, NKA, VIP and BK stimulated the release of histamine, while CGRP and SOM suppressed the release to below the spontaneous rates. All peptides, except CGRP and SOM, stimulated the release of PGE2 between 0 and 30 min, and only VIP failed to stimulate the release of PGF2 alpha within 5 min of exposure. Substance P, NKA, VIP and BK stimulated the release of LTB4 and this required > 5 min of exposure. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the peptides evaluated induce an immediate and transient release of histamine and activation of cyclooxygenase and delayed activation of 5-lipoxygenase. These actions may directly regulate the participation of these peptides in the pathogenesis of cystitis.

TI  - Unexpected and differential effects of Cl- channel blockers on the Kv4.3 and Kv4.2 K+ channels. Implications for the study of the I(to2) current.  
AB  - The Kv4.3 K+ channel is thought to underlie the Ca(2+)-insensitive transient outward current (I(to1)) in ventricular myocytes of canine and human heart and to contribute to the I(to1) in rat myocytes. It has been suggested that there is a second component of the transient outward current in some species that is contributed by a Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current (known as I(to2)). The evidence for the existence of the I(to2) current is based, in part, on the pharmacological effects of various Cl- channel blockers. To test for possible interactions between these compounds and I(to1), the effect of several different Cl- channel blockers on the Kv4.3 channel was examined. The fenamates (niflumic and flufenamic acid) were found to have large effects on the position of the steady state inactivation curve of the Kv4.3 channel. The disulfonic stilbenes (DIDS and SITS) had markedly different effects and were found to greatly reduce the rate of recovery from inactivation of the Kv4.3 channel without large changes in the position of the activation and steady state inactivation curves. Both classes of drugs produced an apparent blockade of the Kv4.3 channel under some recording conditions. Surprisingly, the closely related Kv4.2 channel was found to be markedly less sensitive to these drugs. Caffeine was found to block both the Kv4.3 and Kv4.2 channels to a similar extent. These nonspecific drug effects have implications for the study of the two components of the transient outward current and suggest that purely pharmacological criteria cannot be used to define the physiological role of I(to2).

TI  - DNA methylation accounts for the inhibition of collagen VI expression in transformed fibroblasts.  
AB  - The expression of collagen VI, an adhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix, is completely inhibited in virally transformed fibroblasts and in many cell lines derived from spontaneous mesenchymal tumors. Here we present evidence that DNA methylation plays an important role in this inhibition: (a) The mRNA level for DNA methyltransferase is highly increased in simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed fibroblasts compared with normal cells and this increase correlates with the decrease of the mRNA level for collagen VI. (b) Methylation of the alpha2(VI) collagen promoter in vitro abolishes promoter activity in a transient transfection assay. (c) Genomic sequencing reveals extensive methylation of the promoter region in SV40-transformed cells, but virtually no methylation of the corresponding region in normal cells. Increased methylation is also observed in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. (d) Two of the cis-acting elements of the alpha2(VI) collagen promoter lose their affinity for transcription factor AP2 when methylated in vitro as demonstrated by gel retardation experiments. DNA methylation is therefore involved in the silencing of the alpha2(VI) collagen gene. It seems likely that the same mechanism is also responsible for the repression of other transformation-sensitive proteins.

TI  - Disinhibition of the superior colliculus restores orienting to visual stimuli in the hemianopic field of the cat.  
AB  - Following unilateral removal of all known visual cortical areas, a cat is rendered hemianopic in the contralateral visual field. Visual orientation can be restored to the blind hemifield by transection of the commissure of the superior colliculus or by destruction of the superior colliculus (SC) or the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) contralateral to the cortical lesion. It is hypothesized that a mechanism mediating recovery is disinhibition of the SC ipsilateral to the cortical lesion. The ipsilateral nigrotectal projection exerts a robust inhibitory tone onto cells in the SC. However, ibotenic acid destruction of SNpr neurons, which should decrease inhibition onto the SC, does not result in recovery. The failure of ipsilateral SNpr lesions to produce recovery puts into question the validity of SC disinhibition as a mechanism of recovery. We directly tested the disinhibition hypothesis by reversibly disinhibiting the SC ipsilateral to a visual cortical lesion with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A antagonist, bicuculline methiodide. In accordance with the hypothesis, transient disinhibition of the SC restored visual orienting for several hours in three of eight animals. Recovery was not a volume or pH effect and was distinct from the release of irrepressible motor effects (i.e., approach and avoidance behaviors) seen within the first hour after injection. Thus, in the absence of all visual cortical areas unilaterally, disinhibition of the SC can transiently restore the ability of the cat to orient to visual stimuli in the previously "blind" hemifield.

TI  - Retinal axon growth cone responses to different environmental cues are mediated by different second-messenger systems.  
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that the developing tip of a neurite, the growth cone, can respond to environmental cues with behaviors such as guidance or collapse. To assess whether a given cell type can use more than one second-messenger pathway for a single behavior, we compared the influence of two well-characterized guidance cues on growth cones of chick temporal retinal ganglion cells. The first cue was the repulsive activity derived from the posterior optic tectum (p-membranes), and the second was the collapse-inducing activity derived from oligodendrocytes known as NI35/NI250. p-Membranes caused permanent growth cone collapse with no recovery after several hours, while NI35 caused transient collapse followed by recovery after about 10 min. The p-membrane-induced collapse was found to be Ca2+ independent, as shown using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2 and by the persistence of collapse in Ca2+-free medium. Dantrolene, a blocker of the ryanodine receptor, had only a minor effect on the collapse frequency caused by p-membranes. In contrast, the NI35-induced collapse was clearly Ca2+ dependent. [Ca2+]i increased sevenfold preceding collapse, and both dantrolene and antibodies against NI35 significantly reduced both the Ca2+ increase and the collapse frequency. Thus, even in a single cell type, growth cone collapse induced by two different signals can be mediated by two different second-messenger systems.

TI  - Neurons sensitive to interaural temporal disparities in the medial part of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus.  
AB  - The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) is implicated in processing monaural sounds, because its neurons receive input chiefly from the contralateral cochlear nucleus. However, we demonstrate here that a region of the VNLL contains a distinct population of neurons that process binaural sounds and are sensitive to interaural temporal disparities (ITDs). Responses of single neurons were recorded from unanesthetized rabbits by using metal electrodes or micropipettes loaded with dextran tagged with either biotin or a fluorescent label. Reconstructions of recording sites based on a few marks indicated that ITD-sensitive neurons were located in a medial region of VNLL that has a low density of neurons or in the adjacent reticular formation. In one animal the locations of five ITD-sensitive neurons were marked directly by injection of dextrans with different tags. All of these neurons lay in the medial region of the VNLL. The ITD-sensitive neurons of the VNLL had characteristic responses. Most neurons responded only at the onset of contralaterally or binaurally presented tones; many did not respond to ipsilateral stimulation alone and did not follow dynamic changes in the ITD. The presence of ITD-sensitive neurons in the VNLL that responded only at the onset of tones suggests that this center plays a role in the localization of transient sounds.

TI  - Mechanism and kinetics of heterosynaptic depression at a cerebellar synapse.  
AB  - High levels of activity at a synapse can lead to spillover of neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. This extrasynaptic neurotransmitter can diffuse to neighboring synapses and modulate transmission via presynaptic receptors. We studied such modulation at the synapse between granule cells and Purkinje cells in rat cerebellar slices. Brief tetanic stimulation of granule cell parallel fibers activated inhibitory neurons, leading to a transient elevation of extracellular GABA, which in turn caused a short-lived heterosynaptic depression of the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell EPSC. Fluorometric calcium measurements revealed that this synaptic inhibition was associated with a decrease in presynaptic calcium influx. Heterosynaptic inhibition of synaptic currents and calcium influx was eliminated by antagonists of the GABAB receptor. The magnitude and time course of the depression of calcium influx were mimicked by the rapid release of an estimated 10 microM GABA using the technique of flash photolysis. We found that inhibition of presynaptic calcium influx peaked within 300 msec and decayed in <3 sec at 32 degrees C. These results indicate that presynaptic GABAB receptors can sense extrasynaptic GABA increases of several micromolar and that they rapidly regulate the release of neurotransmitter primarily by modulating voltage-gated calcium channels.

TI  - Changes in TcPCO2 regarding pulmonary mechanics due to pneumotachometer dead space in ventilated newborns.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of added dead space on PaCO2 after application of a pneumotachometer during the measurement of pulmonary mechanics. The study was based on 24 observations of TcPCO2 changes during the measurement of pulmonary function in 9 newborns subjected to mechanical ventilation. All newborns remained stable during the 23 minutes of the test. The introduction of a low dead space pneumotachometer (1.7 mL) for 10 minutes led to an increase in TcPCO2 of 5.40 +/- 2.66 mm Hg, from 39.76 +/- 8.69 to 45.17 +/- 9.22. Pulmonary mechanics indexes that correlated with the percentage of CO2 increase were peak inspiratory flow and expiratory time/time constant. When the pneumotachometer was removed, TcPCO2 fell but remained 0.99 +/- 2.13 mm Hg above basal TcPCO2. Final TcPCO2 tended to relate negatively with the minute volume. We conclude that this transient increase in PaCO2 should be born in mind in neonates with a high basal level and can be prevented by maintaining a long expiratory time and a high minute volume.

TI  - Interference of BAD (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter)-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells by 14-3-3 isoforms and P11.  
AB  - Apoptosis and survival of diverse cell types are under hormonal control, but intracellular mechanisms regulating cell death are unclear. The Bcl-2/Ced-9 family of proteins contains conserved Bcl-2 homology regions that mediate the formation of homo- or heterodimers important for enhancing or suppressing apoptosis. Unlike most other members of the Bcl-2 family, BAD (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 associated death promoter), a death enhancer, has no C-terminal transmembrane domain for targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane and nuclear envelope. We hypothesized that BAD, in addition to binding Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, may interact with proteins outside the Bcl-2 family. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to search for BAD-binding proteins in an ovarian fusion cDNA library, we identified multiple cDNA clones encoding different isoforms of 14-3-3, a group of evolutionally conserved proteins essential for signal transduction and cell cycle progression. Point mutation of BAD in one (S137A), but not the other (S113A), putative binding site found in diverse 14-3-3 interacting proteins abolished the interaction between BAD and 14-3-3 without affecting interactions between BAD and Bcl-2. Because the S137A BAD mutant presumably resembles an underphosphorylated form of BAD, we used this mutant to screen for additional BAD-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. P11, a nerve growth factor-induced neurite extension factor and member of the calcium-binding S-100 protein family, interacted strongly with the mutant BAD but less effectively with the wild type protein. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, transient expression of wild type BAD or its mutants increased apoptotic cell death, which was blocked by cotransfection with the baculovirus-derived cysteine protease inhibitor, P35. Cotransfection with 14-3-3 suppressed apoptosis induced by wild type or the S113A mutant BAD but not by the S137A mutant incapable of binding 14-3-3. Furthermore, cotransfection with P11 attenuated the proapoptotic effect of both wild type BAD and the S137A mutant. For both 14-3-3 and P11, direct binding to BAD was also demonstrated in vitro. These results suggest that both 14-3-3 and P11 may function as BAD-binding proteins to dampen its apoptotic activity. Because the 14-3-3 family of proteins could interact with key signaling proteins including Raf-1 kinase, protein kinase C, and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase, whereas P11 is an early response gene induced by the neuronal survival factor, nerve growth factor, the present findings suggest that BAD plays an important role in mediating communication between different signal transduction pathways regulated by hormonal signals and the apoptotic mechanism controlled by Bcl-2 family members.

The spatial sensitization branches of the amblyopic functions are considerably broadened as compared with those of the non-amblyopic function.

TI  - Calcium transient alternans in blood-perfused ischemic hearts: observations with fluorescent indicator fura red.  
AB  - Ischemia produces striking electrophysiological abnormalities in blood-perfused hearts that may be caused, in part, by effects of ischemia on intracellular calcium. To test this hypothesis, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients were recorded from the epicardial surface of blood- and saline-perfused rabbit hearts using the long-wavelength indicator Fura Red. Calcium transients were much larger than the movement artifact, representing up to 29% of the total signal. Switching the perfusate from saline to blood did not affect the time course of the transients or the apparent level of [Ca2+]i. Compartmentation of Fura Red fluorescence was estimated by exposure to Mn2+. The results were cytosol 60 +/- 3%, organelles 12 +/- 2%, and autofluorescence plus partly deesterified Fura Red 29 +/- 4%. [Ca2+]i transients were calibrated in situ by perfusion of the extracellular space with high-Ca2+ and Ca(2+)-free EGTA solutions. Peak systolic [Ca2+]i was 663 +/- 74 nM, and end-diastolic [Ca2+]i was 279 +/- 59 nm. Ischemia was produced by interruption of aortic perfusion for 2.5 min during pacing (150 beats/min). Ischemia produced broadening of the [Ca2+]i transient, along with beat-to-beat alternations in the peak systolic and end-diastolic level of [Ca2+]i (calcium transient alternans). [Ca2+]i transient alternans occurred in 82% of blood-perfused hearts vs. 43% of saline-perfused hearts. The discrepancy between large and small transients (mean alternans ratio) was larger in the blood-perfused hearts (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.03, P = 0.005). These observations are important because of the apparent relationship of [Ca2+]i transient alternans to electrical alternans and arrhythmias during ischemia.

TI  - 13C- and 15N-labeled peptide substrates as mechanistic probes of oligosaccharyltransferase.  
AB  - The carboxamide moiety that links the carbohydrate and protein moieties in N-linked glycoproteins has been unambiguously determined to arise intact from asparagine by the use of chemically synthesized Bz-[4-13C, 15N]Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2 as an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) substrate. Bz-[4-13C]Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2 was also synthesized and used to evaluate a proposed mechanism of OST catalysis similar to that of glutamine-dependent amidotransferases using 15NH4OAc as a potential external nucleophile. Analysis of NMR and MS spectra of the isotopically labeled peptides and the resulting biosynthesized glycopeptides indicates that free 15NH3 is not lost from the doubly labeled substrate during catalysis nor can exogenous 15NH3 intercept any of several postulated enzyme-bound species. These results indicate that OST-catalyzed glycosylation does not follow a mechanism involving the transient generation of exchangeable "NH3". Thus, in contrast to several glutamine-dependent amidotransferases, OST catalysis does not lead to transient scission of the asparagine beta-carboxamide C-N bond. Together with previously published results, these data argue against nucleophilic activation of the asparagine beta-carboxamide moiety being the underlying chemical mechanism for OST-catalyzed glycosylation of peptides.

TI  - Metabolic and hemodynamic effects of peptide leukotriene C4 and D4 in man.  
AB  - The time course of the effects of intravenous or intracoronary administration of peptide leukotrienes on metabolic parameters and on systemic and coronary hemodynamics was evaluated in 15 patients with normal coronary arteries. Peptide leukotriene C4 (2 nmol given as a bolus intravenous injection) induced an early fall (at 2 min) in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.02) associated with a rise in heart rate (P < 0.001) and in plasma levels of epinephrine (P < 0.05) and norepinephrine (P < 0.005), but without significant changes in coronary blood flow or coronary vascular resistance. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine, and epinephrine returned to baseline values 10 min after leukotriene C4 administration. In contrast, at 10 min post leukotriene C4, with coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption unchanged, an increase in coronary vascular resistance (P < 0.05) and in myocardial oxygen extraction (P < 0.01) was observed, which returned to baseline values at 20 min post leukotriene C4. Peptide leukotriene D4 (3 nmol, given in the left coronary artery) induced an early (20 s) and transient fall in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.001) paralleled by a rise in heart rate and plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, all of which returned to baseline at 10 min. Coronary vascular resistance increased at 10 and 15 min (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively) and myocardial oxygen extraction at 15 min (P < 0.02). These results suggest that small doses of peptide leukotrienes induce both an early and transient fall in mean arterial pressure associated with secondary sympathoadrenergic activation, and a late increase in small coronary arteriolar resistance.

TI  - Osmotic behavior and transport properties of human islets in a dimethyl sulfoxide solution.  
AB  - The osmotic responses of isolated human islets were evaluated using a perfusion cryomicroscope device. Individual islet volumes were measured following equilibration with a series of solutions of graded solute concentration. The osmotically inactive volume for human islets was determined to be 25% from a Boyle-van't Hoff plot of these data. A network thermodynamic model was developed via the bond graph method to describe the transport of water and cryoprotective agent in pancreatic islets. The model was curve fit to transient volumetric data for the response of islets to a stepwise exposure to 1 Me2SO at temperatures of 24.0, 3.0, or -3.5 degrees C. Standard membrane transport parameters (Lp, omega, sigma) and interstitial diffusion transport properties (kappa w, kappa p) were calculated from the fitting procedure. The temperature coefficients for membrane transport properties were expressed in terms of activation energies for water (ELp) and Me2SO (E omega). Osmotic challenge experiments conducted with fresh and cryopreserved human islets indicate that frozen/thawed islets exhibit a a slight increase in transport properties.

TI  - Patient-ventilator trigger asynchrony in prolonged mechanical ventilation.  
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient-ventilator trigger asynchrony (TA), its prevalence, physiologic basis, and clinical implications in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive and prospective cohort study. SETTING: Barlow Respiratory Hospital (BRH), a regional weaning center. PATIENTS: Two hundred consecutive ventilator-dependent patients, transferred to BRH over an 18-month period for attempted weaning from PMV. METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assessed clinically for TA within the first week of hospital admission, or once they were in hemodynamically stable condition, by observation of uncoupling of accessory respiratory muscle efforts and onset of machine breaths. Patients were excluded if they had weaned by the time of assessment or if they never achieved hemodynamic stability. Ventilator mode was patient triggered, flow control, volume cycled, with a tidal volume of 7 to 10 mL/kg. Esophageal pressure (Peso), airway-opening pressure, and airflow were measured in patients with TA who consented to esophageal catheter insertion. Attempts to decrease TA in each patient included application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) stepwise to 10 cm H2O, flow triggering, and reduction of ventilator support in pressure support (PS) mode. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge, when outcomes were scored as weaned (defined as >7 days of ventilator independence), failed to wean, or died. RESULTS: Of the 200 patients screened, 26 were excluded and 19 were found to have TA. Patients with TA were older, carried the diagnosis of COPD more frequently, and had more severe hypercapnia than their counterparts without TA. Only 3 of 19 patients (16%), all with intermittent TA, weaned from mechanical ventilation, after 70, 72, and 108 days, respectively. This is in contrast to a weaning success rate of 57%, with a median (range) time to wean of 33 (3 to 182) days in patients without TA. Observation of uncoupling of accessory respiratory muscle movement and onset of machine breaths was accurate in identifying patients with TA, which was confirmed in all seven patients consenting to Peso monitoring. TA appeared to result from high auto-PEEP and severe pump failure. Adjusting trigger sensitivity and application of flow triggering were unsuccessful in eliminating TA; external PEEP improved but rarely led to elimination of TA that was transient in duration. Reduction of ventilator support in PS mode, with resultant increased respiratory pump output and lower tidal volumes, uniformly succeeded in eliminating TA. However, this approach imposed a fatiguing load on the respiratory muscles and was poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: TA can be easily identified clinically, and when it occurs in the patient in stable condition with PMV, is associated with poor outcome.

TI  - Identification of two nervous system-specific members of the erg potassium channel gene family.  
AB  - Two new potassium channel genes, erg2 and erg3, that are expressed in the nervous system of the rat were identified. These two genes form a small gene family with the previously described erg1 (HERG) gene. The erg2 and erg3 genes are expressed exclusively in the nervous system, in marked contrast to erg1, which is expressed in both neural and non-neural tissues. All three genes are expressed in peripheral sympathetic ganglia. The erg3 channel produces a current that has a large transient component at positive potentials, whereas the other two channels are slowly activating delayed rectifiers. Expression of the erg1 gene in the sympathetic nervous system has potential implications for the etiology of the LQT2 form of the human genetic disease long QT syndrome.

TI  - hsp27 as a switch between differentiation and apoptosis in murine embryonic stem cells.  
AB  - Small stress proteins are developmentally regulated and linked to cell growth and differentiation. The early phase of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, characterized by a gradual growth arrest, is accompanied with hsp27 transient accumulation. This differentiation process also correlated with changes in hsp27 phosphorylation and oligomerization. The role of hsp27 was investigated in ES clones stably transfected with murine or human hsp27 genes, placed in sense or antisense orientation. Several clones were obtained that either underexpressed endogenous murine hsp27 or overexpressed murine or human hsp27. Maintained undifferentiated, these clones showed similar growth rates. We report here that hsp27 constitutive overexpression enhanced the differentiation-mediated decreased rate of ES cell proliferation but did not alter morphological changes. In contrast, hsp27 underexpression, which attenuated cell growth arrest, induced differentiation abortion because of an overall cell death by apoptosis. Recently, we showed that hsp27 interfered with cell death probably because of its ability to modulate intracellular glutathione. hsp27 accumulation during ES cell differentiation was also correlated with an increase in glutathione, which was attenuated by hsp27 down-expression. Hence, hsp27 transient expression seems essential for preventing differentiating ES cells from undergoing apoptosis, a switch that may be redox regulated.

TI  - The relationship between transience and current life situation in the homeless services-using population.  
AB  - Although transience has been the focus of an enormous amount of public attention, there has been limited empirical research on transience in the homeless population. The purpose of the study discussed in this article was to develop a construct of transience for the homeless services-using population. Transience was defined as consisting of four factors: migration, duration, intention, and involvement. This construct was used to predict current housing and employment status, substance use, receipt of entitlements, and health and mental health services use. The study collected data on 146 individuals. Findings suggest the validity of the study's conceptualization of transience, particularly in its ability to predict current substance use. This study also found indirect evidence for one previously proposed profile of transients--the "transient substance abuser," but this profile may have two categories--used drugs or used alcohol.

TI  - Patterns of lower esophageal sphincter function associated with gastroesophageal reflux.  
AB  - Studies in which lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal pH have been monitored simultaneously have challenged the traditional concept that most reflux episodes result from weak steady state lower esophageal sphincter tone. Instead, the majority of reflux episodes have occurred during 5-35-second abrupt periods of complete sphincter relaxation usually against a background of normal sphincter tone. This distinctive pattern of relaxation, which has been named "transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation," occurs independently of swallowing. It depends on vagal pathways and the hindbrain for its patterning and control, but many of these aspects are still not well understood. Control of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation by drug therapy is an attractive future option for management of supraesophageal complications of reflux disease.

TI  - Prolonged effect of a novel S-nitrosated glyco-amino acid in endothelium-denuded rat femoral arteries: potential as a slow release nitric oxide donor drug.  
AB  - 1. The vasodilator properties of a novel S-nitrosated glyco-amino acid (RIG200) were investigated in isolated rat femoral arteries and compared with those of the parent S-nitrosothiol compound, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). 2. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed that 2.5 mM solutions of RIG200 decomposed more slowly (half-life (t1/2) = 216.2 +/- 26.7 min) than SNAP (t1/2 = 37.2 +/- 13.8 min) in Krebs buffer at 24 degrees C. Furthermore, the rate of decomposition of SNAP, but not of RIG200, was significantly reduced by the Cu(I) chelator, neocuproine. We concluded that the relative stability of RIG200 is due, at least in part, to its resistance to trace Cu(I)-catalyzed decomposition. Nitric oxide (NO) generation from SNAP and RIG200 was confirmed by use of an NO electrode. 3. Experiments to investigate the vasodilator effects of RIG200 were carried out on isolated femoral arteries taken from adult male Wistar rats (400-550 g). Lengths of artery (7-8 mm long) were cannulated, dissected free and perfused at constant flow rate (0.6 ml min-1) with Krebs buffer. Vessels were precontracted with phenylephrine (10.2 +/- 0.3 microM) and developed pressures of 91.8 +/- 4 mmHg, detected upstream by a differential pressure transducer. 4. Concentration-dependent vasodilator responses to bolus injections of SNAP or RIG200 (10 microliters; 10(-8)-10(-3) M) made into the perfusate of endothelium-intact vessels were transient, recovering the preinjection pressure in < 20 min. 5. Responses to equivalent bolus injections of SNAP in endothelium-denuded vessels were also transient but those in response to concentrations of RIG200 > 10(-5) M were sustained. Responses to 10(-3) M RIG200 were sustained for periods > 4 h. Sustained vasodilatation was reversed by the NO scavenger, ferrohaemoglobin (10 microM) but was unaffected by the NO synthase inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (200 microM), indicating involvement of NO from a source other than NO synthase. 6. We suggest that a possible explanation for the prolonged effect of RIG200 is retention of the compound by the vascular wall, facilitated by endothelial denudation. Slow decomposition of RIG200 in situ would release sufficient NO to maintain a 'vasodilator tone' which persists for more than 4 h. Selective retention by damaged vessels could have important therapeutic implications with regard to targeted delivery of NO, restoring protection to areas deprived of endogenous NO, whilst avoiding unwanted hypotension.

Because the proton release group deprotonates after 70-100 micros and has a transient pKa of 5.8, these results suggest the following assignment: the fast and the combination of fast and slow components represent photoreversal from two M states, with the release group protonated and deprotonated, respectively.

TI  - Evidence for the first phase of the reprotonation switch of bacteriorhodopsin from time-resolved photovoltage and flash photolysis experiments on the photoreversal of the M-intermediate.  
AB  - The kinetics of the photoreversal reaction of the M-intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) was investigated by time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy and photovoltage measurements using double-flash excitation (a green flash (532 nm) followed by a blue flash (400 nm) after a variable delay). The sign of the photovoltage and the 1H/2H kinetic isotope effect indicate that the Schiff base is reprotonated by a group between the Schiff base and the extracellular surface, probably Asp85. Analysis of the kinetic data shows that the charge movement in 150 mM KCl at 12 degrees C is characterized by two components with time constants of approximately 100 ns and approximately 600 ns, respectively, which are independent of the delay time between the flashes and the pH. The amplitudes of the fast and slow components depend on the delay and the pH. The slower component starts to contribute to the charge movement only after delays longer than 100 micros, is absent at low pH, and increases in amplitude with a pKa of approximately 6. Because the proton release group deprotonates after 70-100 micros and has a transient pKa of 5.8, these results suggest the following assignment: the fast and the combination of fast and slow components represent photoreversal from two M states, with the release group protonated and deprotonated, respectively. The slow phase of the photoreversal starts from a state with the release group deprotonated, and with the pK of Asp85 elevated, and is probably due to the restoration of the pK of Asp85 to its initial low value. This provides further evidence for coupling between the pK's of Asp85 and the release group and suggests that proton release is the first step in the reprotonation switch. At alkaline pH the amplitude of the electrical signal from the back photoreaction decreases with an apparent pK of 8, without a corresponding decrease in the amount of M. At neutral pH the movement of the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg82 from a position near the release group on the surface to Asp85 makes a substantial contribution to the electrical photoreversal amplitude. Above the pK of the release group in the unphotolysed state (approximately 8), Arg82 stays near the surface, leading to a corresponding signal reduction.

The failure to know about the rural past and to learn from it has resulted in a 20-year cycle of rediscovery.

TI  - Identification of a protein isolated from senescent human cells that binds to hepatitis B virus X antigen.  
AB  - Hepatitis B virus-encoded X antigen contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Given that X antigen functions by binding to other proteins, additional X-binding proteins were sought from an adult human liver cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. The results yielded a clone encoding a 55-kd protein that is associated with replicative senescence (p55sen). Binding of p55sen to X antigen was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography. The expression of endogenous p55sen inversely correlated with cell growth.  Transient transfection of X antigen or p55sen into HepG2 cells stimulated DNA synthesis by twofold to threefold, whereas cotransfection did not, suggesting that these molecules functionally interact. The detection of p55sen in embryonic mouse liver, its absence in adult mouse and human livers, and its reappearance in livers from carriers with chronic liver disease, suggest that it may play important roles in the regulation of liver cell growth. The similarity between p55sen and a notch ligand, which is involved in cell fate determinations during embryogenesis, implies that the binding of p55sen by X antigen may also contribute to an alteration in cell fate, which is characteristic of carcinogenesis.

TI  - Hypoxia-induced inhibition of calcium channels in guinea-pig taenia caeci smooth muscle cells.  
AB  - 1. The effects of hypoxia on whole-cell current in single smooth muscle cells and on a high K(+)-induced contraction of strips of the guinea-pig taenia caeci were studied. 2. In physiological salt solution (PSS) and K(+)-based pipette solution, hypoxia (PO2 = 20 mmHg) reversibly inhibited both the inward Ca2+ current (ICa) and outward Ca(2+)-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) components of the whole-cell current. 3. In PSS and Cs(+)-based pipette solution, hypoxia reversibly suppressed ICa by 30 +/- 5% at 0 mV. 4. When Ba2+ was used as a charge carrier, the IBa was suppressed by hypoxia in a potential-dependent manner, with the maximum of 40 +/- 7% at +10 mV. Alterations of concentrations of EGTA, GDB beta S or ATP in the pipette solution did not change the inhibitory effects of hypoxia on ICa and IBa. 5. In PSS with 2 mM CaCl2 replaced by CoCl2, hypoxia did not affect the Ca2+ influx-independent potassium current. 6. In cells voltage clamped at -20 mV hypoxia reversibly inhibited the spontaneous transient outward currents. 7. The response of high K(+)-contracted taenia caeci to hypoxia was composed of an initial rapid relaxation followed by a small transient contraction and slow relaxation.  The transient contraction was blocked by atropine (1-10 microM), while relaxations were unaffected by atropine and guanethidine (10 microM). 8. The results show that hypoxia reversibly inhibits ICa and secondarily suppresses IK(Ca) due to decreased Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels. 9. It is suggested that inhibition of ICa was responsible for the rapid relaxation, whereas transient contraction may have been due to release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals upon hypoxia.

TI  - Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions hearing screening in high-risk newborns.  
AB  - Universal infant hearing screening has recently been recommended by the National Institutes of Health. Otoacoustic emissions have been proposed as the first-level screening technique. Although transient evoked otoacoustic emissions have shown limited applications, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions hold promise as a screening technique but have not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions as a hearing screening technique. A total of 208 ears of 104 infants at risk for hearing loss were tested with both automated auditory brain stem response and distortion-product otoacoustic emission screening protocols. Acoustic brain stem response results were used as the standard for normal hearing. Distortion-product otoacoustic emission results were analyzed by means of calculation of the difference between the mean of the response levels and the mean of the noise floor levels from five frequency pairs between 2000 and 4000 Hz. Pass-fail rates for response above noise floor criteria of 5, 10, and 15 dB were examined. The sensitivity of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions was 50%, 67%, and 87%, and the specificity was 94%, 68%, and 38% at the 5, 10, and 15 dB levels, respectively. The pass-fail criterion of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions should be based on instrumentation calibration, infant status, and an acceptable false-positive, false-negative yield. The ability to test rapidly the hearing of all infants with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions points to the feasibility of using this test as a first-stage screen.

TI  - Palpebral conjunctival transient amplifying cells originate at the mucocutaneous junction and their progeny migrate toward the fornix.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The conjunctival epithelium performs an important role in the homeostasis and integrity of the eye. These cells need to be replaced in order to protect the integrity of the ocular surface. Epithelial cells are replaced from slow cycling stem cells which in turn produce transient amplifying cells that undergo further divisions before becoming mature conjunctival epithelial cells. The natural history of the bulbar palpebral conjunctival cells has not been previously described. METHODS: A single injection of bromodeoxyuridine (brdU), a thymidine analogue, was administered intraperitoneally to adult rabbits at a concentration of 50 mg/kg body weight. The rabbits were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days following the injections. The orbital contents including the eyelids were exenerated en bloc, frozen in a manner that maintained the orientation and continuity between the eyelids and globe and sectioned in a parasagittal plane. The tissue was stained immunohistochemically to detect brdU labeled conjunctival epithelial cells. The brdU-positive epithelial cells were counted in a series of 0.4 mm zones starting at the mucocutaneous junction of the eyelid and progressing through the fornix and bulbar conjunctiva. Rabbit eyelids and human eyelid surgical specimens were stained for cyclin D1, a marker for cells that are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. RESULTS: In both the upper and lower eyelids, the peak number of brdU labeled cells/0.4 mm zone was located at progressively greater distances from the mucocutaneous junction in the animals sacrificed at 1, 3 and 5 days respectively, and gone by 7 days. A focus of brdU-labeled conjunctival cells remained within 1-2 mm of the mucocutaneous junction at all post-injection intervals. Foci of cyclin 1-positive cells were found almost exclusively near the mucocutaneous junction, but not in the fornix. CONCLUSIONS: The mucocutaneous junction of the conjunctival epithelium is a source of actively dividing transient amplifying cells that migrate toward the fornix at a rate of about 1.7 mm/day as replacement conjunctiva so that at least some conjunctival epithelial stem cells must be located near the mucocutaneous junction. The presence of cyclin D1 staining cells at the mucocutaneous junction supports this view. These results are not necessarily at variance with previous studies, but they do diminish the relative importance assigned the forniceal region in palpabral conjunctival homeostasis. Moreover, the mucocutaneous junction might provide a therapeutically significant source of replacement conjunctival cells. The transit time of conjunctival epithelial cells is about 6 days.

AB  - The relative importance of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the initial and terminal phases of relaxation and the decline in the [Ca2+]i transient was investigated in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fluo 3. For electrically stimulated contractions, the peak intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was 700 +/- 87 nM and end-diastolic [Ca2+]i was 239 +/- 30 nM (0.25 Hz, 37 degrees C, 1.08 mM extracellular Ca2+ concentration; n = 14). Abrupt inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange was produced by removal of extracellular Na+ (KCl substitution) and Ca2+ [2 mM Ca(2+)-free ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl either)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] by means of a rapid switcher device (SW). Abrupt exposure to high K+ induced an action potential, although sufficient Ca2+ remained adjacent to the sarcolemma to induce a contraction (SW beat) and [Ca2+]i transient that were identical in amplitude to those induced by electrical stimulation (ES beat). The initial relaxation and decline in the [Ca2+]i transient was not significantly prolonged by abrupt elimination of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, but the rate and extent of the terminal phase of the decline in the [Ca2+]i transient were significantly reduced. The first derivative of [Ca2+]i with respect to time versus [Ca2+]i during the decline of the [Ca2+]i transient attributable to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function was estimated from the average SW transients, and that attributable to Na+/Ca2+ exchange was estimated from the difference between SW and ES transients. By this analysis, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger produces 13% of the first half of the decline in [Ca2+]i and 45% of the second half of the decline. We conclude that abrupt inhibition of forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange does not significantly affect the amplitude or the initial rate of decline of the [Ca2+]i transient and relaxation. However, its contribution to the reduction of [Ca2+]i becomes apparent late during the [Ca2+]i transient, when cytosolic [Ca2+]i has been reduced.

TI  - Specific interaction of wild-type and truncated mouse N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase with ethenoadenine-containing DNA.  
AB  - N-Methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), a ubiquitous DNA repair enzyme, is responsible for the removal of a wide variety of alkylated base lesions in DNA, e.g., N-alkylpurines and cyclic ethenoadducts of adenine, guanine, and cytosine. These lesions, some of which are mutagenic and toxic, are generated endogenously or by genotoxic agents such as N-alkylnitrosamines and vinyl chloride. Wild-type mouse MPG, expressed from recombinant baculovirus, was purified to near homogeneity for studying its specific interaction with substrate, 1,N6-ethenoadenine- (epsilonA-) containing DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that MPG formed a specific complex with a 50-mer epsilonA-containing duplex oligonucleotide. This complex was shown to be a transient reaction intermediate, because it could be formed only with the unreacted substrate and contained active enzyme molecules. DNA footprinting studies confirmed the specific binding of the protein to the epsilonA-containing duplex oligonucleotide; eight nucleotides on the epsilonA-containing strand and 16-17 nucleotides in the complementary strand spanning the base adduct were protected from DNase I digestion. A systematic deletion analysis of MPG was carried out in order to determine the minimally sized polypeptide capable of forming a stable substrate complex that is also suitable for characterization by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. A truncated polypeptide (NDelta100CDelta18) lacking 100 and 18 amino acid residues from the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively, was found to be the minimal size that retained activity. The truncated and wild-type enzymes have similar kinetic properties. Moreover, both EMSA and DNase I footprinting studies indicated identical pattern of specific binding by the truncated and full-length polypeptides. Removal of five and nine additional residues from the amino- and carboxyl-termini of this polypeptide, respectively, resulted in a complete loss of activity. These results suggest that minimal structural change occured as a result of truncation in the NDelta100CDelta18 mutant, which may thus be suitable for elucidating the structure and mechanism of MPG.

TI  - Mammary tumours in Sprague-Dawley rats after initiation with DMBA followed by exposure to 50 Hz electromagnetic fields in a promotional scheme.  
AB  - In order to test whether a transient-producing intermittent magnetic field (MF) acts as a promoter in rat mammary tumour development, a study of a 50 Hz sinusoidal MF with flux densities of 0.25 and 0.5 mT was performed on female Sprague-Dawley rats. A single administration of 7 mg of 7,12-dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) was given by gavage to 52-day-old animals. After 1 week, exposure to an intermittent (15 s on/15 s off) transient-associated magnetic field was started. MF exposure was performed for 19 or 21 h per day up to 25 weeks, when the study was terminated. Twice a week a careful examination with palpation for tumours was done. Tumour incidence, the number of tumours per animal, tumour volume and tumour weight were recorded. A total of 70% of MF-exposed animals developed tumours. For animals exposed to DMBA alone the correspondent figure was 71.7%. No statistical differences were seen either for tumour-bearing animals or for the total number of tumours. A slightly larger total tumour weight and tumour volume was seen for animals exposed to 0.25 mT MF. These differences were not statistically significant.

TI  - Round-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon fluviatilis) snf5 gene is oriented in a tail-to-tail manner with the set gene which encodes an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A.  
AB  - The round-spotted pufferfish Tetraodon fluviatilis has a genome size of 380 Mb which is slightly smaller than that of another pufferfish Fugu rubripes rubripes (Fugu). Due to its compact genome and small introns, Fugu has been introduced as a model for genome studies. Recently, the round-spotted pufferfish has also been proposed as a new model for genome studies because of the ease in obtaining material and high-sequence homology to that of Fugu. In this study, we have cloned and characterized the snf5 and set genes from the round-spotted pufferfish. The snf5 gene is composed of 9 exons spanning about 2.9 kb whereas the set gene consists of 8 exons spanning about 2.7 kb. They are linked in a tail-to-tail manner with an intergenic region of about 6.5 kb. So far, the genomic structures of human snf5 and set genes are unknown. Based on our data, the pufferfish SNF5 and SET display high amino acid sequence identity (>90%) with the respective human genes. By primer extension and sequence analysis, we found that putative promoter region of the snf5 gene contains a typical TATA box and numerous potential binding sites for transcription factors including AP1, AP2, AP3, c-Myb, HNF-5, and NF-IL6. As for the set gene, its promoter region does not have any TATA or CCAAT motif and contains a few potential binding sites for transcriptional factors such as c-Myb and gamma-IRE. When these promoter regions were placed upstream of the CAT reporter gene and transfected into a carp CF cell line, the 5'-upstream 1.6-kb DNA fragment of the snf5 gene displayed stronger promoter activity, approximately three-fold higher than that of the 5'-upstream 1.3 kb DNA fragment of the set gene.  By transient expression and immunofluorescent staining, we also showed that the pufferfish SNF5 and SET are nuclear proteins, consistent with their postulated roles as transcriptional factors.

TI  - Activation of the ferritin H enhancer, FER-1, by the cooperative action of members of the AP1 and Sp1 transcription factor families.  
AB  - We have previously reported that the adenovirus E1A oncogene represses the transcription of the H subunit of the mouse ferritin gene. Subsequent analyses defined FER-1, a 37-nucleotide sequence located 4.1 kilobases proximal to the start site of transcription, as the target of E1A-mediated transcriptional repression and as an enhancer of the ferritin H gene. FER-1 is composed of an AP1-like sequence followed by an element with dyad symmetry. To achieve maximal enhancer activity and transcriptional repression by E1A, both elements were essential. Using gel retardation assays, we now demonstrate that the binding complex for the AP1-like sequence of FER-1 contains JunD, FosB, and ATF1. Furthermore, JunD and FosB were able to activate FER-1 enhancer activity by transient cotransfection with ferritin H-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs. This augmented enhancer activity was inhibited by E1A. In addition, we have defined the minimal sequence in the dyad element of FER-1 required for protein interaction. This was determined to be a C-rich sequence to which Sp1 and Sp3 bind. Experiments with recombinant proteins indicate that members of both transcription factor families simultaneously bind FER-1. Taken together, these results elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of a pivotal gene in iron metabolism and provide insights into the contribution of the Sp1 family to the activation of AP1-dependent enhancers.

TI  - Identification of a protein essential for replication of porcine circovirus.  
AB  - The largest open reading frame of porcine circovirus (ORF 4) encodes a protein of 312 amino acids. The predicted gene product of ORF 4 shows similarities to Rep proteins of other plant circoviruses and geminiviruses. Three motifs have been identified that are characteristic for proteins involved in rolling circle replication and the consensus sequence for a putative dNTP-binding box (GKS) has been found. In this paper, experimental evidence is presented which indicates that ORF 4 encodes the replication protein of porcine circovirus. After cloning of the ORF 4 gene product, it was supplied in trans in a transient replication assay. The ORF 4 gene product promoted the replication of plasmid pOP11, which carries the origin of DNA replication of porcine circovirus. Since pOP11 itself is unable to replicate in virus-free porcine kidney cells, the ORF 4 gene product must be essential for replication of porcine circovirus.

TI  - Effect of Cheyne-Stokes respiration on muscle sympathetic nerve activity in severe congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - Severe congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with Cheyne-Stokes (C-S) respiration, which may be an index of poorer prognosis. The mechanisms linking C-S respiration to poorer functional status and prognosis in patients with CHF are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that C-S respiration increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 9 patients with CHF. Oxygen saturation was 96 +/- 1% during normal breathing and 91 +/- 1% after the apneic episodes (p < 0.05). Mean blood pressure was 79 +/- 8 mm Hg during normal breathing and 85 +/- 8 mm Hg during C-S respiration (p = 0.001). C-S respiration increased MSNA burst frequency (from 45 +/- 5 bursts/min during normal breathing to 50 +/- 5 bursts/min during C-S respiration; p < 0.05) and total integrated nerve activity (to 117 +/- 7%; p < 0.05). We also studied an additional 5 patients in whom C-S breathing was constant, without any periods of spontaneous normal breathing. In these patients, MSNA was higher (65 +/- 5 bursts/min) than MSNA in patients in whom C-S breathing was only intermittent (45 +/- 5 bursts/min; p < 0.05). In all 14 patients, the effects of different phases of C-S respiration were examined. MSNA was highest during the second half of each apnea (increasing to 152 +/- 14%; p < 0.01) and blood pressure was highest during mild hyperventilation occurring after termination of apnea (p < 0.0001). We conclude that C-S respiration decreases oxygen saturation, increases MSNA, and induces transient elevations in blood pressure in patients with CHF.

TI  - A periodogram-based method for the detection of steady-state visually evoked potentials.

Flicker-burst stimulation--a physiological sensible combination of transient and steady-state stimulation--is used to generate deterministic sinusoidal responses or visually evoked potentials (VEP's) at the visual cortex, which are derived from the electroencephalogram by a suitable electrode array. In this paper we develop a new method for the detection of VEP's. Based on the periodogram of a time-series, we test the data for the presence of hidden periodic components, which correspond to steady-state VEP's. The method is applied successfully to real data.

TI  - Two distinct low-voltage-activated Ca2+ currents contribute to the pacemaker mechanism in cockroach dorsal unpaired median neurons.  
AB  - 1. The contribution of Ca2+ currents to the endogenous firing properties of cockroach isolated adult dorsal unpaired median neurons was investigated using whole cell patch-clamp technique with 5 mM Ca2+ as the charge carrier. At least three types of Ca2+ currents, a high-voltage-activated Ca2+ current and two low-voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ currents, have been found in these neurons. This study focused on the LVA Ca2+ currents, which are suitable candidates in the generation of the slow predepolarization because of their low threshold of activation. 2. The global LVA Ca2+ current could be dissociated by means of nickel sensitivity, deactivation time constant and voltage dependence of time to peak, tail current amplitude and inactivation, as transient and maintained LVA Ca2+ currents. 3. The transient LVA Ca2+ current, sensitive to 100 microM Ni2+, was isolated by using a subtraction procedure. It was activated at -70 mV and half-inactivated at -59.5 mV. The inactivation was purely voltage dependent. Current-clamp experiments performed with 150 microM Ni2+ indicated that this current was involved in the initial part of the predepolarization. 4. The maintained LVA Ca2+ current, resistant to 100 microM Ni2+, was activated in a range of potential 10 mV more positive than the transient LVA Ca2+ current, and its voltage dependence of inactivation displayed a U-shaped-curve. 5. Replacing Ca2+ with Ba2+ in equimolar amount or low internal Ca2+ concentration [5 mM bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) in the pipette] induced a monotonic voltage dependence of inactivation and increased the rate of relaxation of this current. These effects were mimicked by high internal Ca2+ concentration [0.1 mM Ca2+ and no ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid in the pipette]. This demonstrated an unusual Ca2+-sensitive inactivation process that varied over a narrow range of Ca2+ concentrations. 6. Current-clamp experiments performed under 150 microM Ni2+, with 15 mM external Ca2+ concentration (which potentiated the maintained LVA current within 30 s of superfusion) or with 5 mM BAPTA in the pipette demonstrated the participation of this current in the last two-thirds of the slow predepolarizing phase. 7. Our findings demonstrated, for the first time in neurosecretory cells, the coexistence of two distinct LVA Ca2+ currents, which have specialized function in the generation of the pacemaker activity.

TI  - Peripheral nerve regeneration: comparison of laminin and acidic fibroblast growth factor.  
AB  - PURPOSE: In an effort to show the differences between neurotrophic factors, laminin and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) were compared in terms of their abilities to regenerate axons in vivo over an extended distance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sciatic nerve was transected in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. A 15-mm Silastic tube (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was placed between the ends of the cut nerve and filled with either laminin, aFGF, or buffer applied to collagen sponges. RESULTS: Ten weeks postimplantation, mean axon counts showed that both laminin (2432) and aFGF (1612) produced significantly higher numbers of axons than controls (1009) (P < .05) and that laminin showed significantly more nerve regeneration than aFGF (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that laminin and aFGF enhance peripheral nerve regeneration across a large gap, presumably through their neurotrophic effects and mitogenic properties on supporting cells. Furthermore, it is concluded that the transient nature of aFGF's effect on the regenerative environment limits its effectiveness at regenerating axons over a prolonged period of time.

TI  - Cardiovascular T-type calcium channels: physiological and pharmacological significance.  
AB  - CELLULAR CALCIUM REGULATION: A variety of Ca2+ control processes are responsible for Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are dominant in the cardiovascular system. VOLTAGE-GATED Ca2+ CHANNELS: There are several distinct subclasses of Ca2+ channels, distinguished by location, biophysical, structural and pharmacological characteristics. They include both high- and low-voltage-activated channels. The long-lasting (L) type of high-voltage-activated channel is well characterized and is the site of action for the existing clinically available Ca2+ channel antagonists: nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem. T-TYPE Ca2+ CHANNELS: The low-voltage-activated transient (T-type) channel is widespread in the cardiovascular system and in neurons. It serves pacemaking functions and supports Ca2+ signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. The T-type channel also functions in cell growth processes under physiological and pathological conditions. MIBEFRADIL AS A T-TYPE Ca2+ CHANNEL ANTAGONIST: Mibefradil (Ro 40-5967) is a structurally novel Ca2+ antagonist with selectivity for T-type over L-type channels. This selectivity may underlie its vasodilating activity and heart rate depressive effect, its lack of negative inotropy and its cardioprotective properties.

TI  - Sex, time-of-day and estrous variations in behavioral and bladder histological consequences of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats.  
AB  - This study examined how cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced cystitis related manifestations (bladder inflammation and behavioral impairment) differed in female and male Sprague-Dawley rats.  Under transient halothane-O2-N2O gas anesthesia, a single dose of CP was injected (100 mg/kg i.p. in 1 ml saline) and the animal's behaviors analyzed for a period of 4 h using a protocol that permits quantitative analysis of behavioral impairment. The rats were then sacrificed and their bladders removed for histological quantification of inflammation. All CP-injected, but not control rats, exhibited a range of impairment behaviors that increased rapidly over a period of 2 h, gradually reaching plateau levels over the next 2 h. Female rats initially developed behavioral responses faster than male rats, but reached the same mean peak values overall as males. No sex differences were observed in CP-induced bladder inflammation. Influences of time-of-day and estrous stage were further examined in females. Time-of-day had no effect on the degree of bladder inflammation. Although there were also no significant time-of-day differences in behavioral impairments, impairment scores from 90 min after the injection consistently tended to be lower for rats injected 5 h versus 9 h after lights on. Overall, the effects of estrous stage were also insignificant. However, a subset of rats who were in the estrous stage of their cycle early in the morning of the experimental day developed the most severe degree of bladder inflammation, but failed to develop the severe behavioral impairments shown by all the other rats. These results show that there are seemingly only minor sex differences in the overall behavioral and inflammatory consequences of CP injections, as evidenced by similar final degrees of behavioral impairment and inflammation. These results also suggest, however, that there are sex differences in the etiology of the disease process. These differences are evidenced by the more rapid development of behavioral symptoms in females and the susceptibility of some of those having shown morning estrous smears to develop very severe bladder inflammation in absence of corresponding behavioral impairment. The multiple influences of sex and estrous condition on CP-induced cystitis related manifestations observed here underline the complexity of the etiological factors associated with the cystitis disease process.

TI  - Transient surfactant protein B deficiency in a term infant with severe respiratory failure [see comments]  
AB  - A 38-day-old male infant with persistent pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure since birth was found to have a complete absence of surfactant protein B (SP-B) along with an aberrant form of SP-C in his tracheal aspirate fluid, findings consistent with the diagnosis of hereditary SP-B deficiency. Surprisingly, SP-B and SP-B messenger ribonucleic acid were present in lung biopsy tissue. However, DNA sequence analysis demonstrated a point mutation in exon 5 of one of the SP-B gene alleles. The infant's mother was found to be a carrier of this mutation. The infant's other SP-B allele did not differ from the published DNA sequence for the SP-B gene. We conclude that this patient had a transient deficiency of SP-B, in contrast to that of previously described infants with irreversible respiratory failure caused by hereditary SP-B deficiency. We recommend that infants with suspected SP-B deficiency have serial analysis of tracheal fluid samples for both SP-B and SP-C before lung biopsy, along with genetic analysis for the known SP-B mutations. We speculate that the new mutation found in one of this patient's SP-B genes was in part responsible for the transient deficiency of SP-B.

TI  - Developmental profile and synaptic origin of early network oscillations in the CA1 region of rat neonatal hippocampus.  
AB  - 1. By applying fura-2-based fluorometric calcium imaging to neonatal rat hippocampal slices we identified a developmentally regulated spontaneous neuronal activity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The activity consisted of bursts of intracellular Ca2+ transients recurring synchronously at a slow rate of 0.4-2 min-1 in the entire population of pyramidal neurones and interneurones. 2. These early network oscillations (ENOs) were present during a restricted period of postnatal development. Thus, they were not detected at the day of birth (P0), at P1-P4 they consisted of bursts of large (up to 1.5 microM) Ca2+ transients, gradually transforming into regularly occurring, smaller Ca2+ transients during the subsequent week. Beyond P15-P16 no ENOs were detected. 3. The ENOs were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and by a reduction in temperature from 33-35 degrees C to 20-22 degrees C. By combining fluorometric imaging with whole-cell current-clamp recordings, we found that each ENO-related Ca2+ transient was associated with a high-frequency (up to 100 Hz) train of action potentials riding on a depolarizing wave. 4. Recordings in the voltage-clamp mode revealed barrages of synaptic currents that were strictly correlated with the ENO-associated Ca2+ transients in neighbouring pyramidal neurones. Perfusing the cells with an intracellular solution that allowed for a discrimination between GABAA and glutamate receptor-mediated currents showed that these barrages of synaptic currents were predominantly of GABAergic origin. 5. The ENOs were totally blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline and they were also substantially reduced by the glutamatergic antagonists D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D, L-APV) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). 6. Synaptic stimulation and application of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol mimicked the spontaneous Ca2+ transients in pyramidal neurones. The efficacy of muscimol in evoking Ca2+ transients decreased during development in parallel with the gradual disappearance of the ENOs. 7. The developmental decrease in the amplitude of ENO-associated Ca2+ transients occurred in parallel with the transformation of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus from the immature GABAergic to the mature glutamatergic form. Thus, at the beginning of the first postnatal week single-shock synaptic stimulation produced Ca2+ transients that were completely blocked by bicuculline. At the end of the second postnatal week the same type of evoked synaptic stimulation produced a Ca2+ transient that was little affected by bicuculline but was abolished by the combined application of D,L-APV and CNQX. 8. These results demonstrate the presence of periodic and spontaneous Ca2+ transients in the majority of pyramidal cells and interneurones of the neonatal CA1 hippocampal network. These ENOs exhibit a highly region-specific developmental profile and may control the activity-dependent wiring of the synaptic connectivity during early postnatal development.

TI  - The enantiomer-specific kinetics and dynamics of verapamil after rapid intravenous administration to sheep: physiological analysis and modeling.  
AB  - The lung, myocardial and systemic kinetics of the enantiomers of verapamil, and their myocardial effects, were measured after administration of 10 mg of racemic verapamil during 2 min to chronically instrumented sheep; the data were used to develop a physiological model of the process. Verapamil was characterized by relatively slow transit through the lungs and heart. The lung kinetic values were membrane limited, whereas the tissue/blood equilibrium half-life for the heart was approximately 8 min. There was little difference between the kinetic values of the enantiomers, with the exception of their extent of deep distribution into the lung. The time course of the increase in myocardial blood flow caused by verapamil was best related to the time course of the arterial verapamil concentrations, whereas the time course of increases in the interval between P and R waves of the electrocardiogram and decreases in the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure were best related to the time course of its myocardial concentrations. Thus, the observed hysteresis for these effects compared with arterial blood was largely caused by the time required for the myocardial equilibration. The model predicted that the myocardial concentrations of verapamil were relatively insensitive to the duration of injection of a given bolus dose, but that rapid injection caused transient, high arterial concentrations. It also predicted that the bolus dose of verapamil should be modified over a 2-fold range to account for physiologically plausible variations in base-line cardiac output and myocardial blood flow.

TI  - Regulating energy transfer in the ATP sulfurylase-GTPase system.  
AB  - ATP sulfurylase, isolated from Escherichia coli K-12, is a GTPase-target complex that catalyzes and links the energetics of GTP hydrolysis to the synthesis of activated sulfate (APS). When the GTP concentration is saturating and held fixed with a regenerating system, the APS reaction reaches a steady state in which its mass ratio is shifted (5.4 x 10(6))-fold toward the product by the hydrolysis of GTP. If GTP is not regenerated, the shift toward the product is transient, producing a pulse-shaped progress curve. The mechanistic basis of this transience is the subject of this paper. The product transient is caused by the binding of GDP to the enzyme which establishes a catalytic pathway that allows the chemical potential that had been transferred to the APS reaction to "leak" into the chemical milieu. The system leaks because the E.GDP complex catalyzes the uncoupled APS reaction. The addition of phosphate to the leaky GDP.E.APS.PPi complex converts it into the central Pi.GDP.E.APS.PPi complex which catalyzes the energy-transfer reaction. Thus, Pi binding directs the system through the coupled mechanism, "plugging" the leak. GMPPNP, which also causes a leak, is used to demonstrate that the mass ratio of the APS reaction can be "tuned" by adjusting flux through the coupled and uncoupled pathways. This energy-coupling mechanism provides a means for controlling the quantity of chemical potential transferred to the APS reaction. This versatile linkage might well be used to the cell's advantage to avoid the toxicity associated with an excess of activated sulfate.

TI  - Effects of nitric oxide donors, S-nitroso-L-cysteine and sodium nitroprusside, on the whole-cell and single channel currents in single myocytes of the guinea-pig proximal colon.  
AB  - 1. The nature of the membrane channels underlying the membrane conductance changes induced by the nitric oxide (NO) donors, S-nitroso-L-cysteine (NOCys) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were investigated in single myocytes isolated from the circular muscle layer of the guinea-pig proximal colon, by use of standard whole-cell and single channel recording techniques. 2. Under voltage clamp, depolarizing steps from -60 mV elicited a rapidly-developing, little-inactivating outward K+ current (IK) at potentials positive to -40 mV (at 20-25 degrees C). The steady-state level (ISS) of this K current increased in amplitude as the step potential was made to more positive potentials. If the depolarizing steps were made from a holding potential of -80 mV an additional rapidly activating and inactivating outward K+ current was also elicited, superimposed on IK. 3. At 20-25 degrees C, NOCys (2.5 microM), SNP (100 microM) and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (500 microM) increased the amplitude of ISS of IK elicited from a holding potential of -60 mV. In contrast, NOCys (2-5 microM) had little effect on ISS at 35 degrees C. Higher concentrations (> or = 5 microM at 20-25 degrees C and > or = 10 microM at 35 degrees C) of NOCys decreased the peak amplitude (I[Peak]) and ISS of IK in a concentration-dependent manner. This blockade of IK with NOCys was always associated with an increase of the holding current (IHold), due to the activation of a membrane conductance with a reversal potential between 0 and + 30 mV and which was reduced approximately 50% upon the addition of Cd2+ (1 mM). 4. NOCys (2.5 to 10 microM) or SNP (100 microM) increased the activity of large conductance Ca2+-activated (BK) K' channels in both cell-attached and excised inside-out patches, bathed in either a symmetrical high K+ (130 mM) or an asymmetrically K+ (6 mMout: 130 mMin) physiological saline. Increases in BK channel activity in NOCys (10 microM) or SNP (100 microM) were associated with an increase in the probability of BK channel opening (N.Po), and with a negative shift of the plots of ln(N.Po) against the patch potential, with little change in the slopes of these plots. In cell-attached patches, the increase in N.Po with NOCys was often associated with a decrease in the BK single channel conductance. 5. In both cell-attached and excised patches, NOCys (2.5 to 10 microM) also activated an additional population of channels which allowed inward current flow at potentials positive to EK. In excised inside-out patches bathed in asymmetrical K+ physiological saline, these single channel currents were 2-3 pA in amplitude at -30 mV and reversed in direction near + 10 mV, even if the NaCl (126 mM) concentration in the pipette solution had been replaced with an equimolar concentration of Na gluconate. 6. Under current clamp, NOCys (2.5 microM) and SNP (100 microM) had variable effects on the membrane potential of colonic myocytes, inducing either a small membrane hyperpolarization of <5 mV, or a slowly-developing membrane depolarization of about 5 mV. In contrast, NOCys (5 microM) produced a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was followed by a large depolarization of the membrane potential to positive potentials. The electrotonic potentials elicited in response to an injection of constant hyperpolarizing current (10 pA for 400 ms) were little changed during the NOCys (5 PM)-induced membrane hyperpolarization, but significantly reduced (to 61% of control) during the periods of membrane depolarization. 7. It was concluded that NOCys and SNP, directly increased the number of active BK channels in the membrane of colonic myocytes which leads to a small rapidly oscillating membrane hyperpolarization. The following rebound depolarization in NOCys arises from both the direct opening of a population of cationic channels and the blockade of voltage- and Ca-activated K+ condu

TI  - Differential expression of Kv4 K+ channel subunits mediating subthreshold transient K+ (A-type) currents in rat brain.  
AB  - The mammalian Kv4 gene subfamily and its Drosophila Shal counterpart encode proteins that form fast inactivating K+ channels that activate and inactivate at subthreshold potentials and recover from inactivation at a faster rate than other inactivating Kv channels. Taken together, the properties of Kv4 channels compare best with those of low-voltage activating "A-currents" present in the neuronal somatodendritic compartment and widely reported across several types of central and peripheral neurons, as well as the (Ca2+-independent) transient outward potassium conductance of heart cells (Ito). Three distinct genes have been identified that encode mammalian Shal homologs (Kv4. 1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3), of which the latter two are abundant in rat adult brain and heart tissues. The distribution in the adult rat brain of the mRNA transcripts encoding the three known Kv4 subunits was studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Kv4.1 signals are very faint, suggesting that Kv4.1 mRNAs are expressed at very low levels, but Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 transcripts appear to be abundant and each produces a unique pattern of expression. Although there is overlap expression of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 transcripts in several neuronal populations, the dominant feature is one of differential, and sometimes reciprocal expression. For example, Kv4.2 transcripts are the predominant form in the caudate-putamen, pontine nucleus and several nuclei in the medula, whereas the substantia nigra pars compacta, the restrosplenial cortex, the superior colliculus, the raphe, and the amygdala express mainly Kv4.3. Some brain structures contain both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 mRNAs but each dominates in distinct neuronal subpopulations. For example, in the olfactory bulb Kv4.2 dominates in granule cells and Kv4.3 in periglomerular cells. In the hippocampus Kv4.2 is the most abundant isoform in CA1 pyramidal cells, whereas only Kv4.3 is expressed in interneurons. Both are abundant in CA2-CA3 pyramidal cells and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, which also express Kv4.1. In the dorsal thalamus strong Kv4.3 signals are seen in several lateral nuclei, whereas medial nuclei express Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 at moderate to low levels. In the cerebellum Kv4.3, but not Kv4.2, is expressed in Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons. In the cerebellar granule cell layer, the reciprocity between Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 is observed in subregions of the same neuronal population. In fact, the distribution of Kv4 channel transcripts in the cerebellum defines a new pattern of compartmentation of the cerebellar cortex and the first one involving molecules directly involved in signal processing.

TI  - Differential regulation of the human 'leukemia inhibitory factor' (LIF) promoter in T47D and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells.  
AB  - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine. A potential role for LIF in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer was recently indicated by the finding that LIF is produced by MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and that it stimulates proliferation of the T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Despite its role as a possible therapeutic target in breast cancer, the transcriptional regulation of the LIF gene in breast cancer cells has not been investigated so far. In this context, we investigated the regulation of the human LIF promoter (human LIF666-luciferase) by ovarian steroids in transient transfection assays in MDA-MB 231 and T47D cells. Since the MDA-MB 231 cells are devoid of both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, these cells were co-transfected with the respective receptor expression vector. Estradiol induced no stimulation in either T47D or ER-transfected MDA-MB 231 cells. Treatment with the progesterone agonist MPA (medroxy-progesterone acetate) resulted in induction of LIF transcription in PR-transfectant MDA-MB 231 cells, while it had no effect in T47D cells. Both PR isoforms (PR-B and PR-A) were effective in inducing the LIF promoter in MDA-MB 231 cells, and this effect was inhibited by the progestin antagonist RU 486. The stimulatory effect of MPA was maintained on deletion constructs (h274LIF-Luc, h148LIF-Luc and h82LIF-Luc), indicating that 82 bp are sufficient to mediate this effect. Our results indicate that the LIF promoter is transcriptionally active in human breast cancer cells and its activity can be modulated by progestins and anti-progestins in cells expressing the LIF protein, which might have therapeutic implications.

TI  - Characterization of dnaC2 and dnaC28 mutants by flow cytometry.  
AB  - Escherichia coli strains containing thermosensitive dnaC alleles were studied by flow cytometry. Strains containing either the dnaC2 or dnaC28 allele were shifted between different temperatures, and DNA content distributions were gathered. Inhibition of initiation of chromosome replication at nonpermissive temperature, as well as reinitiation of replication at permissive temperature, were found to be affected by a number of parameters. These included the choice of permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, the length of the time of incubation at the nonpermissive temperature, the growth medium, the type of temperature shift used for reinitiation of replication (transient or nontransient), the genetic background of the host cell, and the cell concentration. Reinitiation of replication required neither transcription nor translation, whereas the elongation stage of replication was dependent upon ongoing protein synthesis in the mutants. Efficient use of dnaC mutants for cell cycle studies is discussed.

TI  - Management of hepatitis C.  
AB  - Chronic hepatitis C is a major health care problem throughout the world. The disease may progress to cirrhosis, with complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. The usual primary goal of therapy is viral eradication, as patients with long-term remission are generally regarded as unlikely to develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Another primary goal should be the reduction in liver fibrosis progression. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is the only drug approved for the treatment of hepatitis C in Europe and North America. Its effectiveness appears to be related to dose and duration of therapy. The best efficacy/risk ratio seems to be in favour of 3 million units (MU) IFN-alpha three times per week on a 12-month schedule. With this regimen, a sustained alanine aminotransferase (ALT) response is achieved in nearly 35% of patients. Ribavirin has emerged as potentially the second most effective drug. While it appears unsatisfactory when given alone, it seems much more effective in combination with IFN. Combining them seems to exert a synergistic effect between the two drugs and sustained remission might be achieved in nearly 50% of patients with combination therapy. Controversy persists concerning the long-term benefit of therapy in transient responders and non-responders. It is possible that IFN therapy, in comparison to natural history, might reduce liver fibrosis progression and prevent hepatocellular carcinoma, even in non-responders, and have greater efficacy if used in long-term treatment. Whatever the treatment schedule, prolonged viral eradication may not be achieved in all patients and new drugs should be sought to improve the results of therapy.

TI  - CHOP is implicated in programmed cell death in response to impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum.  
AB  - Cellular stress, particularly in response to toxic and metabolic insults that perturb function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress), is a powerful inducer of the transcription factor CHOP. The role of CHOP in the response of cells to injury associated with ER stress was examined in a murine deficiency model obtained by homologous recombination at the chop gene. Compared with the wild type, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from chop -/- animals exhibited significantly less programmed cell death when challenged with agents that perturb ER function. A similar deficit in programmed cells death in response to ER stress was also observed in MEFs that lack CHOP's major dimerization partner, C/EBPbeta, implicating the CHOP-C/EBP pathway in programmed cell death. An animal model for studying the effects of chop on the response to ER stress was developed. It entailed exposing mice with defined chop genotypes to a single sublethal intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin and resulted in a severe illness characterized by transient renal insufficiency. In chop +/+ and chop +/- mice this was associated with the early expression of CHOP in the proximal tubules followed by the development of a histological picture similar to the human condition known as acute tubular necrosis, a process that resolved by cellular regeneration. In the chop -/- animals, in spite of the severe impairment in renal function, evidence of cellular death in the kidney was reduced compared with the wild type. The proximal tubule epithelium of chop -/- animals exhibited fourfold lower levels of TUNEL-positive cells (a marker for programmed cell death), and significantly less evidence for subsequent regeneration. CHOP therefore has a role in the induction of cell death under conditions associated with malfunction of the ER and may also have a role in cellular regeneration under such circumstances.

TI  - Hyperplastic mesothelial cells in lymph nodes: report of six cases of a benign process that can stimulate metastatic involvement by mesothelioma or carcinoma.  
AB  - We report six cases of hyperplastic mesothelial cells located in the sinuses of lymph nodes. All patients but one had a concurrent serosal fluid collection (two pericardial, two pleural, one abdominal) at the time of the lymph node biopsy. All effusions cleared with treatment of the underlying disorder, which included lymphoproliferative processes, congestive heart failure, and inflammatory diseases (Dressler syndrome, vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis). Four cases were associated with vascular prominence of the involved nodal sinuses, a feature that may reflect the cause of the underlying effusion or support the transient persistence of benign mesothelial cells in lymph nodes. Two cases were characterized by distention of the nodal sinuses by sheets of mitotically active mesothelial cells. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic carcinoma, keratin-positive dendritic cells native to lymph nodes, and metastatic malignant mesothelioma. Because the latter shares both clinical and morphological features with cases of benign mesothelial cells in lymph nodes, we believe that this distinction may not always be possible in a given biopsy specimen and therefore that careful clinical follow-up is required in such cases.

TI  - Lithium increases melanin-concentrating hormone mRNA stability and inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression in PC12 cells.  
AB  - Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide involved in the regulation of food-intake behaviour and stress response in mammals. Expression of the MCH gene predominates in hypothalamic neurons. Mechanisms governing the regulation of expression of MCH gene in established cell lines were not explored yet. Here, we analysed the actions of nerve growth factor (NGF), dexamethasone, forskolin and lithium on MCH mRNA levels in the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line. We compared them with those observed on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA, constitutively expressed in PC12 cells, and neurotensin (NT) mRNA, taken as a control. In untreated cells, MCH RNA species of high molecular weight were found. Exposure of cells at a combination of NGF and lithium resulted in decreased expression of these MCH RNAs and in the transient production of mature MCH mRNA. Strikingly, after short exposure of PC12 cells to NGF, lithium per se elicited a marked increase in MCH mRNA levels whilst it exerted a potent inhibitory action on TH mRNA expression. Detailed investigations revealed that lithium enhanced MCH mRNA expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms whereas it regulated TH gene expression mainly at the level of transcription. These results demonstrate that lithium, an agent widely used for treatment of manic depressive illness, can exert an opposite effect on MCH and TH mRNA production in PC12 cells. The MCH gene system in NGF-treated PC12 cells provides a good opportunity for studying the effect of lithium on gene expression at post-transcriptional levels in a neuron-like cellular model.

TI  - Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors block tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, degradation of IkappaBalpha, nuclear translocation of p65, and subsequent gene expression.  
AB  - Several inflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are known to be mediated through activation of a nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, but how TNF activates NF-kappaB is incompletely understood. In the present report, we examined the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) in TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation by using genistein and erbstatin, two potent inhibitors of PTK. The treatment of human myeloid U-937 cells with either inhibitor completely suppressed the TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Suppression correlated with PTK activity, since among the structural analogues of genistein, only an active inhibitor of PTK, quercetin blocked TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and not daidzein, an inactive inhibitor. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was not limited to myeloid cells, as it was observed with T cells and epithelial cells. Both the PTK inhibitors blocked the degradation of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitory subunit of NF-kappaB, and the consequent translocation of the p65 subunit without any significant effect on p50 or on c-Rel. The PTK inhibitors did not interfere with NF-kappaB binding to DNA. The NF-kappaB-dependent CAT reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays was also suppressed by the PTK inhibitors. Both PTK inhibitors abolished TNF-induced activation of N-terminal c-Jun kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Overall, our results suggest that a genistein- and erbstatin-sensitive PTK is involved in the pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation and gene expression by TNF and thus could be used as a target for development of antiinflammatory drugs.

TI  - The mechanism of Ca2+ release from the SR of permeabilised guinea-pig and rat ureteric smooth muscle.  
AB  - Recent work has indicated that there is a major difference in the Ca2+ store of smooth muscle from rat and guinea-pig ureter; with the rat store being agonist-sensitive but ryanodine insensitive and the guinea-pig store being ryanodine sensitive but agonist insensitive [Th. V. Burdyga, M.J. Taggart, S. Wray, J. Physiol. 489 (1995) 327-335]. We have therefore examined directly the mechanism of Ca2+ release from the internal Ca2+ store (SR). Following permeabilisation with alpha-toxin or beta-escin the SR was Ca(2+)-loaded before application of carbachol or caffeine. Only carbachol evoked a transient contraction in rat ureter. The carbachol-induced contraction was blocked by heparin and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) but not ryanodine. Only caffeine produced contraction in guinea-pig ureter, and this was blocked by ryanodine. Direct application of IP3 caused a small transient contraction in rat but not guinea-pig ureter. We conclude that rat ureter possesses only an IP3 sensitive store while guinea-pig ureter only has a ryanodine sensitive store.

TI  - Comparison of relaxations evoked by photoactivation of NO-containing compounds and nitrergic nerve stimulation in 5-hydroxytryptamine- and potassium-contracted rat gastric fundus.  
AB  - 1. The aim of the present study was to further investigate our earlier proposal of liberation of nitric oxide (NO) by photoactivation of molecules containing NO or NO2, which in turn relaxes gastric smooth muscle, and to determine whether presynaptic- and/or postsynaptic NO-mediated relaxation is affected differently by the degree of membrane depolarization in rat gastric fundus smooth muscle. 2. During contraction of rat gastric fundus with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10 microM), low (K+, 25 mM) and high potassium (K+, 65.4 mM), relaxation responses to nitrergic nerve stimulation, photo-activation of caged NO compounds (streptozotocin [STZ], N omega-nitro-L-arginine-methylacetate [L-NAME], N omega-nitro-D-arginine-methylacetate [D-NAME]), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were compared. 3. Nitrergic nerve (presynaptic) stimulation and photoactivation (postsynaptic) of all caged NO compounds produced rapid, transient and reversible relaxation of 5-HT and low-K(+)-contracted tissues. However, when contractions were induced by high K+, the relaxation induced by nerve stimulation was abolished, whereas relaxations induced by photoactivated NO compounds were significantly (P < 0.01) reduced. 4. The relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP), but not papaverine, was also diminished in high-K(+)-contracted tissues. The magnitude of photoactivated NO-induced relaxation was related to the amount of NO release, light intensity and concentration of compounds. 5. The evidence that photoactivated NO-induced relaxation is mediated by cGMP comes from the observation that zaprinast, but not forskolin, potentiated the relaxation. 6. It is concluded that rat gastric smooth muscle relaxes to photoactivation of NO or NO2-carrying molecules via NO, and it appears that degree of membrane depolarization may be a critical factor in dissociating the response to presynaptic- and postsynaptic NO-mediated relaxation in this muscle.

TI  - A neuronal C5a receptor and an associated apoptotic signal transduction pathway.  
AB  - 1. We report the first experimental evidence of a neuronal C5a receptor (nC5aR) in human cells of neuronal origin. Expression of nC5aR mRNA was demonstrated by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in TGW human neuroblastoma cells. 2. Expression of a functional C5aR was supported by the finding that C5a evoked a transient increase in the intracellular calcium level as measured by flow cytometry (FACS). 3. To analyse the function of the nC5aR, an antisense peptide fragment of the C5aR was used. Previous data showed that a C5aR fragment (a peptide termed PR226) has C5aR agonist and antagonist effects in U-937 cells depending on the concentration of the peptide. We found that a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) form of the same peptide (termed PR226-MAP) induced rapid elevation of nuclear c-fos immunoreactivity and resulted in DNA fragmentation, a characteristic sign of apoptosis, in TGW cells. 4. Early electrophysiological events characteristic of apoptosis were also detected: intermittent calcium current pulses were recorded within 1-2 min of peptide administration. C5a pretreatment delayed the onset of this calcium influx. 5. We also demonstrated that the apoptotic pathway is linked to nC5aR via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. 6. Although the function of C5a and its receptor on neurons is unknown, these results suggest that an abnormal activation of this signal transduction pathway can result in apoptosis and, subsequently, in neurodegeneration.

TI  - Visualization of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase by x-ray crystallography.  
AB  - Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are signal transduction enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues via the formation of a transient cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. The mechanism of hydrolysis of this intermediate has been examined by generating a Gln-262 --> Ala mutant of PTP1B, which allows the accumulation and trapping of the intermediate within a PTP1B crystal. The structure of the intermediate at 2.5-A resolution reveals that a conformationally flexible loop (the WPD loop) is closed over the entrance to the catalytic site, sequestering the phosphocysteine intermediate and catalytic site water molecules and preventing nonspecific phosphoryltransfer reactions to extraneous phosphoryl acceptors. One of the catalytic site water molecules, the likely nucleophile, forms a hydrogen bond to the putative catalytic base, Asp-181. In the wild-type enzyme, the nucleophilic water molecule would be coordinated by the side chain of Gln-262. In combination with our previous structural data, we can now visualize each of the reaction steps of the PTP catalytic pathway. The hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of PTPs is reminiscent of GTP hydrolysis by the GTPases, in that both families of enzymes utilize an invariant Gln residue to coordinate the attacking nucleophilic water molecule.

TI  - The role of an inverted CCAAT element in transcriptional activation of the human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha gene by heat shock.  
AB  - Expression of the DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha) gene is highly sensitive to various environmental stimuli including heat shock. The amount of topoIIalpha mRNA was increased 1.5-3-fold 6-24 h after exposure of T24 human urinary bladder cancer cells to heat shock stress at 43 degreesC for 1 h. The effect of heat shock on the transcriptional activity of the human topoIIalpha gene promoter was investigated by transient transfection of T24 cells with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter sequence. The transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter (nucleotides (nt) -295 to +85) and of three deletion constructs (nt -197 to +85, -154 to +85, and -74 to +85) was increased approximately 3-fold 24 h after heat shock stress. In contrast, the transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter (nt -20 to +85), which lacks the first inverted CCAAT element (ICE1), the GC box, and the heat shock element located between nt -74 and -21, was not increased by heat shock. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of promoter constructs containing mutations in the GC box or heat shock element, but not that of a construct containing mutations in ICE1, was significantly increased by heat shock. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed reduced binding of a nuclear factor to an oligonucleotide containing ICE1 when nuclear extracts were derived from cells cultured for 3-24 h after heat shock. No such change in factor binding was apparent with an oligonucleotide containing the heat shock element of the topoIIalpha gene promoter. Finally, in vivo footprint analysis of the topoIIalpha gene promoter revealed that two G residues of ICE1 that were protected in control cells became sensitive to dimethyl sulfate modification after heat shock. These results suggest that transcriptional activation of the topoIIalpha gene by heat shock requires the release of a negative regulatory factor from ICE1.

TI  - Mechanisms in the transcriptional regulation of bradykinin B1 receptor gene expression. Identification of a minimum cell-type specific enhancer.  
AB  - To investigate the mechanisms of bradykinin B1 (BKB1) receptor gene expression, transient DNA transfection analyses of human BKB1 receptor gene promoter were performed in SV-40 transformed IMR90 cells. A positive regulatory element (PRE) located at position -604 to -448 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription start site consistently exhibited, by far, the highest level of relative luciferase activity. A negative regulatory element, at position -682 to -604 bp, was able to completely ablate the function of the PRE. Transfection combined with deletion and mutation analyses illustrated that the PRE contains a classic, powerful enhancer. This enhancer was minimized to a 100-bp element at position -548 to -448 bp. A 78-bp fragment of negative regulatory element functioned as a silencer.  Transient transfection of the enhancer construct, driven by heterologous herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, into a variety of cell types, showed that this enhancer presents a cell-type specific feature. In the characterization of the enhancer, motifs A (-548 to -532) and B (-483 to -477) were found to be essential for full enhancer activity. Motif D (-472 to -467) played a smaller role in enhancer activation. Gel shift and antibody supershift assays determined that an AP-1 factor binds with motif B. The nuclear protein which binds to motif A has yet to be identified. Both factors are the critical regulators for this enhancer activation.

TI  - Otoacoustic emission and auditory efferent function testing in patients with sensori-neural hearing loss.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of otoacoustic emissions and auditory efferent system function in evaluating auditory functional status in both normal and diseased conditions. METHODS: Spontaneous and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and efferent function in terms of contralateral white noise induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppressions were tested and cross compared in 32 normal ears, 24 ears with cochlear hearing loss and 16 ears with retrocochlear hearing loss. RESULTS: Transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude and contralateral suppression, spontaneous otoacoustic emission incidence, peaks and frequency range were significantly reduced in cochlear hearing loss while in retrocochlear hearing loss transient evoked otoacoustic emission and spontaneous otoacoustic emission levels were significantly higher than in cochlear hearing loss group and showed no suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral acoustic stimulation induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppression as an index of efferent function is clinically feasible. Combined otoacoustic emission and efferent tests are of great significance in evaluating cochlea status and auditory central mechanisms. Auditory efferent function is weakened in cochlear lesions and severely damaged in retrocochlear lesions.

TI  - Autologous human collagen and dermal fibroblasts for soft tissue augmentation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Augmentation of soft tissue defects can be achieved through intradermal injection of silicone, animal collagen, plasma-gelatin mixture, and fat. Due to their rapid degradation in vivo, however, clinical effects are typically transient. The use of autologous human collagen could conceivably result in sustained clinical improvement due to decreased collagen degradation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether prolonged dermal correction could be achieved through injection of autologous human fibroblasts. RESULTS: Significant sustained clinical improvement was observed in two of the original 12 patients entered into the study. The nasolabial fold region was shown to be the most responsive facial area to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of injectable autologous human collagen for soft tissue correction remains an intriguing prospect. While the findings of this study indicate possible sustained clinical improvement using this autologous system in some patients, it remains difficult to predict the degree and duration of individual response in various areas.

TI  - Importance of chronopharmacokinetics in design and evaluation of transdermal drug delivery systems.  
AB  - Circadian and meal effects on nicotine kinetics determine in part blood nicotine concentrations and in doing so may influence cigarette smoking behavior throughout the day. We have shown previously that nicotine clearance varies by approximately 17% (from peak to through) due to diurnal factors throughout the day and that meals increase nicotine clearance by about 42%. Until now pharmacokinetic analyses of nicotine absorption from patches have assumed a constant clearance of nicotine over 24 hr. Using 11 individual kinetic estimates from a previous study, we analyzed plasma nicotine concentrations vs. time data of two nicotine patch studies, and conducted a set of simulations to determine the extent to which time-varying kinetics would influence the design of transdermal drug delivery systems, intented to maintain a constant plasma nicotine concentration over 24 hr. Not incorporating time-varying kinetics leads to biased estimates of the delivery rate of the nicotine patches, and increases the variability in the delivery rates estimates. The hypothetical transdermal drug delivery systems designed assuming constant nicotine clearance results in a systematical underdosing during the first 12 hr after beginning therapy. The transdermal drug delivery systems obtained assuming the correct time-varying clearance shows three components: 1) an early high delivery rate, followed by 2) a rather constant, but slightly decreasing at night, release rate and 3) transient increases in delivery rate for 2 hr after each meal. The effect of circadian variations in clearance could be compensated for in patch design by decreasing the delivery rate during the night.  Transient variations in clearance due to meals would require the corresponding use of rapid drug delivery dosage forms. The methods we devise to predict optimal dosing regimens in presence of chronopharmacokinetics might be useful for other medications in which blood levels need to be precisely controlled.

TI  - Effects of three sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ pump inhibitors on release channels of intracellular stores.  
AB  - The three principal sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ pump inhibitors have been compared for their effects on Ca++ fluxes across intracellular stores present in isolated skeletal muscle and brain membrane preparations. At moderate concentrations that only partially inhibited Ca++ pumping, all three inhibitors induced transient release of Ca++ from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, and release was ruthenium red-sensitive, much faster and sustained at higher pump inhibitor concentrations. In contrast, in unidirectional 45Ca efflux assays, cyclopiazonic acid appeared to have little effect, thapsigargin decreased efflux and 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone increased efflux only slightly. These observations taken together suggest that transient releases were manifest primarily by vesicles with a high ratio of ryanodine receptors to pumps (and thus more susceptible to becoming leaky with only some pumps inhibited), and that Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release amplified releases when all pumps were blocked. These mostly indirect side effects were specific for ryanodine receptors. In similar experiments with brain cerebellar membranes, none of the three inhibitors appeared to directly reduce release induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These findings may affect interpretation of results of experiments involving application of these compounds to isolated membranes, cells or tissue preparations.

TI  - Artificial ureteral replacement for ureteral necrosis after renal transplantation: report of 3 cases.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We applied a new minimally invasive technique of artificial ureteral replacement for renal transplant ureteral necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Artificial ureteral replacement was performed in 3 renal transplant recipients with ureteral necrosis (complete in 1 and distal in 2) after failure of primary endoscopic treatment. Under fluoroscopic guidance a percutaneous tract is created and progressively dilated. The ureteral silicone polytetrafluoroethylene bonded tube is introduced into the pyelocaliceal renal graft cavities, tracked subcutaneously down to the suprapubic area and introduced into the bladder via a short incision. RESULTS: There were no immediate postoperative complications except for transient postoperative acute prostatitis in 1 patient. No secondary complications were observed with a mean followup of 2.5 years. All grafts have good late function and all tubes are patent with no evidence of encrustation or obstruction. The tubes are well tolerated underneath the skin. Reflux was present in all 3 cases with no clinical manifestation. An asymptomatic episode of lower urinary tract infection was observed in the female patient. CONCLUSIONS: In select cases of ureteral necrosis after renal transplantation artificial ureteral replacement by subcutaneous pyelovesical bypass offers a possible alternative to open ureteral reconstruction.

TI  - Effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF) on haemodynamics and permselectivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vascular permeability factor (VPF) is a selective mitogen for endothelial cells; it increases microvascular permeability and has been shown to relax isolated canine coronary arteries by an endothelium-dependent mechanism. In many tissues VEGF/VPF is expressed after an appropriate stimulus, mostly hypoxia. In the kidney VEGF/VPF is constitutively expressed in glomerular podocytes and epithelia of collecting duct. Glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelia also constitutively express specific VEGF receptors. The in vivo function of renal VEGF/VPF is unknown. METHOD: In the present study the effects of human recombinant VEGF165 on renal haemodynamics and glomerular permselectivity was investigated in the isolated perfused kidney of the rat. RESULTS: In kidneys preconstricted by noradrenaline (NA 1.5 x 10(-7) mol/l) VEGF/VPF (155 pmol/l) caused an almost complete return of renal perfusion flow rate to pre-NA values (before NA 113 +/- 4%, after NA 100%, 15 min with VEGF/VPF 111 +/- 4%). Shortly after VEGF/VPF administration VEGF/VPF-induced relaxation commenced, and became significant after 2 min (15 min with VEGF/VPF vs without VEGF/VPF 111 +/- 4% vs 103 +/- 2%; P<0.05). In the presence of the NO-synthase inhibitor N(W)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 5 x 10(-5) mol/l) VEGF/VPF caused only small, transient relaxations (before NNA 109 +/- 5%, after NNA 100%, 15 min with VEGF 95 +/- 2%). The cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac failed to inhibit the relaxing activity of VEGF/VPF (before NA 119 +/- 4%, after NA + diclofenac 100%, 15 min with VEGF/VPF 123 +/- 5%). VEGF demonstrated no significant increase in renal protein excretion rate (after NA pretreatment (= 100%): 12.5 min with VEGF/VPF vs without VEGF/VPF: 119 +/- 10% vs 132 +/- 11%, n.s.) (after NNA pretreatment (= 100%) 12.5 min with VEGF/VPF vs without VEGF/VPF 94 +/- 5% vs 96 +/- 4%; n.s.) or clearance quotient of albumin. Glomerular filtration rate was not influenced by VEGF/VPF in kidneys pretreated with NA (before NA 105 +/- 5%, after NA 100%, 12.5 min with VEGF/VPF 94 +/- 2%) or with NNA (before NNA 107 +/- 6%, after NNA 100%, 12.5 min with VEGF/VPF 96 +/- 2%). Fractional glucose and fractional sodium excretion showed flow-dependent changes. CONCLUSION: VEGF/VPF can contribute to the relaxing capacity of the renal vasculature. This relaxation is partly mediated by the NO/endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) pathway. In the isolated perfused rat kidney the glomerular permeability for albumin is not affected by VEGF/VPF.

TI  - MyoD and MEF2A mediate activation and repression of the p75NGFR gene during muscle development.  
AB  - In an effort to clarify transient expression of the NGF low-affinity receptor p75NGFR during muscle development we have focused on the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and cessation of p75NGFR gene expression. Using quiescent C3H10T1/2 fibroblast as a tool, we observed that induction of differentiation competence in MyoD-transfected 10T1/2 fibroblasts was accompanied by the initiation of p75NGFR expression. Moreover, we could show that the bHLH transcription factor MyoD itself is a powerful candidate for transcriptional activation of the p75NGFR gene in muscle precursor cells. By means of MyoD-mutants we have found that both the amino terminus of the MyoD molecule as well as the bHLH-region are essential for transcriptional activity on the p75NGFR promoter. The fact that myocyte enhancer factor MEF2A inactivated MyoD-induced p75NGFR promoter activity strongly suggests that cell-specific regulation of the p75NGFR gene might be strictly dependent on the intracellular composition and balance of the appropriate bHLH-transcription factors and their modulators.

TI  - Relationship between the increase in Ca2+ transient and contractile force induced by angiotensin II in aequorin-loaded rabbit ventricular myocardium.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pieces of evidence have been accumulating that imply a crucial role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in initiation and progress of heart failure, but the signalling processes subsequent to Ang II receptor activation in cardiac myocytes are complex and still controversial. We examined the effects of Ang II on the relationship between the intracellular Ca2+ transient and isometric contraction in mammalian ventricular myocardium. METHODS: Isolated rabbit ventricular papillary muscle was loaded with the Ca2+ sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin and electrically stimulated at a rate of 0.5 Hz at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Ang II (10(-8)-10(-6) M), in the presence of bupranolol (3 x 10(-7) M) and prazosin (10(-7) M), elicited a positive inotropic effect (PIE) in association with an increase in the peak Ca2+ transient. The maximal PIE of Ang II was about 30% of the isoproterenol-induced maximum (ISOmax), while the maximal increase in the peak Ca2+ transient induced by Ang II was only 7% of ISOmax. Ang II tended to prolong the duration of contraction (both time to peak force and relaxation time) but did not produce a discernible change in the duration of Ca2+ transient. The relationship between the amplitude of Ca2+ transient and peak force was shifted to the left by Ang II, as compared with the relationship for elevation of [Ca2+]o (2.5-15.0 mM). The PIE and the increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transient induced by Ang II were abolished by a selective angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan (10(-5) M) but were not affected by a selective AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (10(-6) M). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Ang II elicits a PIE through a dual mechanism via activation of AT1 receptors in rabbit ventricular myocardium: by an increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transient; and in addition by an increase in the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.

TI  - Transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in the early stages of apoptosis.  
AB  - A transient burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins occurs early, prior to commitment to death, in human osteosarcoma cells undergoing apoptosis, followed by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The generality of this early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has now been investigated with human HL-60 cells, mouse 3T3-L1, and immortalized fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice. The effects of eliminating this early transient modification of nuclear proteins by depletion of PARP protein either by antisense RNA expression or by gene disruption on various morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis were then examined. Marked caspase-3-like PARP cleavage activity, proteolytic processing of CPP32 to its active form, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and nuclear morphological changes associated with apoptosis were induced in control 3T3-L1 cells treated for 24 h with anti-Fas and cycloheximide but not in PARP-depleted 3T3-L1 antisense cells exposed to these inducers. Similar results were obtained with control and PARP-depleted human Jurkat T cells. Whereas immortalized PARP +/+ fibroblasts showed the early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and a rapid apoptotic response when exposed to anti-Fas and cycloheximide, PARP -/- fibroblasts exhibited neither the early poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation nor any of the biochemical or morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis when similarly treated. Stable transfection of PARP -/- fibroblasts with wild-type PARP rendered the cells sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that PARP and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may trigger key steps in the apoptotic program. Subsequent degradation of PARP by caspase-3-like proteases may prevent depletion of NAD and ATP or release certain nuclear proteins from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-induced inhibition, both of which might be required for late stages of apoptosis.

TI  - Effect of combined transient androgen deprivation and irradiation following radical prostatectomy for prostatic cancer.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether transient androgen deprivation improves outcome in patients irradiated after radical prostatectomy for locally advanced disease, persistent or rising postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), or local recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Records of 105 consecutive patients who were treated with pelvic irradiation after radical retropubic prostatectomy between August 1985 and December 1995 were reviewed. Seventy-four patients received radiation alone (mean follow up: 4.6 years), and 31 received transient androgen blockade with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (4) androgen receptor blocker (1) or both (24) beginning 2 months prior to irradiation (mean follow-up 3.0 years) for a mean duration of 6 months. Two of these patients were excluded from further analysis because they received hormonal therapy for more than 1 year. Patients received a prostatic fossa dose of 60-70 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction; 48 patients also received pelvic nodal irradiation to a median dose of 50 Gy. Survival, freedom from clinical relapse (FFCR), and freedom from biochemical relapse (FFBR) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Biochemical relapse was defined as two consecutive PSA measurements exceeding 0.07 ng/ml. RESULTS: At 5 years after irradiation, actuarial survival for all patients was 92%, FFCR was 77%, and FFBR was 34%. FFBR was significantly better among patients who received transient androgen blockade before and during radiotherapy than among those treated with radiation alone (56 vs. 27% at 5 years, p = 0.004). FFCR was also superior for the combined treatment group (100 vs. 70% at 5 years, p = 0.014). Potential clinical prognostic factors before irradiation did not differ significantly between treatment groups, including tumor stage, summed Gleason histologic score, lymph node status, indication for treatment, and PSA levels before surgery or subsequent treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that transient androgen deprivation was the only significant predictor for biochemical failure. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study of irradiation after radical prostatectomy suggests that transient androgen blockade and irradiation may improve freedom from early biochemical and clinically evident relapse compared to radiotherapy alone, although more prolonged follow-up will be needed to assess durability of impact upon clinical recurrence and survival rates.

TI  - Voltage-clamp analysis and computer simulation of a novel cesium-resistant A-current in guinea pig laterodorsal tegmental neurons.  
AB  - Increased firing of cholinergic neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) plays a critical role in generating the behavioral states of arousal and rapid eye movement sleep. The majority of these neurons exhibit a prominent transient potassium current (IA) that shapes firing but the properties of which have not been examined in detail. Although IA has been reported to be blocked by intracellular cesium, the IA in LDT neurons appeared resistant to intracellular cesium. The present study compared the properties of this cesium-resistant current to those typically ascribed to IA. Whole cell recordings were obtained from LDT neurons (n = 67) in brain slices with potassium- or cesium-containing pipette solutions. A transient current was observed in cells dialyzed with each solution (KGluc-85%; CsGluc-79%). However, in cesium-dialyzed neurons, the transient current was inward at test potentials negative to about -35 mV. Extracellular 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 2-5 mM) blocked both inward and outward current, suggesting the inward current was reversed IA rather than an unmasked transient calcium current as previously suggested. This conclusion was supported by increasing [K]o from 5 to 15 mM, which shifted the reversal potential positively for both inward and outward current (+17.89 +/- 0.41 mV; mean +/- SE). Moreover, recovery from inactivation was rapid (tau = 15.5 +/- 4 ms; n = 4), as reported for IA, and both inward and outward transient current persisted in calcium-free solution [0 calcium/4 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N', N'-tetraacetic acid; n = 4] and during cadmium-blockade of calcium currents (n = 3). Finally, the transient current was blocked by intracellular 4-AP indicating that adequate dialysis occurred during the recordings. Thus the Cs-resistant current is a subthreshold IA. We also estimated the voltage-dependence of activation (V1/2 = -45.8 +/- 2 mV, k = 5.21 +/- 0.62 mV, n = 6) and inactivation (V1/2 = -59. 0 +/- 2.38 mV, k = -5.4 +/- 0.49 mV, n = 3) of this current. Computer simulations using a morphologically accurate model cell indicated that except for the extreme case of only distal A-channels and a high intracellular resistivity, our parameter estimates were good approximations. In conclusion, guinea pig LDT neurons express subthreshold A-channels that are resistant to intracellular cesium ions. This suggests that these channels differ fundamentally in their ion permeation mechanism from those previously studied. It remains to be determined if Cs+ resistance is common among brain A-channels or if this property is conferred by known A-channel subunits.

TI  - Effects of epidermal growth factor on the invasion activity of the bladder cancer cell line.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is excreted in high concentrations in the urine and stimulates urothelial cell growth. The cultured bladder cancer cell line KU-1 was used to study the molecular mechanisms by which EGF affects urothelial tumor growth and invasion activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KU-1 cells were grown in cell culture in the presence or absence of EGF. Anchorage-independent cell growth assays and Matrigel invasion assays were performed. Expression of cytokeratins was examined by Northern and Western blot analyses. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were used to determine whether EGF stimulated matrix metalloproteinase expression. RESULTS: EGF enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and increased the number of cells penetrating into a Matrigel membrane.  A transient transfection assay revealed that EGF increased the promoter activities of the matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 9 genes in KU-1 cells. Moreover, the morphology of KU-1 cells changed after the addition of EGF to the culture medium. Western and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that EGF decreased cytokeratin 19 expression, but did not affect expression of cytokeratin 8 or 18. CONCLUSION: EGF increased the invasive activity of KU-1 bladder cancer cells in part by increasing the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Morphologic changes may result from altered composition of cytoskeletal proteins.

TI  -  Transient kinetics and thermodynamics of anthroylouabain binding to Na/K-ATPase.  
AB  - The Na/K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein enzyme which uses energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP to pump Na+ out of and K+ into the cell. Ouabain belongs to a class of drugs known as cardiac glycosides, which are useful for treating congestive heart failure. Therapeutic value is achieved when these drugs bind to and inhibit the Na/K-ATPase of cardiac muscle. We gain insight into this important interaction by measuring the thermodynamics of the interaction of anthroylouabain (AO), a fluorescent derivative of ouabain, with the Na/K-ATPase. AO has the useful property that its fluorescence intensity is greatly enhanced (approximately 10x) when it binds to the enzyme. Using this enhancement, we measure temperature dependence of transient kinetics for the association and dissociation of AO interacting with membrane fragments of Na/K-ATPase purified from dog kidney. Using a standard Eyring analysis, we find that the overall association of AO with the enzyme is driven by substantial contributions from both enthalpy and entropy, and that in an energy diagram for the association pathway, the free energy change is quite similar to that of ouabain deduced from previously published results [E. Erdmann, W. Schoner, BBA 307 (1973) 386]. However, in the transition state, there are substantial differences for the enthalpy and entropy, presumably due to the presence of the anthracene moiety.

TI  - BDNF-GFP containing secretory granules are localized in the vicinity of synaptic junctions of cultured cortical neurons.  
AB  - The protein family of mammalian neurotrophins, comprising nerve-growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 and -4/5 (NT-3, NT-4/5), supports the survival and the phenotype of neurons from the central as well as the peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS). In addition, exogenous application of neurotrophins has recently been found to modulate synaptic transmission in the rodent CNS. However, to provide evidence for a role of neurotophins as endogenous fast acting modulators of synaptic transmission, the synaptic localization and secretion of neurotrophins needs to be shown. We have now constructed a fusion protein consisting of N-terminal BDNF (the most abundant neurotrophin in the rodent hippocampus and neocortex) and C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) to elucidate the cellular localization of BDNF in cortical neurons.  Transient expression of BDNF-GFP in COS-7 cells revealed that the cellular localization in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the processing of precursor proteins and the secretion of mature BDNF-GFP is indistinguishable from the properties of untagged BDNF. Upon transient transfection of primary rat cortical neurons, BDNF-GFP was found in secretory granules of the regulated pathway of secretion, as indicated by colocalization with the secretory granule marker secretogranin II. BDNF-GFP vesicles were found in the neurites of transfected neurons with a pattern reminiscent of the localization of endogenous BDNF in untransfected cortical neurons. BDNF-GFP vesicles were found predominantly in the somatodendritic compartment of the neurons, whereas additional axonal localization was found less frequently. Immunocytochemical staining of synaptic terminals with synapsin I antibodies revealed that the density of BDNF-GFP vesicles is elevated in the vicinity of synaptic junctions, indicating that BDNF is localized appropriately to function as an acute modulator of synaptic transmission. These data suggest that BDNF-GFP will be a useful tool to investigate synaptic release of BDNF during physiological synaptic stimulation, and will thereby allow us to elucidate the participation of neurotrophin release in activity dependent synaptic plasticity.

TI  - Clinical experience with cryosurgery for advanced hepatobiliary tumors.  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There have been reports that suggest cryosurgical techniques may be a useful adjunct to surgical resection or even a viable alternative treatment for hepatobiliary malignancies. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical results following cryoablation in conjunction with surgical resection for advanced hepatic tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive procedures in 31 patients with advanced liver tumors treated with cryosurgical ablation were evaluated. Cryosurgery was applied: (1) to achieve a > 1-cm tumor-free margin when standard surgical margins were close (2) with or without standard surgical resection to manage multiple tumors (3) with hepatic arterial portocath placement to increase tumor response. Cryoablation was applied to 47 of 105 lesions--independently in 4 patients and in combination with hepatic resection in 28 procedures. RESULTS: Cryoablation was used in 11 procedures because of close surgical margins. In 21 operations cryosurgery was used for primary ablation. In 17 of these 21 patients both cryosurgery and resection were used for different lesions; in 4 cryosurgery alone was used.  Transient changes in hepatic enzymes, PT, PTT, and platelets were at maximum on Postoperative Days 1-3. Surgical mortality and morbidity rates were 6 and 60%, respectively. Coagulation abnormalities were common: at least 30% reduction in platelets occurred in all patients and greater than a 50% reduction occurred in 19 of 32 (59%). Twenty patients had a PT > 15 s and 6 of these 20 also had a platelet count < 50,000. Associated complications included one wound hematoma, two GI hemorrhages, one intracranial hemorrhage, and one hepatic hemorrhage from the cryosurgical site. The actuarial patient survivals were 90, 59, 33, and 22% at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This report helps define the risks and results of cryosurgical ablation as a complement to surgical resection for advanced hepatobiliary tumors. Management of lesions contiguous to major blood vessels may include either the Pringle maneuver or total vascular isolation. Since these procedures can have significant morbidity, we urge cautious application of cryosurgery for advanced hepatobiliary tumors in selected otherwise unresectable patients.

TI  - Ipsilateral neglect during intracarotid amobarbital test.  
AB  - Neglect usually occurs in the space contralateral to brain injury. Recent studies describe ipsilateral neglect (IN) whereby patients with right hemisphere injury misbisect lines to the left of midpoint. IN usually develops after contralateral neglect (CN) resolves. We observed whether IN occurs during intracarotid amobarbital infusion. After clinical testing but before resolution of barbiturate effect, 20 right-handed subjects bisected lines until baseline performance returned. More than half (12 of 20) showed transient CN. IN occurred in 40% (8 of 20) of patients, always during the recovery stage of anesthesia, and most frequently followed initial CN.

TI  - Antibodies affecting ion channel function in acquired neuromyotonia, in seropositive and seronegative myasthenia gravis, and in antibody-mediated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.  
AB  - A new autoimmune disease affecting the neuromuscular junction has been defined. Acquired neuromyotonia is associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels that act, at least in part, by reducing potassium channel function with resulting neuronal hyperactivity. This condition is quite frequently associated with thymoma and, in many cases, antibodies to acetylcholine receptors are present as well as antibodies to VGKC. Improvements in techniques and the availability of cloned DNA and recombinant forms of the AChR subunits have led to new observations concerning the specificity and roles of antibodies in myasthenia gravis. The transfection of a cell line with the epsilon subunit means that we can now accurately compare antibodies reactive with adult and fetal human AChR. This may help to determine the relationship between AChR subunit expression in different tissues and the induction of antibodies that bind specifically to the two forms, as well as to clarify the role of antibodies to fetal or adult AChR in causing ocular muscle symptoms. Serum antibodies from a few mothers with obstetric histories of recurrent arthrogryposis multiplex congenita in their babies specifically inhibit the function of fetal AChR. These observations not only explain the cause of some cases of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, but also suggest that other fetal-specific antibodies might be responsible for other fetal or neonatal conditions. An animal model has been established to enable us to investigate the role of maternal serum factors in causing such disorders. Seronegative MG has been the subject of many studies from our laboratory over the last ten years.  The transience of the effects of SNMG plasmas on AChR function strongly suggests that the plasma antibodies do not bind directly to the AChR, but inhibit function by some indirect mechanism. They do not appear to act via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, and studies are in progress to investigate the involvement of other second messenger systems.

TI  - Disturbances in hormonal profiles of night workers during their usual sleep and work times.  
AB  - In a previous study, the authors reported that the 24-h rhythms of pituitary and adrenal hormones--that is, thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL), growth hormone, and cortisol--adapted only partially in a group of permanent night workers. However, the real impact of circadian rhythm alterations on the health and well-being of subjects is still unclear. In this study, the authors focus on an ergonomic field and address questions of adaptation of these hormones during the usual day sleep time (0700-1500 h) and during the usual night work time (2200-0600 h) in permanent night workers. Eleven night workers, working a night schedule for at least 2 years, submitted to a high-frequency blood sampling procedure (10 min) and to electroencephalographic recordings during sleep. The endocrine profiles of night workers were compared to those of day-active subjects studied during their usual sleep-wake schedule. During usual day sleep, despite an adapted sleep structure, cortisol levels among night workers were abnormally enhanced, whereas the TSH decreased in comparison to the plateau observed among day-active subjects. During usual work time, some hormonal disturbances persisted, in particular concerning cortisol and PRL (two hormones known to reflect the level of activation). Among night workers, the work time was associated with the quiescent period of cortisol secretion normally occurring during the first hours of sleep, and with a transient PRL increase. These results revealed altered hormonal profiles during the sleep time of night workers that do not result in an altered sleep pattern. The nocturnal work time, which requires a high level physical and mental performance, is associated with some endocrine alterations reflecting an eventual phase of hypovigilance.

TI  - Circadian rhythms, athletic performance, and jet lag.  
AB  - Rapid air travel across several time zones exposes the traveller to a shift in his/her internal biological clock. The result is a transient desynchronisation of the circadian rhythm, called jet lag, lasting until the rhythm is rephased to the new environmental conditions. The most commonly experienced symptoms are sleep disorders, difficulties with concentrating, irritability, depression, fatigue, disorientation, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Apart from the decrements in mental and physical performance directly consequent on such symptoms, competitive athletes are also exposed to the additional negative consequences of a shift from the optimal circadian window of performance. A brief summary of the possible negative effects of jet lag on athletic performance and potentially alleviating strategies is given.

TI  - Toxicology and humoral immunity assessment of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) following a 1-month whole body inhalation exposure in Fischer 344 rats.  
AB  - D5 is a low-molecular-weight cyclic siloxane used for industrial and consumer product applications. The objective of the present study was to assess potential toxic and immunomodulatory consequences of inhalation exposure to D5. Male and female Fischer 344 rats (25/group) were exposed by whole body inhalation to 0, 10, 25, 75, or 160 ppm D5 6 h/day, 7 days/week for 28 days. Clinical signs, body weights, and food consumption were recorded. On the day following the final exposure, 10 rats/group/sex were euthanized and a complete necropsy performed. Following a 14-day nonexposure recovery period, the remaining 5 rats/sex/group were necropsied. Body and organ weights were obtained and a complete set of tissues was taken for histopathology. Samples were also collected for serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis. Immunotoxicology-designated rats (10/sex/group) were immunized with sheep erythrocytes (sRBC) 4 days prior to euthanasia and cyclophosphamide (CYP) was administered i.p. to positive controls on days 24 through 28. The anti-sRBC antibody-forming cell (AFC) response was evaluated in a standard plaque assay. Blood was also collected for examination in the anti-sRBC enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). D5 exposure did not modulate humoral immunity, while the internal control, CYP, produced the expected suppression of the AFC response. D5 exposure caused no adverse effects on body weight, food consumption, or urinalysis parameters. Serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) was significantly decreased in females at terminal (12%, 160 ppm) and recovery sacrifice. A significant increase in the liver-to-body weight ratio was observed in female animals at the end of exposures (13%, 160 ppm), but was not noted in recovery animals from the same exposure group. In males, significant increases in liver-to-body weight (5%) and thymus-to-body weight (14%) ratios were also noted at the high dose at terminal sacrifice and were not present at recovery. At recovery only, a significant increase in spleen-to-body weight ratios (14 and 17%; 25 and 160 ppm, respectively) was noted. At the end of exposure, histopathological analysis indicated an increased incidence and severity of nasal (Level 1) goblet cell proliferation. Focal macrophage accumulation in the lung was also observed to be increased in incidence in both sexes at 160 ppm. At the end of the recovery period, the effects in both of these organs appeared to be reversible. In summary, D5 inhalation exposure did not alter humoral immunity and caused only minor, transient changes in hematological, serum chemistry, and organ weight values. Histopathological changes were confined to the respiratory tract and appeared to be reversible. The no observed effect level for systemic toxicity, based primarily on the liver weight changes, was 75 ppm.

TI  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in cystic fibrosis: incidence and prevalence.  
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) was recovered from 211 of 773 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients followed for at least one year, and seen between 1982 and 1994. Yearly prevalence (5.6% to 8.7%) and incidence rates (1.6% to 5.7%) showed no trends. SM persistence varied greatly and was unlike that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifty percent of SM-positive patients had only one positive culture and only 24 (11%) remained chronically infected. Although SM-positive patients were more likely to be hospitalized than SM-negative patients, for 55% of SM-positive patients, acquisition did not appear to follow hospitalization. Of 40 SM-positive patients who had a CF sibling, only 10 siblings were ever culture positive. When stratified by FEV1, the two-year survival for SM-positive with mild/moderate disease (98%) and severe disease (78%) was similar to that of our SM-negative patients. Five-year survival was only 40% for SM-positive patients with initially severe pulmonary status, compared with 72% for the SM-negative patients. Seventy percent of the original SM isolates were panresistant (susceptible to no more than one antimicrobial agent). Ten years later, panresistance was 84%. Despite our reassuring experience with SM, including lack of sibling concordance, the fact that the majority of our patients had no hospital exposure prior to acquisition, the high incidence of transient infection, and the seemingly unaffected two-year survival, there are insufficient data to definitively conclude that segregation of these patients would be beneficial. The increasing prevalence of multiply resistant gram-negative pathogens in CF patients suggests the need for continued caution with any panresistant pathogen.

TI  - Cardiac actions of taurine as a modulator of the ion channels.  
AB  - During ischemia, hypoxia and cardiac failure, the heart undergoes several adverse changes, including a reduction in taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid). Oral administration of taurine under these disease conditions would be expected to act like a mild cardiac glycoside. Taurine would exert improvement in the accumulation of [Na]i and the loss of alpha-amino acids. Nonetheless, when intracellular taurine content is raised, there would be the benefit of increased Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile proteins, as well as possible changes in the action potential associated with the actions of taurine on ion channels. In fact, intracellular application of taurine produces the opposite actions to extracellularly administration of the amino acid. From our previous experiments, the electrophysiological actions of taurine on cardiac muscle cells include the following. (a) Prolongation of action potential duration (APD) at high [Ca]i and shortening of APD at low [Ca]i. In multicellular preparations, however, taurine did not always prevent [Ca]o-induced effects. (b) Stimulation of spontaneous activity at low intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca]i and [Ca]o), and vice versa. (c) Inhibition of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa(L)) at high [Ca]i, and vice versa. (d) Enhancement of the T-type Ca2+ current (ICa(T)). (e) Inhibition of fast Na+ current (INa). (f) Enhancement of TTX-insensitive slow Na+ current. (g) Inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ current (IKrec) at high [Ca]i, and vice versa. (h) Enhancement of the transient outward current (Ito). (i) Inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K+ current (IK(ATP)). Since taurine acts on so many ion channels and transporters, it is clearly non-specific. Although it is very difficult to understand the diversity of taurine's actions, it is possible that taurine can exert its potent cardioprotective actions under the conditions of low [Ca]i, as well as Ca2+ overload. Thus, although taurine-induced modulation of ion channels located on the cardiac cell membrane is complex, the multiple effects may combine to yield useful therapeutic results.

TI  - Involvement of Ets, rel and Sp1-like proteins in lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR in macrophages.  
AB  - The HIV-1 promoter was used as a model to identify transcription factors involved in LPS-dependent transcription in RAW 264 murine macrophages. Expression plasmids for Ets-2 and PU.1 trans-activated the HIV-1 LTR and recombinant PU.1 and an Ets-2 DNA binding domain/GST fusion protein bound to the 5' kappa B site of the HIV-1 enhancer. Ets-2 mRNA was LPS-inducible in RAW 264 cells and LPS stimulated phosphorylation of threonine 72 residue within the Ets-2 pointed domain. Induction of Ets-2 and other LPS-responsive transcription factors was also observed upon addition of plasmid DNA, which complicates interpretation of transient transfections. The proximal promoter region, containing two Sp1 sites, was also LPS-responsive. We propose that the kappa B elements and the tandem Sp1 sites act as LPS response elements and that kappa B-mediated LPS action involves Ets and rel factors.

TI  - Susceptibility and resistance to Leishmania amazonensis in H-2q syngeneic high and low antibody responder mice (Biozzi mice).  
AB  - H-2 syngeneic H and L (Biozzi) mice provide a model to study Leishmania infections in which polar resistant and susceptible phenotypes are independent from H-2 differences. High-Ab-responder (H) and low-Ab-responder (L) mice syngeneic at the H-2 locus (H-2q) were, respectively, susceptible and highly resistant to Leishmania amazonensis infection. L-mice resistance was associated with high IFN-gamma and transient IL-4 production by lymph node (LN) cells, in contrast with sustained IL-4 and decreasing IFN-gamma production by susceptible H mice. IL-12 production could be detected only in LN from resistant mice. The cytokine production pattern was consistent with preferential progression to a Th1-type response in resistant L-mice, and to a Th2-type response in susceptible H-mice. We also investigated whether this shift towards Th1- or Th2-type cytokine responses was dependent upon H or L antigen presenting cells' (APC) intrinsic ability to preferentially stimulate either T-cell subset. To this end, LN-derived T-cell lines were grown from 12-day infected mice, when both strains produced IFN-gamma and IL-4. L-derived T-cell lines developed a Th2 cytokine pattern whereas H-derived T-cell lines produced IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 whatever the APC origin (H or L) used for their derivation. This work constitutes the first characterization of cellular immune responses to the intracellular parasite, L. amazonensis in H-2 syngeneic mice, an infection model in which polar resistant and susceptible phenotypes are determined by non-MHC genes.

TI  - Rapid onset of ulnar nerve dysfunction during transient occlusion of the brachial artery.  
AB  - Perioperative ulnar neuropathy is a complication that occurs even in patients who seem to be appropriately padded and positioned. The disproportionately high incidence of postoperative ulnar nerve injury compared with the median and radial nerves has largely been attributed to its vulnerability to compression or stretch at the cubital tunnel. Some clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that compromise of perfusion to the upper extremity may also play a role in this complication. To determine whether the ulnar nerve is more sensitive to ischemia of the upper extremity, we studied 10 men during general anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves were simultaneously recorded during general anesthesia with the brachial artery occluded proximal to the cubital fossa. All three nerves showed rapid changes in signal amplitude in response to occlusion of the brachial artery, but the amplitude of the ulnar nerve was affected earlier and to a greater degree. Compared with the median nerve, the change in ulnar nerve signal amplitude during ischemia was significantly greater after 4 min (P = 0.002). This trend persisted at 6 and 8 min (P = 0.008). At 4, 6, and 8 min of ischemia, the ulnar nerve likewise showed a greater decrease in amplitude compared with the radial nerve, with corresponding P values of 0.015, 0.008, and 0.008. We conclude that the ulnar nerve is more sensitive to ischemia of the upper extremity compared with the radial and median nerves. In addition to its increased vulnerability at the elbow, compromise of arterial flow may contribute to some cases of postoperative ulnar neuropathy. IMPLICATIONS: Postoperative ulnar neuropathy is thought to result from compression or stretch of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. However, patients may sustain this complication despite careful padding and positioning. This study suggests that the ulnar nerve may also be unusually sensitive to decreases in blood supply to the arm. Care should not only to properly position and pad the elbows, but also to ensure adequate perfusion of the upper extremities.

TI  - Doxorubicin-induced alterations of c-myc and c-jun gene expression in rat glioblastoma cells: role of c-jun in drug resistance and cell death.  
AB  - We studied the effect of doxorubicin on the expression of c-myc and c-jun in the rat glioblastoma cell line C6 and its doxorubicin-resistant variant C6 0.5, at equitoxic exposures. For quantitation, the mRNA levels of these oncogenes were related to those of two domestic genes, beta-actin and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase.  After a transient overexpression of the genes during the first hour of incubation, there was a selective, dose-dependent down-regulation of both genes by doxorubicin in the sensitive cells. In the resistant cell line, c-myc expression was also decreased in response to doxorubicin incubation, but the expression of c-jun remained unchanged over the whole range of concentrations. In contrast, vincristine had no effect on the amounts of c-myc and c-jun mRNAs in either line. The effect of doxorubicin on the mRNA levels of c-jun was also observed on the JUN proteins by immunoblotting, but the MYC protein levels remained unchanged upon doxorubicin treatment. There was a significant correlation between the levels of c-myc and c-jun gene expression and the degree of growth inhibition induced by doxorubicin. In addition, doxorubicin induced a fragmentation of DNA in sensitive cells, but not in resistant cells, thus revealing a resistance to apoptosis in this line. Doxorubicin-induced cell death did not appear to be mediated by p53 in either cell line.

TI  - PU.1 regulates both cytokine-dependent proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors.  
AB  - PU.1 is a unique regulatory protein required for the generation of both the innate and the adaptive immune system. It functions exclusively in a cell-intrinsic manner to control the development of granulocytes, macrophages, and B and T lymphocytes. We demonstrate that mutation of the PU.1 gene causes a severe reduction in myeloid (granulocyte/macrophage) progenitors. PU.1 -/- myeloid progenitors can proliferate in vitro in response to the multilineage cytokines interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6 and stem cell factor but are unresponsive to the myeloid-specific cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF and M-CSF. The failure of PU.1 -/- progenitors to respond to G-CSF is bypassed by transient signaling with IL-3. In the presence of IL-3 and G-CSF, PU.1 -/- progenitors can differentiate into granulocytic precursors containing myeloperoxidase-positive granules. Thus PU.1 is not essential for specification of granulocytic precursors, but is required for their further differentiation. The failure of PU.1 -/- progenitors to respond to M-CSF is due to lack of c-fms gene transcription. Transduction of c-fms into PU.1 -/- myeloid progenitors bypasses the block to M-CSF-dependent proliferation but does not induce detectable macrophage differentiation. Therefore, PU. 1 appears to be essential for specification of monocytic precursors. Importantly, retroviral transduction of PU.1 into mutant progenitors restores responsiveness to myeloid-specific cytokines and development of mature granulocytes and macrophages. Thus PU.1 controls myelopoiesis by regulating both proliferation and differentiation pathways.

TI  - Antitumor immunity induction by intracellular hyperthermia using magnetite cationic liposomes.  
AB  - Induction of antitumor immunity to T-9 rat glioma by intracellular hyperthermia using functional magnetic particles was investigated. Magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs), which have a positive surface charge, were used as heating mediators for intracellular hyperthermia. Solid T-9 glioma tissues were formed subcutaneously on both femurs of female F344 rats, and MCLs were injected via a needle only into the left solid tumors (treatment side). The rats were then divided into two groups, which received no irradiation, or irradiation for 30 min given three times at 24-h intervals with an alternating magnetic field (118 kHz, 384 Oe). On the treatment side, the tumor tissue disappeared completely in many rats exposed to the magnetic field. The tumor tissue on the opposite side also disappeared completely, even though MCLs were not injected into the right solid tumors. To examine whether a long-lasting and tumor-specific immunity could be generated, the rats that had been cured by the hyperthermia treatment were rechallenged with T-9 cells 3 months later. After a period of transient growth, all tumors disappeared. Furthermore, immunocytochemical assay revealed that the immune response induced by the hyperthermia treatment was mediated by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and accompanied by a marked augmentation of tumor-selective cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. These results suggest that our magnetic particles are potentially effective tools for hyperthermic treatment of solid tumors, because in addition to killing of the tumor cells by heat, a host immune response is induced.

Flunitrazepam exposure also abolished the flunitrazepam potentiation of the GABA response, caused a transient reduction of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit proteins over the initial 2 days, but did not alter [3H]muscimol binding compared with vehicle-treated cells.

TI  - Gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor function is desensitised in rat cultured cerebellar granule cells following chronic flunitrazepam treatment.  
AB  - This study examined gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor function in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells by using microphysiometry following chronic flunitrazepam exposure, and correlated the findings with the alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit protein expression and [3H]muscimol binding after the same treatment paradigm. Flunitrazepam treatment reduced (p < 0.05) the maximal GABA-stimulated increase in extracellular acidification rate (Emax) (16.5 +/- 1.2% and 11.3 +/- 1.0%, 2-day control and treated cells, respectively; 17.4 +/- 1.0% and 9.9 +/- 0.7%, 7-day control and treated cells, respectively; best-fit Emax +/- SEM, n = 7), without affecting the GABA concentration required to elicit 50% of maximal response (EC50) (1.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.3 +/- 1.8 microM, 2-day control and treated cells, respectively; 1.7 +/- 1.5 and 1.5 +/- 1.5 microM, 7-day control and treated cells, respectively; best-fit EC50 +/- SEM, n = 7). Flunitrazepam exposure also abolished the flunitrazepam potentiation of the GABA response, caused a transient reduction of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit proteins over the initial 2 days, but did not alter [3H]muscimol binding compared with vehicle-treated cells. The results suggest that changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression, rather than loss of [3H]muscimol binding sites, underlie the chronic flunitrazepam-mediated desensitisation of GABA(A) receptor function.

Our results also indicate that an accurate assessment of the transient properties of folding intermediates that dictate the initial chaperonin-substrate interactions requires the use of the activated complex as the interacting chaperonin species.

TI  - Changing the nature of the initial chaperonin capture complex influences the substrate folding efficiency.  
AB  - For the chaperonin substrates, rhodanese, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and glutamine synthetase (GS), the folding efficiencies, and the lifetimes of folding intermediates were measured with either the nucleotide-free GroEL or the activated ATP.GroEL.GroES chaperonin complex. With both nucleotide-free and activated complex, the folding efficiency of rhodanese and MDH remained high over a large range of GroEL to substrate concentration ratios (up to 1:1). In contrast, the folding efficiency of GS began to decline at ratios lower than 8:1. At ratios where the refolding yields were initially the same, only a relatively small increase (1.6-fold) in misfolding kinetics of MDH was observed with either the nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin complex. For rhodanese, no change was detected with either chaperonin complex. In contrast, GS lost its ability to interact with the chaperonin system at an accelerated rate (8-fold increase) when the activated complex instead of the nucleotide-free complex was used to rescue the protein from misfolding. Our data demonstrate that the differences in the refolding yields are related to the intrinsic folding kinetics of the protein substrates. We suggest that the early kinetic events at the substrate level ultimately govern successful chaperonin-substrate interactions and play a crucial role in dictating polypeptide flux through the chaperonin system. Our results also indicate that an accurate assessment of the transient properties of folding intermediates that dictate the initial chaperonin-substrate interactions requires the use of the activated complex as the interacting chaperonin species.

TI  - Characterization of viremia at different stages of varicella-zoster virus infection.  
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) viremia at different stages of infection was characterized. Different approaches were used, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), isothermal transcription based nucleic acid amplification (NASBA), and immunofluorescence to describe and quantitate viral infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In patients with acute varicella 200 to 5,000 copies of the viral genome in every 150,000 PBMC were found with quantitative competitive PCR (QCPCR). With NASBA, viral transcriptional activity was detected in these cells. RNA transcribed from the immediate early gene IE 63 as well as from the late gene 68 were found, indicating a productive infection. Glycoprotein gE specific immunofluorescence visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that only 1 in 10,000 to 100,000 PBMC was infected. T and B lymphocytes as well as monocytes expressed viral protein on their surface. Similar results were obtained with PBMC from immunocompetent zoster patients. In some cases a transient viremia was found shortly after the onset of rash, although the viral load seemed to be lower than in patients with varicella. Examination of blood samples from 16 persons with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) signs of viral replication in PBMC were not detected. In conclusion, the data suggest that VZV viremia is a frequent event in patients with varicella and zoster, but not in those with postherpetic neuralgia. Moreover, the results indicated that subclinical reactivations occur both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals.

TI  - Effect of positioning on SvO2 in the critically ill patient with a low ejection fraction.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with a low ejection fraction may be vulnerable to decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) resulting from position change. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe the effects of changes in positioning on SvO2 in critically ill patients with a low ejection fraction (< or = 30%) and to describe the contribution of variables of oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) to the variance in SvO2. METHOD: An experimental two-group repeated-measures design was used to study 42 critically ill patients with an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 30% (M= 19.5%). Patients were assigned randomly to one of two position sequences: supine, right lateral, left lateral; or supine, left lateral, right lateral. Data on SvO2 were collected at baseline, each minute after position change for 5 minutes, and at 15 and 25 minutes. RESULTS: Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance showed a difference in SvO2 among the three positions across time (p< .0001), with the greatest differences occurring within the first 4 minutes and in the left lateral position. Stepwise multiple regression showed that VO2 accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in SvO2 with position change than did DO2 (54% [p = .001] vs. 31% [p= .001]). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in SVO2 occur with positioning in critically ill patients with a low ejection fraction. These changes are transient and are the result of changes in VO2 rather than changes in DO2.

TI  - Effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and calcium mobilization in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.  
AB  - The effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil on catecholamine secretion and free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were studied to evaluate the role of the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in the regulation of a [Ca2+]i-dependent secretory process. These effects were compared with those of nifedipine, a typical voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker. Carbachol produced a rapid increase followed by a sustained increase of [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ transient) in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Both nitroprusside and nicorandil accelerated the decrease in [Ca2+]i without changing the peak values of the initial [Ca2+]i increase of Ca2+ transient. These drugs, however, did not affect carbachol-induced catecholamine secretion, suggesting that secretion is related to the initial [Ca2+]i increase and not to a late sustained [Ca2+]i increases. However, nifedipine reduced the peak and duration of carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i increases and decreased the secretion of catecholamines. Diethylamine/NO complex, an NO donor, and dibutyryl-cGMP produced similar changes in Ca2+ transient and did not alter catecholamine secretion, suggesting that the effects of nitroprusside and nicorandil were mediated by the NO/cGMP pathway. These results indicated that the pattern of Ca2+ transient, especially the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, is important in secretion of catecholamine.

TI  - Adrenergic- and capsaicin-evoked nitric oxide release from urothelium and afferent nerves in urinary bladder.  
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the regulation of the lower urinary tract. However, the source(s) of NO production in the urinary bladder (UB) has not been determined. Accordingly, we used a porphyrinic microsensor placed on the surface of UB strips in vitro to directly measure endogenous NO production. The afferent neurotoxin, capsaicin, and the mixed alpha/beta-adrenergic agonist, norepinephrine (NE), both evoked transient (1-3 s) NO release (range 50 nM to 1.4 microM). Adrenergic-mediated release was not decreased following denervation of the UB but was abolished following selective removal of the mucosa. On the other hand, release evoked by capsaicin (range 50-900 nM) was significantly decreased after UB denervation. These data indicate that NE releases NO from UB epithelium, and capsaicin releases NO from epithelium as well as nervous tissue in the UB. In light of reports that NO may regulate epithelial integrity and function in other tissues, agonist regulation of a constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity in the UB may provide a novel mechanism for modulation of bladder and urothelial function.

The positive inotropic effect of Org 9731 at 3 microM and higher (up to 0.1 mM) was associated with an increase in the amplitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transient, but the effect of the compound at 0.3 and 1 mM was accompanied by a decrease of the transient.

TI  - Effects of a novel cardiotonic agent, Org 9731, on force and aequorin light transients in intact ventricular myocardium of the dog: involvement of a cyclic AMP-mediated mechanism and myofibrillar responsiveness to Ca2+ ions.  
AB  - The action of a novel cardiotonic agent, Org 9731 (4-fluoro-N-hydroxy-5, 6-dimethoxy-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboximidamide methanesulphonate), on intracellular aequorin light transients and isometric contractions was investigated in ventricular trabeculae isolated from dogs. The positive inotropic effect of Org 9731 at 3 microM and higher (up to 0.1 mM) was associated with an increase in the amplitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transient, but the effect of the compound at 0.3 and 1 mM was accompanied by a decrease of the transient. The maximum inotropic response to Org 9731 was approximately 70% of the maximum response to isoproterenol, while the maximum increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients produced by Org 9731 was about 30% of the maximum increase induced by isoproterenol. The duration of isometric contractions was prolonged by Org 9731 at 0.3 and 1 mM, with accompanying prolongation of the duration of light transients. The concentration-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of Org 9731 was markedly shifted by carbachol (3 microM), being moved to the right and downward, and the maximum response to Org 9731 was about 10% of that to isoproterenol in the presence of carbachol. Carbachol abolished the increase in the light transient and the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) induced by Org 9731. These results indicate that Org 9731 increases cardiac contractility, mainly through the accumulation of cyclic AMP up to a concentration of 0.1 mM and also by increasing the responsiveness of myofibrils to Ca2+ ions at 0.3 mM and higher in association with the attenuation of Ca2+ transients. The structure-activity relationship implies that the introduction of a fluorine atom at position 4 of the benzothiophene ring of Org 30,029 attenuated its Ca(2+)-sensitizing action but markedly increased the activity of mechanisms dependent on cyclic AMP.
