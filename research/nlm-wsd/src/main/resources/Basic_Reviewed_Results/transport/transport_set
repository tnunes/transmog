TI  - Transport of glutathione S-conjugates in Escherichia coli.  
AB  - There are no reports concerning glutathione-S-conjugates transport in prokaryotic cells, although many studies have been performed in eukaryotic systems. This study demonstrates that glutathione S-conjugates (2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione and bimane-S-glutathione) are transported also out of Escherichia coli K12 cells. This transport is inhibited by vanadate, fluoride and other inhibitors of glutathione S-conjugate transport in mammalian cells suggesting a similarity of this process to that known in eukaryotes.

TI  - Ancient DNA from Polynesian rats: extraction, amplification and sequence from single small bones.  
AB  - The human colonisation of Polynesia was a major event in world prehistory. It represents one of the last human population migrations, and one which required crossing major water barriers. Though the subject of Pacific population origins has been approached by scholars from numerous fields for nearly a century, recent years have seen the problem addressed by human geneticists. Since the initial report describing the recovery of DNA from skeletal remains, ancient DNA studies have also focused on the Pacific region. In this paper we present the results of ancient DNA analyses of Rattus exulans, an animal that was transported by ancestral Polynesians through the Pacific to the far reaches of the Polynesian triangle. Analysis of DNA of R. exulans skeletal remains has many advantages over studies of ancient human remains, yet the one drawback has been the recovery of ancient DNA from single bones of these very small rodents. We have successfully modified standard extraction protocols for ancient DNA and have consistently extracted, amplified and sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from less than 0.1 g of R. exulans bone and tooth samples recovered from archaeological sites throughout the Pacific, ranging from 400 to 2000 years old.

TI  - Characterization of diadenosine polyphosphate transport into chromaffin granules from adrenal medulla.  
AB  - The transport of diadenosine polyphosphates into chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla has been studied by using the radiolabeled substrate [3H]Ap5A and the fluorescent substrate analog di(1,N6-ethenoadenosine)polyphosphate, epsilon-(Ap(n)A) (n=3-5). The vesicular concentration increase was time dependent and the substrates were not metabolized to any extent during the transport experiments. The saturation curve indicates the existence of kinetic and allosteric cooperativity during Ap(n)A (diadenosine polyphosphates) transport and could be the result of the presence of various affinity states of the transporter with K values of 16 +/- 1 microM and 75 +/- 6 microM, and corresponding Hill numbers of 2 and 4, when epsilon-(Ap4A) was the substrate. The saturation studies for [3H]Ap5A were performed in a broader concentration range; in this case a three-step curve was obtained with K values of 16 +/- 2 microM, 125 +/- 9 microM, and 545 +/- 11 microM; the corresponding Hill numbers were 2, 4, and 6. This kinetic behavior can be explained on the basis of a mnemonic model, as already demonstrated for the vesicular transport of ATP. The nonhydrolyzable adenine nucleotide analogs, ATPgammaS and ADPbetaS, inhibited the diadenosine polyphosphate transport at concentrations in the millimolar range. Ap(n)A transport was also inhibited by the P2 receptor antagonist suramin, the mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchange inhibitor atractyloside, the proton translocator FCCP, and N-ethylmaleimide.

TI  - [Involvement of the lymphatic system in primary non-lymphogenic edema of the leg. Studies with 2-compartment lymphoscintigraphy]  
AB  - Two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy was developed to examine the sub- and epifascial lymphatics of the leg. Digital images were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively by calculating the uptake of activity within the lymph nodes. The data from patient groups with four different types of leg edema were compared with those of the control group to prove the involvement of the lymphatics in the non-lymphatic edema. The cyclic idiopathic edema demonstrated an accelerated transport of the lymph consistent with a high volume insufficiency. In phlebedema the high volume insufficiency was epifascially so distinct, that it could be detected scintigraphically. In post thrombotic syndrome the transport of the lymph was reduced dramatically corresponding to a safety valve insufficiency. Epifascially however, an accelerated lymph flow was observed due to compensatory mechanisms. The lipedema did not show any scintigraphic abnormalities. These results show that two-compartment lymphoscintigraphy can detect alterations in lymphatic function secondary to non-lymphogenic leg edema. The lymphatic function is changed according to the underlying pathophysiology which may be facilitate the differential diagnosis of such a leg edema.

TI  - Differential modes of nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognition by three distinct classes of NLS receptors.  
AB  - The targeting of karyophilic proteins to nuclear pores is mediated via the formation of a nuclear pore-targeting complex, through the interaction of nuclear localization signal (NLS) with its NLS receptor. Recently, a novel human protein, Qip1, was identified from a yeast two-hybrid system with DNA helicase Q1. This study demonstrates that Qip1 is a novel third class of NLS receptor that efficiently recognizes the NLS of the helicase Q1. Moreover, the data obtained in this study show that the specific interaction between Qip1 and the NLS of the helicase Q1 requires its upstream sequence of the minimal essential NLS. By using purified recombinant proteins alone in the digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport system, it was demonstrated that the two known human NLS receptors, Rch1 and NPI-1, are able to transport all the tested NLS substrates into the nucleus, while Qip1 most efficiently transports the helicase Q1-NLS substrates, which contain its upstream sequence in so far as we have examined the system. Furthermore, in HeLa cell crude cytosol, it was found that endogenous Rch1 binds to all the tested NLS substrates, while the binding of endogenous NPI-1 is restricted to only some NLSs, despite the fact that NPI-1 itself shows binding activity to a variety of NLSs. These results indicate that at least three structurally and functionally distinct NLS receptors exist in the human single cell population, and suggest that the nuclear import of karyophilic proteins may be controlled in a complex manner at the NLS recognition step by the existence of a variety of NLS receptors with various specificities to each NLS.

TI  - New evidence for two MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation pathways by overexpression of a small G protein.  
AB  - Exogenous Ags may be presented by MHC class II molecules through two distinct pathways distinguished by their sensitivity to drugs that inhibit the protein synthesis. Using this approach, we previously showed that the subunits Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, associated to B cell Ag receptor, targeted Ags either to newly synthesized or to preexisting pools of MHC class II molecules, respectively. To further characterize these two Ag presentation pathways, we altered the intra-Golgi transport of newly synthesized MHC class II by stably overexpressing, in B cells, mutants of a small G protein involved in the intra-Golgi transport, Rab6. Overexpression of GTP-bound rab6 (Q72L) mutant proteins reduced the cell surface arrival of MHC class II molecules and consequently slowed down Ag presentation dependent upon newly synthesized class II molecules. In contrast, this mutant had no effect on Ag presentation dependent upon preexisting pools of class II molecules, and the overexpression of an inactive GDP-bound form of rab6 (T27N) did not affect any Ag presentation pathway. MHC class II-restricted Ag presentation pathways can therefore be distinguished by their sensitivity to the overexpression of proteins modifying the intracellular transport of newly synthesized class II molecules.

TI  - [The localization and functional significance of arylsulfatases in parasitic sarcosporidian protozoa in the tissue-cyst life cycle phase]  
AB  - The hydrolytic enzymes arylsulphatases (AS) were detected in developing tissue cysts of Sarcocystis ovifelis, using two methods: the Goldfischer lead technique, with two different pH values-5.5 (AS-A) and 4.2 (AS-B), and the Hopsu-Havu barium technique (Gayer, 1974). The enzymatic activity was identified by the presence of an electron dense finely granulated precipitation. In cyst cells, lead sulphate precipitation was spotted only in the inner membrane complex (IC) of the pellicle, whereas barium sulphate marked, in addition, the plasma membrane. Besides, AS activity was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, lysosomes and micronemes of cyst cells. Of interest is the finding of AS in the outer membrane of IC and matrix of pellicular evaginations. In the cyst ground substance (CGS) of S. ovifelis AS activity is confined to the membrane and matrix of transport vesicles, originating from cyst cell pellicle evaginations. These cystic vesicles carry enzymes from the places of their synthesis, in the cyst cells, to the tissue cyst periphery near the cyst wall. In the CGS, the obvious precipitations of lead and barium sulphate, respectively, are seen around some cyst cells being in the state of destroying due to natural death, and around so-called apoptotic-like bodies made from the destroyed cells. AS activity is seen both in the cyst wall and in vesicles separating from the wall ("wall vesicles") that find eventually their way in the cytoplasm of infected muscle cells, the granulation being observed around destroyed organelles of such cells. The investigated dynamics of AS movement, by means of the transport cystic and wall vesicles, extends general knowledge of the distant metabolic interaction between cells of the host and the parasite in tissue cysts of Sarcocystis spp.

TI  - Functional complementation of a membrane transport deficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant ND4 fusion protein.  
AB  - ND4 is a mitochondrially encoded component of NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) of the respiratory chain. A cDNA encoding a fusion protein comprised of the N-terminus of GAL10 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an N-terminally truncated form of human ND4 was isolated by its ability to functionally complement the thymidine transport deficiency of S. cerevisiae grown under conditions of thymidylate starvation. Epitope-tagged GAL10-ND4 was shown by immunological methods to be present in the plasma membranes of yeast expressing the GAL10-ND4 encoding cDNA. The ability of the GAL10-ND4 fusion protein to induce uptake of thymidine raises the possibility that native ND4, which is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, may function as a transporter or channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

TI  - Uptake of Ga-67 into rat cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum. Comparison with Fe-59.  
AB  - Transferrin and transferrin receptors play an important role in the transport of iron into the brain. To determine whether gallium enters the brain by the same mechanism, uptakes of 67Ga and 59Fe have been compared under controlled conditions. Rates of gallium penetration into brain (K(in)) were four times slower than those for 59Fe. K(in) for 67Ga when infused with citrate were 0.88 +/- 0.24 and 0.94 +/- 0.39 x 10(-3) ml g-1h-1 for cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum, respectively. When infused as the transferrin complex, 67Ga uptake into the brain was not different from that when infused with citrate. The presence of the anti-transferrin receptor antibody OX-26 significantly reduced uptake of 59Fe by 60% and 64% into cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum, respectively. By contrast, pretreatment of rats with OX-26 enhanced the uptake of 67Ga into brain, particularly when infused with citrate; mean increases in uptake of 67Ga were 120% and 144% for cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum, respectively. Purified 67Ga-transferrin was also taken up into both brain regions examined in the presence of OX-26. These results indicate that the transport of non-transferrin bound gallium is an important mechanism for gallium uptake into brain.

TI  - Shackling of broilers: effects on stress responses and breast meat quality.  
AB  - 1. Experiments were conducted to study the welfare and meat quality effects of shackling. In experiment 1, broilers with or without leg problems were shackled (S) for 4 min on a moving line and blood sampled; or handled (H), returned to the crate and sampled after 4 min; or sampled immediately after removal from the crate (control, C). 2. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations, as measured by radioimmunoassay, were highest in S and lowest in C, while the H group was intermediate. Leg problems had no effect on CORT. 3. In experiment 2, tonic immobility (TI) was induced in broilers after 2 min inverted handling to determine fear responses. One week later, the birds were fasted, transported and then shackled on a moving shackle line for 0, 1, 3 or 4 min, then unshackled and blood sampled. Wing flapping during shackling was also quantified. 4. Shackling time did not influence CORT concentrations. There was a negative correlation (r = -0.714) between CORT and wing flapping duration in the 1 min shackling treatment. There was no relationship between TI and wing flapping or CORT. 5. In experiment 3, broilers were exposed to two food withdrawal (FW) times (food withdrawn overnight or during crating only) and held for 4 h prior to processing, shackled (0, 2 or 4 min shackling time, ST), and then killed by exsanguination. Blood samples were collected during the neck-cut. Pectoralis superficialis and Supracoracoideus samples were either collected after 15 min and individually quick frozen (IQF) in liquid nitrogen or collected at 4 h post mortem from carcases chilled on slush ice (COI). 6. CORT increased significantly with increased ST. There was a FW x ST interaction effect on the initial pH of fillets. ST influenced the b*, chroma and Hue values of the COI fillets. FW influenced the L* and Hue values of both IQF and COI fillets as well as the a* value of the COI fillets. 7. In summary, CORT increased with shackling time when birds were held after transport. FW and ST also influenced the colour of fillets, although it is not clear whether these changes are perceptible to the consumer. The duration of wing flapping during shackling did not appear to be related to fearfulness, although it was influenced by properties of the shackle line. We suggest that there be a maximum time lapse between shackling and stunning or killing of 2 min to minimise stress and meat quality changes.

TI  - Blood transfusion in disasters, war, and emergencies.  
AB  - Historically, the needs of those wounded in war have led to many major advances in blood transfusion. The most important of these is probably the ability to draw blood in one location and transfuse it, at a later time, in a distant location. Another important lesson is the need for meticulous planning. Every hospital and blood center should have a disaster plan consisting of five components. What fluids to use, from where are they to be obtained, to what degree are they to be tested, how will they be transported to the disaster scene, and, once there, how will they be stored. Once drawn up, this plan must be regularly exercised and periodically revised. This will ensure rapid and efficient implementation when an emergency arises. Triage is vital in mass casualty situations, ensuring that scarce resources are used for those with the best chance of recovery. Although patients survive with low hemoglobin levels for considerable periods, speedy treatment of hypovolemia is imperative. When perflourochemicals and hemoglobin solutions are available for general clinical use, they will have a major role to play in disasters. Similarly, a simple method for the cryopreservation of red cells will allow stockpiles to be established. Unfortunately, none of these are presently available, although some are undergoing clinical trials.

TI  - Characterization and regulation of taurine transport in Caco-2, human intestinal cells.

The activity of taurine transport in Caco-2 cells was evaluated by means of an Na+- and Cl(-)-dependent high-affinity transport system, the characteristics of which were similar to those of the beta-amino acid-specific taurine transport system previously described for various tissues. The activity of taurine transport was down-regulated on culturing in taurine-containing medium. This taurine-induced down-regulation was dependent on both the incubation time with taurine and the concentration of taurine. Hypotaurine and beta-alanine were also capable of inducing this adaptive regulation, whereas alpha-amino acids and gamma-aminoisobutyric acid were not. Kinetic analysis of control and taurine-treated cells suggested that the down-regulation was associated with a decrease in the maximal velocity of taurine transport and also with a decrease in the affinity of the taurine transporter. Cycloheximide treatment weakened the taurine-induced down-regulation. The mRNA level of the taurine transporter (HTAU type) in taurine-treated cells was markedly decreased compared with in control cells. These results indicate that a complex regulatory mechanism is involved in this down-regulation.

TI  -  Deficient muscle carnitine transport in primary carnitine deficiency.  
AB  - Primary carnitine deficiency is associated with deficient blood and tissue carnitine concentrations. The clinical syndrome is dominated by heart and skeletal muscle symptoms, and the clinical response to oral carnitine supplementation is life-saving. Carnitine uptake has been shown to be defective in cultured skin fibroblasts and leukocytes obtained from patients with this condition. We report a new case of primary carnitine deficiency and offer direct evidence consistent with an impairment of carnitine uptake in differentiating muscle culture. The patient presented with severe and progressive cardiomyopathy and moderate proximal limb weakness. Plasma and muscle carnitine levels were very low, and the maximal rate of carnitine transport in cultured fibroblasts was deficient. An asymptomatic sister with intermediate levels of carnitine in plasma showed partially deficient carnitine uptake in fibroblasts, indicating heterozygosity. The patient's condition improved dramatically with oral carnitine therapy. Further studies were performed in cultured muscle cells at different stages of maturation, which demonstrated deficient maximal rates of carnitine uptake. Our findings are consistent with the concept that primary carnitine deficiency is the result of a generalized defect involving carnitine transport across tissue membranes.

TI  - Enterohepatic circulation of scymnol sulfate in an elasmobranch, the little skate (Raja erinacea).  
AB  - The sulfated bile alcohol scymnol sulfate (ScyS), 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24 xi, 26,27-hexahydroxy-5 beta-cholestane-26(27)-sulfate, is the major bile salt in bile of an elasmobranch, the little skate. To investigate hepatic transport of bile alcohols in skate liver, [3H]ScyS and a potential precursor, 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestane (chtriol), were used as model compounds. Their transport into isolated hepatocytes was partially saturable, temperature sensitive, and Na+ independent. The uptake of ScyS was inhibited by cholyltaurine, and uptake of cholyltaurine was inhibited by ScyS in a competitive manner. In contrast, uptake of chtriol was not inhibited by cholyltaurine, suggesting separate transport systems. ScyS and chtriol showed a choleretic effect in isolated perfused livers. When ScyS was added to the perfusate of isolated perfused livers, > 25% was found in bile within 7 h. When chtriol was added to the perfusate, 10% of the dose was secreted into the bile mainly in the form of polar metabolites, whereas only nonmetabolized chtriol remained in the livers. The slow bile flow of 40-50 microliters/h and the high recovery in the liver suggest that metabolism may be the rate-limiting step in the hepatic elimination of chtriol. The major metabolites secreted into bile were identified by mass spectrometry and chromatography as scymnol and ScyS. To study the enterohepatic circulation, [3H]ScyS or [3H]chtriol was administered into the duodenum of free-swimming skates, and bile was collected through exteriorized indwelling cannulas over a 4-day period. More than 90% of the radioactivity was recovered from bile, indicating that there was a highly effective absorption in the intestinal epithelium, as well as specific transport mechanisms for hepatic uptake and biliary secretion of these compounds. This is the first direct demonstration of an enterohepatic circulation for a bile alcohol sulfate in fish liver.

AB  - The segmental difference of water and electrolyte transport in the rat colon was studied in vivo. The proximal and distal colon segments were perfused separately but simultaneously at a constant rate with physiological solution, and net movements of water, sodium and chloride were determined. The effects of osmolality and sodium concentration of perfusate were assessed. The effect of a sodium channel blocker on the net transport of water and electrolytes was also studied in each colon segment. The net absorption of water, sodium and chloride correlated with the sodium concentration and osmolality of the perfusion solution in both colon segments and were dominant in the distal colon segment in each condition, compared with that in the proximal colon segment. The concentrations of three electrolytes in the collected fluid were almost the same as those of the perfusion solutions in both segments and these results indicated that water was transported isotonically through the colon lumen. Benzamil, a specific sodium ion channel blocker, inhibited net water and sodium absorption by 58.8% and 63.1% in the proximal colon segment and by 52.0% and 43.6% in the distal colon segment, respectively. These results suggest the existence of an electrogenic sodium transport mechanism and a paracellular pathway in normal (i.e., not treated with corticosteroids or sodium-depleted food) rats which has not been detected in in vitro studies with both apical and basolateral membrane vesicles.

TI  - Gene activation, apolipoprotein A-I/high density lipoprotein, atherosclerosis prevention and longevity.  
AB  - Recent studies in man and human apolipoprotein A-I transgenic animals emphasize the significance of apolipoprotein A-I and high density lipoprotein in antiatherogenesis. Several drugs and other compounds, e.g. phenobarbital, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, prednisone, estrogen and alcohol, induce apolipoprotein A-I synthesis. They commonly produce serum lipoprotein patterns typical of a low risk of coronary heart disease, and many of them have been found to prevent atherogenesis, reduce coronary heart disease mortality and increase survival. These compounds act against atherosclerosis by using one or several mechanisms that include overexpression of the apolipoprotein A-I gene with an increase in serum apolipoprotein A-I and high density lipoprotein and promotion of reverse cholesterol transport, upregulation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene with a decrease in serum apolipoprotein B and low density lipoprotein, maintenance of endothelial cell function and protection against thrombosis. They have been found to raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I together with a decrease in cholesterol ester transfer protein activity, and to induce hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and cholesterol and bile acid elimination from the body. By raising the activities of apolipoprotein A-I/high density lipoprotein-associated paraoxonase and other antioxidative enzymes, the inducers have the capacity to prevent atherogenesis in arterial walls through inhibition of the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein. Other antiatherogenic vascular actions of high density lipoprotein include interference with low density lipoprotein aggregation and uptake by endothelial cells, and competition with low density lipoprotein for endothelial-localized low density lipoprotein receptors. Apolipoprotein A-I/high density lipoprotein beneficially enhances fibrinolysis, decreases platelet aggregation, increases prostacyclin production and stabilization and prevents atherogenic immune and inflammatory responses. This gene activation or microsomal induction can prevent atherosclerosis and is a basis for tailoring effective new agents and optimal non-invasive therapy against atherosclerotic vascular disease to promote health and enhance longevity.

TI  - ATPase activity of purified multidrug resistance-associated protein [published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1998 Mar 27;273(13):7782]  
AB  - Human multidrug resistance protein (MRP) was expressed at high levels in stably transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. These cells exhibited a pattern of cross-resistance to several different drugs typical of an MRP-mediated phenotype despite the addition of 10 histidine residues at the C terminus to facilitate purification. Consistent with this functional evidence of the presence of MRP at the surface of these transfectants, strong signals were detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using a specific monoclonal antibody to MRP. There was intense uniform staining of the cell surface as well as weaker staining of intracellular membranes. MRP-containing membranes were solubilized in 1% N-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside in the presence of 0.4% sheep brain phospholipids. Two sequential affinity purification steps on Ni-NTA agarose and wheat germ agglutinin agarose provided substantial enrichment, and contaminating bands were not detected. ATPase activity of the purified protein was assayed in the presence of the phospholipids, which had been maintained throughout all purification steps. ATP was hydrolyzed in proportion to the amount of purified protein assayed, and typical Michaelis-Menten behavior was exhibited, yielding estimations of Km of approximately 3.0 mM and Vmax of 0.46 micromol mg-1 min-1. This activity was moderately stimulated by the drugs that others have shown to be transported by MRP-containing membrane vesicles. This stimulation was enhanced by reduced glutathione as is its drug transport, and oxidized glutathione, itself a substrate for transport, caused a strong stimulation. These data describe the first purification of MRP and provide the first direct evidence that the molecule possesses drug-stimulated ATPase activity.

TI  - Cell surface and organelle transport share the same enzymatic properties in Reticulomyxa.  
AB  - Reticulomyxa transports particulates, like bacterial and algal prey items, bidirectionally along the outside of its pseudopodia. This cell surface transport and intracellular organelle transport can be reactivated in detergent permeabilized cell models [Orokos et al., 1997: Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton]. We have used this unique system to compare cell surface and organelle mechanochemistry in situ in the same reactivated pseudopodia. The ATPase activities of both types of transport were indistinguishable; each displayed identical nucleoside triphosphate specificity, transport ATPase kinetics, and inhibitor sensitivity. Organelle and cell surface transport reactivation required "hydrolyzable" adenosine nucleoside triphosphates; neither reactivated with GTP, CTP, UTP, ITP, AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, or ATP-gamma-S. However, other ATP analogues, such as 2'-deoxy-ATP and 3'-deoxy-ATP and 2',3'-dideoxy-ATP, supported the reactivation of organelle and cell surface transport at similar, but markedly reduced, velocities. Both transport processes were inhibited similarly by known inhibitors of dynein ATPases such as erythro-9-(3-[2-hydroxynonyl]) adenine (EHNA) or sodium (Na)-orthovanadate. N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in the presence of Na-orthovanadate and ATP permanently disabled both transport processes. Organelle and surface transport followed identical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a calculated Km of 118 microM ATP and a maximum translocation velocity (Vmax) of 8.33 microm/sec. These findings strongly suggest that cell surface transport shares the same cytoplasmic dynein motor [Schliwa et al., 1991: J. Cell Biol. 112:1199-1203] that drives organelle transport.

TI  - Characteristics of Fps1-dependent and -independent glycerol transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Eadie-Hofstee plots of glycerol uptake in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1A grown on glucose showed the presence of both saturable transport and simple diffusion, whereas an fps1delta mutant displayed only simple diffusion. Transformation of the fps1delta mutant with the glpF gene, which encodes glycerol transport in Escherichia coli, restored biphasic transport kinetics. Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose-grown wild-type cells had a higher passive diffusion constant than the fps1delta mutant, and ethanol enhanced the rate of proton diffusion to a greater extent in the wild type than in the fps1delta mutant. In addition, the lipid fraction of the fps1delta mutant contained a lower percentage of phospholipids and a higher percentage of glycolipids than that of the wild type. Fps1p, therefore, may be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae, affecting membrane permeability in addition to fulfilling its specific role in glycerol transport. Simultaneous uptake of glycerol and protons occurred in both glycerol- and ethanol-grown wild-type and fps1delta cells and resulted in the accumulation of glycerol at an inside-to-outside ratio of 12:1 to 15:1. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone prevented glycerol accumulation in both strains and abolished transport in the fps1delta mutant grown on ethanol. Likewise, 2,4-dinitrophenol inhibited transport in glycerol-grown wild-type cells. These results indicate the presence of an Fps1p-dependent facilitated diffusion system in glucose-grown cells and an Fps1p-independent proton symport system in derepressed cells.

TI  - Effect of osmolality and myo-inositol deprivation on the transport properties of myo-inositol in primary astrocyte cultures.  
AB  - myo-Inositol uptake measured in primary astrocyte cultures was saturable in the presence of Na+ with a Km of 13-18 microM and a Vmax of 9.4 nmoles/mg protein/hour in myo-inositol-fed cells, indicating a high affinity transport system. In myo-inositol-deprived cells, Km was about 53 microM with a Vmax of 13.2 nmoles/mg protein/hour. Decreasing osmolality decreased the Vmax to about 1.9 nmoles/mg protein/hour whereas increasing osmolality increased Vmax about 5-fold, while Kms were essentially unchanged in myo-inositol fed cells. In cells deprived of myo-inositol, Vmax decreased in hypotonic medium and increased in hypertonic medium almost 10-fold, but with more than a doubling of the Km regardless of the osmolality. Glucose (25 mM) inhibited myo-inositol uptake 51% whereas the other hexoses used inhibited uptake much less. Our findings indicate that myo-inositol uptake in astrocytes occurs through an efficient carrier-mediated Na(+)-dependent co-transport system that is different from that of glucose and its kinetic properties are affected by myo-inositol availability and osmotic stress.

TI  - Polar solute transport across the pigmented rabbit conjunctiva: size dependence and the influence of 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the conjunctival permeability to polar solutes ranging from 182 to 167,000 daltons in molecular weight (m.w.). METHODS: Solute transport across the excised pigmented rabbit conjunctiva with a baseline transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of 1,285 +/- 46 ohm.cm2 was evaluated in the modified Ussing chamber under open-circuit conditions. The model solutes were mannitol (m.w. 182), 6-carboxyfluorescein (m.w. 376), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans (FD4, m.w. 4,400-FD150, m.w. 167,000). RESULTS: For a given solute, the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was independent of solute concentration and direction of transport. As expected, the Papp decreased with solute size, from 27.7 x 10(-8) cm/sec for mannitol to 0.31 x 10(-8) cm/sec for FD150. When the experimental temperature was lowered from 37 degrees C to 4 degrees C. Papp decreased by approximately 50% for FD4 through FD40 and by > 80% for both FD70 and FD150. Equivalent pore analysis, assuming restricted solute diffusion via cylindrical, water-filled pores across the isolated tissue, revealed a radius of 5.5 nm at a pore density of 1.9 x 10(8) pores per cm2. The addition of 1 mM 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-BrcAMP), known to stimulate Cl- secretion and decrease TEER, to the mucosal side of the conjunctiva increased the transport of mannitol, FD4, and FD40 by 28%, while not affecting FD150 transport. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that polar solutes up to FD40 traverse the conjunctival epithelial barrier primarily by restricted diffusion through equivalent pores of 5.5 nm radius and that solute movement is affected by reduction of TEER. On the other hand, polar solutes of the FD70 or larger may cross the barrier primarily via non-diffusional pathways such as non-specific endocytosis.

TI  - Changes in calcium transport in mammalian sperm mitochondria and plasma membranes caused by 780 nm irradiation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations are very important in control of sperm motility and acrosome reaction. It was shown previously that low-power lasers in the visible and near-infrared range alter Ca2+ uptake by sperm cells. In the present work the effect of a 780 nm diode laser on Ca2+ uptake by sperm mitochondria and isolated plasma membrane vesicles is investigated. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Digitonin-treated spermatozoa and plasma membrane vesicles were irradiated with a 780-nm diode laser at various powers and energy doses, and Ca2+ uptake was measured by the filtration method. RESULTS: It was found that 780-nm irradiation inhibits Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria but stimulates Ca2+ binding by sperm plasma membrane vesicles. The effect of light on Ca2+ uptake by plasma membrane vesicles in the absence of ATP was much larger than that measured in the presence of ATP. Addition of Ca2+ ionophore decreased the Ca2+ uptake by the irradiated membranes in the presence of ATP but enhanced it significantly in the absence of ATP. CONCLUSION: 780 nm light inhibits Ca2+ uptake by sperm mitochondria and enhances Ca2+ binding to sperm plasma membranes.

TI  - Osmotic regulation of Na+ transport across A6 epithelium: interactions with prostaglandin E2 and cyclic AMP.  
AB  - Previous work from this laboratory has shown that apical membrane sodium channel activity is stimulated by serosal hyposmotic solutions (Wills, Millinoff & Crowe, 1991). In the present study, we determined whether this stimulation of sodium transport is additive with the actions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or cyclic AMP (cAMP). Addition of exogenous PGE2 (100 nM; serosal bath) to isosmotic solutions led to large increases in the amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial conductance (Gt), whereas no significant effects of PGE2 were observed in hyposmotic serosal solutions. Subsequent addition of mucosal amiloride reduced Isc by approximately 95% and Gt by approximately 60%. Inhibition of endogenous PGE2 production by blockers of phospholipase A2 activity (quinacrine or 3[4-octadecyl]-benzoylacrylic acid; OBBA), or inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by indomethacin reduced the stimulation of Isc and Gt by hyposmotic solutions. Addition of forskolin (FSK) or 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) also resulted in approximately twofold increases in the amiloride-sensitive Isc and Gt and abolished the effects of subsequent hyposmotic challenge. The effects of forskolin, PGE2, and hyposmotic challenge were diminished by pretreatment with H89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. We conclude that osmotic regulation of sodium channel activity interacts with multiple intracellular signaling pathways, specifically the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway and the cAMP/PKA intracellular messenger cascade.

TI  - Na+ influx and Na(+)-K+ pump activation during short-term exposure of cardiac myocytes to aldosterone.  
AB  - To examine the effect of aldosterone on sarcolemmal Na+ transport, we measured ouabain-sensitive electrogenic Na(+)-K+ pump current (Ip) in voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes and intracellular Na+ activity (alpha iNa) in right ventricular papillary muscles. Aldosterone (10 nM) induced an increase in both Ip and the rate of rise of alpha iNa during Na(+)-K+ pump blockade with the fast-acting cardiac steroid dihydroouabain. The aldosterone-induced increase in Ip and rate of rise of alpha iNa was eliminated by bumetanide, suggesting that aldosterone activates Na+ influx through the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter. To obtain independent support for this, the Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations in the superfusate and solution of pipettes used to voltage clamp myocytes were set at levels designed to abolish the inward electrochemical driving force for the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter. This eliminated the aldosterone-induced increase in Ip. We conclude that in vitro exposure of cardiac myocytes to aldosterone activates the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransporter to enhance Na+ influx and stimulate the Na(+)-K+ pump.

AB  - The influence of O2-Hb reaction kinetics and the Fahraeus effect on steady state O2 and CO2 transport in cat brain microcirculation was investigated using our refined multicompartmental model. The most important model predictions include: 1) capillaries are the sites in the microcirculation where the effect of O2-Hb kinetics is most pronounced; 2) while there is only a small difference between equilibrium and actual oxygen saturation, this effect is not negligible; 3) O2-Hb kinetics tends to make the PO2 level at the venous entrance higher than in venules; 4) the influence of the Fahraeus effect leads to a lower tissue PO2 level than in venules and the outlet vein. The resultant decline in tissue PO2 may lead to a decrease in O2 consumption rate and extraction ratio; 5) although the Fahraeus effect changes the ratio between arteriolar flux and capillary flux, incorporating the Fahraeus effect and O2-Hb kinetics into the simulation does not change our previous conclusion, that most of the O2 and CO2 exchange takes place at the capillary level; 6) in general, influences of O2-Hb kinetics and Fahraeus effect are synergistic; 7) a model that excludes these two mechanisms might overestimate the tissue oxygenation level especially during severe hypoxia.

TI  - Deletion of algK in mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa blocks alginate polymer formation and results in uronic acid secretion.  
AB  - Chronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and serious problem in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The P. aeruginosa isolates from these patients typically have a mucoid colony morphology due to overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate, which contributes to the persistence of the organisms in the CF lung. Most of the alginate biosynthetic genes are clustered in the algD operon, located at 34 min on the chromosome. Alginate biosynthesis begins with the formation of an activated monomer, GDP-mannuronate, which is known to occur via the products of the algA, algC, and algD genes. Polymannuronate forms in the periplasm, but the gene products involved in mannuronate translocation across the inner membrane and its polymerization are not known. One locus of the operon which remained uncharacterized was a new gene called algK between alg44 and algE. We sequenced algK from the mucoid CF isolate FRD1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli, which revealed a polypeptide of the predicted size (52 kDa). The sequence of AlgK showed an apparent signal peptide characteristic of a lipoprotein. AlgK-PhoA fusion proteins were constructed and shown to be active, indicating that AlgK has a periplasmic subcellular localization. To test the phenotype of an AlgK-mutant, the algK coding sequence was replaced with a nonpolar gentamicin resistance cassette to avoid polar effects on genes downstream of algK that are essential for polymer formation. The algKdelta mutant was nonmucoid, demonstrating that AlgK was required for alginate production. Also, AlgK- mutants demonstrated a small-colony phenotype on L agar, suggesting that the loss of AlgK also caused a growth defect. The mutant phenotypes were complemented by a plasmid expressing algK in trans. When the algKdelta mutation was placed in an algJ::Tn501 background, where algA was not expressed due to polar transposon effects, the growth defect was not observed. AlgK- mutants appeared to accumulate a toxic extracellular product, and we hypothesized that this could be an unpolymerized alginate precursor. High levels of low-molecular-weight uronic acid were produced by the AlgK- mutant. When AlgK- culture supernatants were subjected to dialysis, high levels of uronic acids diffused out of the dialysis sac, and no uronic acids were detectable after extensive dialysis. In contrast, the mucoid wild-type strain produced only polymerized uronic acids (i.e., alginate), whereas the algKdelta algJ::Tn501 mutant produced no uronic acids. Thus, the alginate pathway in an AlgK- mutant was blocked after transport but at a step before polymerization, suggesting that AlgK plays an important role in the polymerization of mannuronate to alginate.

TI  - Dehydroascorbate and ascorbate transport in rat liver microsomal vesicles.  
AB  - Ascorbate and dehydroascorbate transport was investigated in rat liver microsomal vesicles using radiolabeled compounds and a rapid filtration method. The uptake of both compounds was time- and temperature-dependent, and saturable. Ascorbate uptake did not reach complete equilibrium, it had low affinity and high capacity. Ascorbate influx could not be inhibited by glucose, dehydroascorbate, or glucose transport inhibitors (phloretin, cytochalasin B) but it was reduced by the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and by the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. Ascorbate uptake could be stimulated by ferric iron and could be diminished by reducing agents (dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione). In contrast, dehydroascorbate uptake exceeded the level of passive equilibrium, it had high affinity and low capacity. Glucose cis inhibited and trans stimulated the uptake. Glucose transport inhibitors were also effective. The presence of intravesicular reducing compounds increased, while extravesicular reducing environment decreased dehydroascorbate influx. Our results suggest that dehydroascorbate transport is preferred in hepatic endoplasmic reticulum and it is mediated by a GLUT-type transporter. The intravesicular reduction of dehydroascorbate leads to the accumulation of ascorbate and contributes to the low intraluminal reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio.

TI  - HCO3- absorption in rabbit outer medullary collecting duct: role of luminal carbonic anhydrase.  
AB  - Membrane-bound luminal carbonic anhydrase (CA) IV, by catalyzing the dehydration of carbonic acid into CO2 plus water, facilitates H+ secretion in the renal outer medullary collecting duct from the inner stripe (OMCDi). To examine the role of CA IV on H+ secretion, we measured net HCO3- transport in perfused OMCDi segments and examined the effect on transport of two extracellular CA inhibitors, benzolamide and F-3500, aminobenzolamide coupled to a nontoxic polymer, polyoxyethylene bis(acetic acid) [synthesized and kindly provided by C. Conroy and T. Maren (C. W. Conroy, G. C. Wynns, and T. H. Maren. Bioorg, Chem, 24: 262-272, 1996)]. These agents would inhibit only the luminal CA enzyme. Dose titration curves for net HCO3- flux were performed for each drug. Basal HCO3- absorptive flux was 12 pmol.min-1.mm-1 in control segments and significantly increased to 16 pmol.min-1.mm-1 in segments from 3-day acid-treated animals. The concentrations of benzolamide and F-3500 that inhibited HCO3- absorption by 50% were approximately 0.1 and approximately 5 microM, similar to the Ki for CA IV inhibition by these agents (0.2 and 4.0 microM, respectively; T. Maren, C. W. Conroy, G. C. Wynns, and D. R. Godman. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 280: 98-105, 1997). Adding exogenous CA to the inhibitor in the perfusate nearly restored basal HCO3- transport, suggesting that cytosolic CA II was not inhibited by these impermeant inhibitors. In OMCDi segments from acidotic rabbits, the concentrations of benzolamide and F-3500 that inhibited HCO3- absorption by 50% were 50 and 500 microM, respectively, > 100 times the Ki for CA IV inhibition and for inhibition of HCO3- transport in control tubules. Thus, in the OMCDi, doses of extracellular CA inhibitors that inhibited approximately 50% of CA IV activity also comparably inhibited HCO3- transport, indicating that H+ secretion depends in part on the availability of luminal CA IV activity. Acidosis substantially decreased the sensitivity of HCO3- transport to CA inhibition.

TI  - Effect of a lysine-enriched diet on L-lysine transport by the brush-border membrane of the chicken jejunum.  
AB  - The influx of L-lysine into apical vesicles from the chicken jejunum occurs through two systems, one with low Michaelis constant (K(m)) and features of system b0,+ and the other with relatively high K(m) for L-lysine and with properties of system y+. In the present study the effect of a lysine-enriched diet (Lys, containing 68 g L-lysine/kg dietary protein, control animals 48 g/kg) on L-lysine uptake through both transport systems was investigated. Results show that 1) lysine enrichment had no effect on either body weight or the efficiency of food utilization. 2) In Lys-fed animals, the mediated L-lysine influx was best fitted to the two-system model with y+ and b0,+ activity. 3) In the presence of an Na+ gradient, total L-lysine uptake is significantly higher in Lys-fed animals than in control birds (about 40% increase). 4) Lys diet increases K(m)b0,+ 6-fold (KSCN gradient) and 12-fold (NaSCN gradient) and maximum velocity (Vmax) by 6- and 20-fold, respectively. The effects of Lys enrichment on the y(+)-like system are only observed on the Vmax and in the presence of a Na+ gradient (30% increase). 5) Na+ is involved in the activation of the transport process in the Lys-fed chickens, but there is no correlation between external Na+ concentration and L-lysine influx. In conclusion, both b(0,+)- and y(+)-like transport systems are upregulated by dietary lysine but with different kinetic profiles; the high-capacity y(+)-like carrier shows a Vmax increase without changes in K(m), whereas the low-capacity b(0,+)-like system shows an increase in Vmax as well as in the K(m).

TI  - Opine catabolic loci from Agrobacterium plasmids confer chemotaxis to their cognate substrates.  
AB  - Opines are carbon compounds produced by crown galls and hairy roots induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes, respectively. These novel condensation products of plant metabolic intermediates are utilized as nutritional sources by the Agrobacterium strains that induced the growths. Thus, opines are thought to favor the propagation of agrobacteria in the tumorsphere. Certain Agrobacterium strains were chemoattracted to opines. The chemotactic activities to octopine, to nopaline, to mannopine, and to agrocinopines A + B were dependent on the type of the Ti plasmid present in the bacterium. The determinants for chemotaxis to these opines were localized to the regions of the octopine- and nopaline-type Ti plasmids coding for transport and catabolism of that opine. An insertion in accA, which encodes the periplasmic binding protein for agrocinopines A + B, abolished chemotaxis while an insertion in accC, which encodes a component of the transport system, and an insertion in accF, which encodes a function required for agrocinopine catabolism, did not affect chemotaxis to this opine. Thus, transport and catabolism of these opines are not required for the chemotactic activity. Analyses of subclones of the acc region confirmed that accA is the only gene required from the Ti plasmid for chemotaxis to agrocinopines A + B.

To investigate the coordinated functioning of the H+ extruders for m phi intracellular pH (pHi) regulation, we investigated the effects of the plant lectin concanavalin A (ConA) on resident alveolar m phi from rabbits. ConA (1 microM, 30-min pretreatment) activated the m phi for phagocytosis of opsonized Escherichia coli. ConA activation did not affect the baseline pHi of m phi or the initial rate of pHi recovery (dpHi/dt) from an intracellular acid load (acid-loaded pHi nadir approximately 6.9). However, the contributions of Na(+)-independent H+ transport (i.e. V-ATPase activity) and Na(+)-dependent H+ transport (i.e. NHE activity) to dpHi/dt were altered significantly. The lectin stimulated Na+/H+ exchange and inhibited V-ATPase activity. In control m phi, V-ATPase-mediated H+ extrusion was responsible for > 80% of dpHi/dt. Conversely, in ConA-treated m phi, Na+/H+ exchange was responsible for approximately 65% of dpHi/dt, and V-ATPase activity was responsible for only 35% of dpHi/dt. These results underscore the complex mechanisms and signaling pathways that coordinate the activities of cellular acid-base transporters in m phi pHi regulation.

TI  - Uptake of long chain fatty acids by human placental choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells: role of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein.  
AB  - In order to understand the mechanisms by which fatty acids are taken up by the placenta, the uptake of oleic, linoleic, arachidonic, and docosahexaenoic acids by cultured human placental choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells was examined. Fatty acid uptake by BeWo cells was temperature-dependent and exhibited saturable kinetics. Oleic acid was taken up least and docosahexaenoic acid most by these cells. Moreover, competitive studies of fatty acid uptake by BeWo cells also indicated preferential uptake compared with oleic acid in the order of docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid. Western blot analysis demonstrated that BeWo cells express a protein immunoreactive with antibodies to the human placental plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (p-FABPpm). Furthermore, pre-treatment of BeWo cells with these antibodies inhibited most of the uptake of docosahexaenoic (64%) and arachidonic acids (68%) whereas oleic acid uptake was inhibited only 32% compared with the controls treated with preimmune serum. These results clearly demonstrate that the pFABPpm may be involved in the preferential uptake of essential fatty acids (EFA) and their long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) by these cells. Studies on the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids in the cellular lipids of BeWo cells showed that docosahexaenoic acid was incorporated mainly in the triacylglycerol fraction, followed by the phospholipid fraction, whereas for arachidonic acid the reverse was true. The preferential incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into triacylglycerol suggests that triacylglycerol may play an important role in the placental transport of docosahexaenoic acid to the fetal circulation. Together these results demonstrate the preferential uptake of EFA/LCPUFA by BeWo cells that is most probably mediated via the pFABPpm. We thus propose that the p-FABPpm may be involved in the sequestration of maternal plasma LCPUFA by the placenta.

TI  - Modulation of bicarbonate secretion in rabbit duodenum: the role of calcium.  
AB  - Surface epithelial bicarbonate secretion protects the proximal duodenum from acid peptic injury. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium serve as intracellular mediators of intestinal transport. Experiments were performed to examine whether calcium participates in duodenal bicarbonate transport. Stripped duodenal mucosa from rabbits was studied in Ussing chambers. HCO3- transport was stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187, carbachol, vasoactive intestinal peptide, prostaglandin E2, dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and electrical field stimulation. A23187 stimulated HCO3- secretion and Isc; tetrodotoxin failed to inhibit this effect. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil abolished HCO3- secretion stimulated by carbachol, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and electrical field stimulation, but failed to alter basal, prostaglandin E2- or dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated HCO3- secretion. Therefore, calcium is likely required during stimulation of duodenal epithelial HCO3- transport by carbachol, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and electrical field stimulation. Prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate appear to activate duodenal HCO3- secretion by a calcium-independent pathway(s).

TI  - Oxidation of glutamine in HeLa cells: role and control of truncated TCA cycles in tumour mitochondria.  
AB  - The oxidative metabolism of glutamine in HeLa cells was investigated using intact cells and isolated mitochondria. The concentrations of the cytoplasmic amino acids were found to be aspartate, 8.0 mM; glutamate, 22.2 mM; glutamine, 11.3 mM; glycine, 9.8 mM; taurine, 2.3 mM; and alanine, < 1 mM. Incubation of the cells with [14C]glutamine gave steady-state recoveries of 14C-label (estimated as exogenous glutamine) in the glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate pools, of 103%, 80%, and 25%, respectively, indicating that glutamine synthetase activity was absent and that a significant proportion of glutamate oxidation proceeded through aspartate aminotransferase. No label was detected in the alanine pool, suggesting that alanine aminotransferase activity was low in these cells. The clearance rate of [14C]glutamine through the cellular compartment was 65 nmol/min per mg protein. There was a 28 s delay after [14C]glutamine was added to the cell before 14C-label was incorporated into the cytoplasm, while the formation of glutamate commenced 10 s later. Aspartate was the major metabolite formed when the mitochondria were incubated in a medium containing either glutamine, glutamate, or glutamate plus malate. The transaminase inhibitor AOA inhibited both aspartate efflux from the mitochondria and respiration. The addition of 2-oxoglutarate failed to relieve glutamate plus malate respiration, indicating that 2-oxoglutarate is part of a well-coupled truncated cycle, of which aspartate aminotransferase has been shown to be a component [Parlo and Coleman (1984): J Biol Chem 259:9997-10003]. This was confirmed by the observation that, although it inhibited respiration, AOA did not affect the efflux of citrate from the mitochondria. Thus citrate does not appear to be a cycle component and is directly transported to the medium. Therefore, it was concluded that the truncated TCA cycle in HeLa cells is the result of both a low rate of citrate synthesis and an active citrate transporter. DNP (10 microM) induced a state III-like respiration only in the presence of succinate, which supports the evidence that NAD-linked dehydrogenases were not coupled to respiration, and suggests that these mitochondria may have a defect in complex I of the electron transport chain. Arising from the present results with HeLa cells and results extant in the literature, it has been proposed that a major regulating mechanism for the flux of glutamate carbon in tumour cells is the competitive inhibition exerted by 2-oxoglutarate on aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. This has been discussed and applied to the data.

TI  - Juxtaglomerular cell complex in the regulation of renal salt excretion.  
AB  - Luminal NaCl concentration at the macula densa (MD) has the two established effects of regulating glomerular arteriolar resistance and renin secretion. Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), the inverse relationship between MD NaCl concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), stabilizes distal salt delivery and thereby NaCl excretion in response to random perturbations unrelated to changes in body salt balance. Control of vasomotor tone by TGF is exerted primarily by NaCl transport-dependent changes in local adenosine concentrations. During long-lasting perturbations of MD NaCl concentration, control of renin secretion becomes the dominant function of the MD. The potentially maladaptive effect of TGF under chronic conditions is prevented by TGF adaptations, permitting adjustments in GFR to occur. TGF adaptation is mechanistically coupled to the end point targeted by chronic deviations in MD NaCl, the rate of local and systemic angiotensin II generation. MD control of renin secretion is the result of the coordinated action of local mediators that include nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) products. Thus vascular smooth muscle cell activation during high MD transport and granular cell activation during low MD transport is achieved by different extracellular mediators. The coordinated regulation of NOS I and COX-2 expression in MD cells and of renin expression in granular cells suggests that control of juxtaglomerular regulation of gene transcription or mRNA metabolism may be another consequence of a chronic alteration in MD NaCl concentration.

TI  - A thiamine/H+ antiport mechanism for thiamine entry into brush border membrane vesicles from rat small intestine.  
AB  - Outwardly oriented H+ gradients greatly enhanced thiamine transport rate in brush border membrane vesicles from duodenal and jejunal mucosa of adult Wistar rats. At a gradient pHin5:pHout7.5, thiamine uptake showed an overshoot, which at 15 sec was three times as large as the uptake observed in the absence of the gradient. Under the same conditions, the binding component of uptake accounted for only 10-13% of intravesicular transport. At the same gradient, the Km and Jmax values of the saturable component of the thiamine uptake curve after a 6 sec incubation time were 6.2 +/- 1.4 microM and 14.9 +/- 3 pmol.mg-1 protein.6 sec-1 respectively. These values were about 3 and 5 times higher, respectively, than those recorded in the absence of H+ gradient. The saturable component of the thiamine antiport had a stoichiometric thiamine: H+ ratio of 1:1 and was inhibited by thiamine analogues, guanidine, guanidine derivatives, inhibitors of the guanidine/H+ antiport, and imipramine. Conversely, the guanidine/H+ antiport was inhibited by unlabeled thiamine and thiamine analogues; omeprazole caused an approximately fourfold increase in thiamine transport rate. In the absence of H+ gradient, changes in transmembrane electrical potential did not affect thiamine uptake. At equilibrium, the percentage membrane-bound thiamine taken up was positively correlated with the pH of the incubation medium, and increased from about 10% at pH 5 to 99% at pH 9.

TI  - Brownian dynamics study of ion transport in the vestibule of membrane channels.  
AB  - Brownian dynamics simulations have been carried out to study the transport of ions in a vestibular geometry, which offers a more realistic shape for membrane channels than cylindrical tubes. Specifically, we consider a torus-shaped channel, for which the analytical solution of Poisson's equation is possible. The system is composed of the toroidal channel, with length and radius of the constricted region of 80 A and 4 A, respectively, and two reservoirs containing 50 sodium ions and 50 chloride ions. The positions of each of these ions executing Brownian motion under the influence of a stochastic force and a systematic electric force are determined at discrete time steps of 50 fs for up to 2.5 ns. All of the systematic forces acting on an ion due to the other ions, an external electric field, fixed charges in the channel protein, and the image charges induced at the water-protein boundary are explicitly included in the calculations. We find that the repulsive dielectric force arising from the induced surface charges plays a dominant role in channel dynamics. It expels an ion from the vestibule when it is deliberately put in it. Even in the presence of an applied electric potential of 100 mV, an ion cannot overcome this repulsive force and permeate the channel. Only when dipoles of a favorable orientation are placed along the sides of the transmembrane segment can an ion traverse the channel under the influence of a membrane potential. When the strength of the dipoles is further increased, an ion becomes detained in a potential well, and the driving force provided by the applied field is not sufficient to drive the ion out of the well. The trajectory of an ion navigating across the channel mostly remains close to the central axis of the pore lumen. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the transport of ions across the membrane.

TI  - Identification of components of trans-Golgi network-derived transport vesicles and detergent-insoluble complexes by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry.  
AB  - Epithelial cells have to deliver newly synthesized proteins to the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane domains of the polarized cell surface. Sorting takes place in the trans-Golgi network and at least two vesicular carriers exist for apical and basolateral delivery. After immuno-isolation, the composition of these vesicle preparations was analyzed by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and detergent extraction. In this paper we compare the constituents of detergent-insoluble complexes in different cell lines of polarized or nonpolarized origin and present the identification of five previously uncharacterized proteins. We show that our protein identification strategy can be successfully applied to the problem of small hydrophobic proteins from organisms that have not been substantially sequenced. The high sensitivity of nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry allowed us to identify two proteins that belong to the p23/p24 family of putative cargo receptors for vesicular trafficking. Furthermore we have mapped CD9 and CD81, two members of a large family of proteins consisting of highly hydrophobic four transmembrane proteins. In addition we have identified caveolin-2 as a constituent of basolateral transport vesicles. We have also extended our analysis of immuno-isolated vesicles to a more basic pI range and show that this region on 2-D gels is devoid of proteins. With these approaches and with the previously published data we have now identified most of the major low molecular weight proteins recovered in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes.

TI  - Separation of early steps in endocytic membrane transport.  
AB  - We describe a simple subcellular fractionation scheme aimed at separating early endosomes from the plasma membrane in view of studying the possible arrival of plasma membrane-bound toxins, proteins or other extracellular ligands in endosomes. Plasma membrane proteins were labeled with the impermeable reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (NHS-LC) biotin at 4 degrees C. In a separate set of cells, early endosomes were labeled by internalization of horseradish peroxidase from the medium for 5 min. The first step of the purification, which consists of a step sucrose gradient, led to three fractions, respectively: enriched in biosynthetic membranes (interface 3), in plasma membrane and early endosomes (interface 2), and in late endosomes (interface 1). The second step, in which interface 2 was loaded at the bottom of a 17% Percoll gradient, led to the separation of the plasma membrane, including caveolae and cholesterol-glycolipid rafts, from early endosomes. Western blot analysis of the fractions from the Percoll gradient showed that the transferrin receptor, the small GTPases rab5 and Arf6, as well as annexin II were present both at the plasma membrane and in early endosomes, whereas the caveolar marker caveolin, 1co, migrated only with the biotinylated plasma membrane proteins. We used this fractionation procedure to show that the pore-forming toxin aerolysin does not reach the endocytic compartments of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The procedure should be generally useful in rapidly determining whether extracellular proteins or ligands reach endosomes.

TI  - Genetics of renal mechanisms of primary hypertension: the role of adducin.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To summarize data concerning the identification of adducin as a 'candidate' gene in the Milan hypertensive strain of rats (MHS), a genetic model of essential hypertension, and in human essential hypertension. RESULTS: The sequence of events from renal function to cell membrane ion transports and finally to the molecular defect has been established in MHS rats. This led to the identification of polymorphisms in the cytoskeletal protein adducin. These polymorphisms are involved in blood pressure regulation in these rats. A linkage and an association study on Caucasian populations support the involvement of adducin in human hypertension also. A polymorphism of alpha-adducin gene is significantly associated with human hypertension. In particular, both in humans and in rats, adducin polymorphisms affect kidney function by modulating the overall capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport ions. CONCLUSIONS: Adducin polymorphisms account for only a portion of hypertension both in humans and rats. Therefore additive or epistatic interactions with other genes involved in renal sodium handling need to be studied.

TI  - Regulation of the glial Na+-dependent glutamate transporters by cyclic AMP analogs and neurons.  
AB  - Sodium-dependent transport into astrocytes is critical for maintaining the extracellular concentrations of glutamate below toxic levels in the central nervous system. In this study, the expression of the glial glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST was studied in primary cultures derived from cortical tissue. In primary astrocytes, GLAST protein levels were approximately one half of those observed in cortical tissue, but GLT-1 protein was present at very low levels compared with cortical tissue. Maintenance of these astrocytes in medium supplemented with dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP) caused a dramatic change in cell morphology, increased GLT-1 and GLAST mRNA levels approximately 5-fold, increased GLAST protein approximately 2-fold, and increased GLT-1 protein >/=8-20-fold. These increases in protein expression were accompanied by 2-fold increases in the Vmax and Km values for Na+-dependent L-[3H]glutamate transport activity. Although GLT-1 is sensitive to inhibition by dihydrokainate in heterologous expression systems, no dihydrokainate sensitivity was observed in astrocyte cultures that expressed GLT-1. Biotinylation with a membrane-impermeant reagent, separation of the biotinylated/cell surface proteins, and subsequent Western blotting demonstrated that both GLT-1 and GLAST were present at the cell surface. Coculturing of astrocytes with neurons also induced expression of GLT-1, which colocalized with the glial specific marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. Neurons induced a small increase in GLAST protein. Several studies were performed to examine the mechanism by which neurons regulate expression of the glial transporters. Three different protein kinase A (PKA) antagonists did not block the effect of neurons on glial expression of GLT-1 protein, but the addition of dbcAMP to mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes did not cause GLT-1 protein to increase further. This suggests that neurons do not regulate GLT-1 by activation of PKA but that neurons and dbcAMP regulate GLT-1 protein through convergent pathways. As was observed with GLT-1, the increases in GLAST protein observed in cocultures were not blocked by PKA antagonists, but unlike GLT-1, the addition of dbcAMP to mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes caused GLAST protein to increase approximately 2-fold. Neurons separated from astrocytes with a semipermeable membrane increased GLT-1 protein, indicating that the effect of neurons was mediated by a diffusible molecule. Treatment of cocultures with high concentrations of either N-methyl-D-aspartate or glutamate killed the neurons, caused GLT-1 protein to decrease, and caused GLAST protein to increase. These studies suggest that GLT-1 and GLAST protein are regulated independently in astrocyte cultures and that a diffusible molecule secreted by neurons induces expression of GLT-1 in astrocytes.

TI  - Mechanism of prostaglandin E2 transport across the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes expressing the prostaglandin transporter "PGT".  
AB  - We recently identified a novel prostaglandin transporter called PGT (Kanai, N., Lu, R., Satriano, J. A., Bao, Y., Wolkoff, A. W., and Schuster, V. L. (1995) Science 268, 866-869). Based on initial functional studies, we have hypothesized that PGT might mediate the release of newly synthesized prostaglandins (PG), epithelial transport of PGs, or metabolic clearance of PGs. Here we examined the mechanism of PGT transport as expressed in HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes, using isotopic PG influx and efflux studies. In both native HeLa cells and oocytes, cell membranes were poorly permeable to PGs. In contrast, in oocytes injected with PGT mRNA, the PG influx permeability coefficient was 90-157 times that of oocytes injected with water. The rank order substrate profile was PGF2alpha approximately PGE2 > TXB2 >> 6 keto-PGF1alpha. PG influx displayed an overshoot with rapid accumulation of tracer PGE2, followed by a gradual return to baseline. Based on estimated oocyte volumes, the PGT-mediated accumulation of PGE2 reached steady state at intra-oocyte concentrations 25-fold higher than the external media. The accumulation of PG was not due to intracellular binding or metabolism. PGT-mediated uptake was ATP- and temperature-dependent, but not sodium-dependent, and was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes, niflumic acid, and the thiol reactive anion MTSES (Na(2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate). [3H]PGE2 efflux from PGT-transfected HeLa cells was stimulated by external (trans) PGE2 in a dose-dependent fashion and was inhibited by bromcresol green and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. Membrane depolarization inhibited uptake of [3H]PGE2, consistent with a model of net outward movement of negative charge during the translocation event. These findings suggest that PGT mediates [3H]PGE2 accumulation via obligatory, electrogenic anion exchange.

TI  - Light-driven production of ATP catalysed by F0F1-ATP synthase in an artificial photosynthetic membrane.  
AB  - Energy-transducing membranes of living organisms couple spontaneous to non-spontaneous processes through the intermediacy of protonmotive force (p.m.f.)--an imbalance in electrochemical potential of protons across the membrane. In most organisms, p.m.f. is generated by redox reactions that are either photochemically driven, such as those in photosynthetic reaction centres, or intrinsically spontaneous, such as those of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Transmembrane proteins (such as the cytochromes and complexes I, III and IV in the electron-transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane) couple the redox reactions to proton translocation, thereby conserving a fraction of the redox chemical potential as p.m.f. Many transducer proteins couple p.m.f. to the performance of biochemical work, such as biochemical synthesis and mechanical and transport processes. Recently, an artificial photosynthetic membrane was reported in which a photocyclic process was used to transport protons across a liposomal membrane, resulting in acidification of the liposome's internal volume. If significant p.m.f. is generated in this system, then incorporating an appropriate transducer into the liposomal bilayer should make it possible to drive a non-spontaneous chemical process. Here we report the incorporation of F0F1-ATP synthase into liposomes containing the components of the proton-pumping photocycle. Irradiation of this artificial membrane with visible light results in the uncoupler- and inhibitor-sensitive synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) against an ATP chemical potential of approximately 12 kcal mol(-1), with a quantum yield of more than 7%. This system mimics the process by which photosynthetic bacteria convert light energy into ATP chemical potential.

TI  - Stealth PLA-PEG nanoparticles as protein carriers for nasal administration.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to encapsulate a model protein antigen, tetanus toxoid (TT), within hydrophobic (PLA) and surface hydrophilic (PLA-PEG) nanoparticles and to evaluate the potential of these colloidal carriers for the transport of proteins through the nasal mucosa. METHODS: TT-loaded nanoparticles, prepared by a modified water-in-oil-in-water solvent evaporation technique, were characterized in their size, zeta potential and hydrophobicity. Nanoparticles were also assayed in vitro for their ability to deliver active antigen for extended periods of time. Finally, 125I-TT-loaded nanoparticles were administered intranasally to rats and the amount of radioactivity recovered in the blood compartment, lymph nodes and other relevant tissues was monitored for up to 48 h. RESULTS: PLA and PLA-PEG nanoparticles had a similar particle size (137-156 nm) and negative surface charge, but differed in their surface hydrophobicity: PLA were more hydrophobic than PLA-PEG nanoparticles. PLA-PEG nanoparticles, especially those containing gelatine as an stabilizer, provided extended delivery of the active protein.  The transport of the radiolabeled protein through the rat nasal mucosa was highly affected by the surface properties of the nanoparticles: PLA-PEG nanoparticles led to a much greater penetration of TT into the blood circulation and the lymph nodes than PLA nanoparticles. Furthermore, after administration of 125I-TT-loaded PLA-PEG nanoparticles, it was found that a high amount of radioactivity persisted in the blood compartment for at least 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: A novel nanoparticulate system has been developed with excellent characteristics for the transport of proteins through the nasal mucosa.

Analysis of the heat capacity increment of these reactions showed that approximately 50-60 residues are involved in the binding of mannitol and perseitol, but far less in the phosphorylated state or after removal of the B domain. A model is proposed in which binding of mannitol leads to the formation of a contact interface between the two domains, either by folding of unstructured parts or by docking of preexisting surfaces, thus positioning the incoming mannitol close to the phosphorylation site on the B domain to facilitate the transfer of the phosphoryl group.

TI  - Molybdate binding by ModA, the periplasmic component of the Escherichia coli mod molybdate transport system.  
AB  - ModA, the periplasmic-binding protein of the Escherichia coli mod transport system was overexpressed and purified. Binding of molybdate and tungstate to ModA was found to modify the UV absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the protein. Titration of these changes showed that ModA binds molybdate and tungstate in a 1:1 molar ratio. ModA showed an intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum attributable to its three tryptophanyl residues. Molybdate binding caused a conformational change in the protein characterized by: (i) a shift of tryptophanyl groups to a more hydrophobic environment; (ii) a quenching (at pH 5.0) or enhancement (at pH 7.8) of fluorescence; and (iii) a higher availability of tryptophanyl groups to the polar quencher acrylamide. The tight binding of molybdate did not allow an accurate estimation of the binding constants by these indirect methods. An isotopic binding method with 99MoO42- was used for accurate determination of KD (20 nM) and stoichiometry (1:1 molar ratio). ModA bound tungstate with approximately the same affinity, but did not bind sulfate or phosphate. These KDs are 150- to 250-fold lower than those previously reported, and compatible with the high molybdate transport affinity of the mod system. The affinity of ModA for molybdate was also determined in vivo and found to be similar to that determined in vitro. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

CONCLUSIONS: The acute alteration of axoplasmic ultrastructures in some parts of the optic nerves at the level of the lamina cribrosa involves a decrease in the amount of MAP 1 and a decrease in the number of axonal cross-bridges on microtubules in a condition of acutely increased IOP, which could be related to microtubule instability and abnormal organelle transport in the axoplasm.

TI  - Ultrastructural changes and immunocytochemical localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 in guinea pig optic nerves after acute increase in intraocular pressure.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate ultrastructural changes and localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP 1) in optic nerves of guinea pigs in conditions of acute increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS: Intraocular pressure was increased acutely in 40 guinea pig eyes, and 40 eyes were examined in 20 normal control animals. Analytic methods included quick-freezing and deep-etching (QF-DE) and conventional fixation. Microtubule-associated protein 1 immunocytochemistry was performed. RESULTS: In conventional ultrathin sections, an alteration of the axoplasmic ultrastructure was seen only at the level of the lamina cribrosa sclerae. The number of microtubules was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that exhibited accumulations of membranous organelles. Cross-bridged filaments on microtubules were significantly reduced in number when determined by the QF-DE method. The immunostaining of tubulin or MAP 1 was less positive than in other samples with normal IOP, revealed by light microscopic immunocytochemistry. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that MAP 1 was significantly decreased in the axoplasm that showed accumulations of membranous organelles. CONCLUSIONS: The acute alteration of axoplasmic ultrastructures in some parts of the optic nerves at the level of the lamina cribrosa involves a decrease in the amount of MAP 1 and a decrease in the number of axonal cross-bridges on microtubules in a condition of acutely increased IOP, which could be related to microtubule instability and abnormal organelle transport in the axoplasm.

TI  - Functional expression of P-glycoprotein in the hepatic canalicular membrane of developing rats [published erratum appears in J Pharm Sci 1998 Jun;87(6):785]  
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the multidrug resistance gene product, is expressed in a normal liver exclusively on the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of age on the P-gp transport system using canalicular membrane (cLPM) vesicles isolated from the liver of developing (22 days old) and adult rats. No differences in protein yield, intravesicular volumes, and enrichments of cLPM enzymes or enzymes representing contamination of subcellular organelles were found for vesicles isolated from both groups, demonstrating the isolation of similar cLPM vesicle preparations. The transport of daunomycin (DNM), a P-gp substrate, was used to study age-related functional differences in P-gp. DNM uptake in the presence of ATP was greater than uptake in the absence of ATP in both young and adult cLPM vesicles, showing that P-gp is functional in both groups. In young and adult groups only ATP was a potent stimulator of transport when compared with ATP degradation products and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. Although ATP-dependent uptake tended to be greater in the adult compared to the young, there was no statistically significant difference in DNM kinetics (Vmax, km, gamma) between groups. Canalicular membrane from the young rats showed decreased fluidity, as assessed by the fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; however there was no significant difference between groups. Examination of P-gp expression using the monoclonal antibody C219 revealed similar levels of expression in the young as in the adult. Our results suggest that P-gp in the bile canaliculus of developing rats is functional with similar levels of function and expression as observed in the adult.

TI  - In vitro blood-brain barrier permeability of nevirapine compared to other HIV antiretroviral agents.  
AB  - To combat infection and inhibit viral replication of HIV in the brain, antiretroviral agents must cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). An in vitro BBB model consisting of bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells grown on porous filters was used to study and compare the transport of nevirapine, a potent and selective nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with other HIV antiretroviral agents currently in use for the treatment of HIV infection. These included nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (didanosine, stavudine, zalcitabine, zidovudine), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (delaviridine), and protease inhibitors (indinavir, saquinavir, VX-478). Nevirapine was the most permeable antiretroviral agent studied in the BBB model. The order of in vitro BBB permeability was nevirapine >> VX-478 > didanosine, stavudine, zalcitabine, zidovudine > indinavir > saquinavir. There was an apparent bell-shaped relationship between in vitro BBB permeability and octanol/phosphate-buffered saline distribution coefficient (D) where all lipophilic (log D > 2.5) as well as hydrophilic (log D < -0.5) antiretrovirals were less permeable than nevirapine (log D = 1.8). There were no significant effects on the in vitro BBB permeability of nevirapine in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Saquinavir was the only drug shown to have an affinity for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, which may have contributed to its very low permeability. The apparent ability of nevirapine to readily permeate the BBB and enter the brain, where it may inhibit replication of HIV, potentially increases its therapeutic value.

TI  - Dip5p mediates high-affinity and high-capacity transport of L-glutamate and L-aspartate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  
AB  - Genes encoding homologues of known amino-acid permeases were deleted in a strain also deficient in the general amino-acid permease. The uptake capacity of the mutants was investigated for several L-alpha-amino acids. Deletion of a gene denoted DIP5 results in the loss of L-aspartate and L-glutamate uptake. The dip5 mutation caused a several hundred-fold reduction of uptake of the two amino acids, both in cells grown on proline as a nitrogen source and in cells grown on ammonium. DIP5-dependent uptake of L-aspartate and L-glutamate was somewhat lower in ammonium-grown cells than in proline-grown cells. Transcriptional regulation is at least partially responsible for this difference, as shown by assaying the DIP5 promoter fused to lacZ. This suggests that the promoter is subject to nitrogen catabolite repression. Transport of a few other amino acids was moderately affected by dip5 but was not competed by L-aspartate in the DIP5 parental strain; transport of these amino acids is therefore unlikely to be mediated by Dip5p. Our results suggest that DIP5 encodes an amino-acid permease with a high transport capacity and a high affinity for L-glutamate and L-aspartate, with a Kt of about 50 microM for both.

TI  - Role of nucleoside transport and purine release in a rabbit model of myocardial stunning.  
AB  - Previously, we have demonstrated the role of nucleoside transport and purine release in post-ischemic reperfusion injury (myocardial stunning) in several canine models of ischemia. Since rabbits are deficient of xanthine oxidase, it is not known whether selective blockade of purine release is beneficial in a rabbit model of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion (stunning). Therefore, we determined the hemodynamic and metabolic correlates in response to myocardial stunning in the presence or absence of selective nucleoside transport blocker (p-nitrobenzylthioinosine, NBMPR) and adenosine deaminase inhibitor (erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, EHNA). Sixty adult anaesthetized rabbits were surgically prepared for hemodynamic measurements. After stabilization period, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 15 min and reperfused for 30 min. Transmural myocardial biopsies were obtained from the ischemic LAD area and from the non-ischemic posterior (circumflex, CFX) segment of the myocardium. Rabbits (n = 60) were randomly assigned to either the control or the EHNA/NBMPR-treated group (n = 30 each). Each group was further divided to either functional or metabolic groups (n = 15 each subgroup). Each animal received intravenously 30 ml of either a vehicle solution or 100 M EHNA and 25 M NBMPR 10 min before ischemia. Although administration of EHNA/NBMPR did not affect the heart rate, it did cause mild hypotension (about 20-30%). Fifteen minutes of LAD occlusion resulted in significant ATP depletion and concomitant accumulation of nucleosides in both groups (p < 0.05 vs. baseline and non-ischemic CFX segment). AMP was higher in the LAD compared to the CFX segment. Significant accumulation of adenosine was observed in the treated group compared to the control group. It is concluded that EHNA/NBMPR induced site specific entrapment of adenosine of nucleoside transport in the rabbit heart, in vivo.

TI  - Fatty acid transport: difficult or easy?  
AB  - Transport of unesterified fatty acids (FA) into cells has been viewed either as a simple diffusion process regulated mainly by lipid physical chemistry or as a more complex process involving protein catalysis. In this review FA transport in cell membranes is broken down into three essential steps: adsorption, transmembrane movement, and desorption. The physical properties of FA in aqueous, membrane, and protein environments relevant to transport mechanisms are discussed, with emphasis on recent information derived from NMR and fluorescence studies. Because of their low solubility in water and high hydrophobicity, FA bind rapidly and avidly to model membranes (phospholipid bilayers); if albumin is a donor, FA desorb rapidly to reach their equilibrium distribution between the membrane and albumin. The ionization properties of FA in a phospholipid bilayer result in a high population of the un-ionized form (approximately 50%) at pH 7.4, which diffuses across the lipid bilayer (flip-flops) rapidly (t(1/2) < 1 sec). Desorption of FA from a phospholipid surface is slower than transmembrane movement and dependent on the FA chain length and unsaturation, but is rapid for typical dietary FA. These physical properties of FA in model systems predict that proteins are not essential for transport of FA through membranes. The only putative FA transport protein to be purified and reconstituted into phospholipid bilayers, the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP1), was shown to transport the FA anion in response to FA flip-flop. New experiments with cells have found that FA movement into cells acidifies the cytosol, as predicted by the flip-flop model.

TI  - Adenosine and hypoxanthine transport in horse erythrocytes: evidence for a polymorphism in the transport of hypoxanthine via a sodium-dependent cotransporter.  
AB  - The inward transport of two purines, adenosine and hypoxanthine, at 37 degrees C by horse erythrocytes was compared. No mediated transport of adenosine was detected in horse erythrocytes, nor was saturable, high-affinity binding of the potent facilitated-diffusion inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine demonstrable in horse erythrocyte membranes. In contrast, erythrocytes from most horses possessed a saturable sodium-dependent hypoxanthine transporter (apparent K(m), 100 +/- 28 microM; Vmax, 0.20 +/- 0.08 mmol (l cells)-1 h-1; means +/- S.E.M., n = 5). Guanine inhibited hypoxanthine influx (apparent Ki, 24 +/- 6 microM), but adenine and xanthine had no effect. Unlike human erythrocytes, no sodium-independent hypoxanthine transporter was detected in horse erythrocytes. There are, however, a small number of animals (approximately 15%) whose erythrocytes fail to transport hypoxanthine. This variation appears to be under genetic control, but the precise nature of the control is unknown.

TI  -  Glutamine transport by the blood-brain barrier: a possible mechanism for nitrogen removal.  
AB  - Glutamine and glutamate transport activities were measured in isolated luminal and abluminal plasma membrane vesicles derived from bovine brain endothelial cells. Facilitative systems for glutamine and glutamate were almost exclusively located in luminal-enriched membranes. The facilitative glutamine carrier was neither sensitive to 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid inhibition nor did it participate in accelerated amino acid exchange; it therefore appeared to be distinct from the neutral amino acid transport system L1. Two Na-dependent glutamine transporters were found in abluminal-enriched membranes: systems A and N. System N accounted for approximately 80% of Na-dependent glutamine transport at 100 microM. Abluminal-enriched membranes showed Na-dependent glutamate transport activity. The presence of 1) Na-dependent carriers capable of pumping glutamine and glutamate from brain into endothelial cells, 2) glutaminase within endothelial cells to hydrolyze glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, and 3) facilitative carriers for glutamine and glutamate at the luminal membrane may provide a mechanism for removing nitrogen and nitrogen-rich amino acids from brain.

TI  - Time-dependent stimulation by aldosterone of blocker-sensitive ENaCs in A6 epithelia.  
AB  - To study and define the early time-dependent response (< or = 6 h) of blocker-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) to stimulation of Na+ transport by aldosterone, we used a new modified method of blocker-induced noise analysis to determine the changes of single-channel current (iNa) channel open probability (Po), and channel density (NT) under transient conditions of transport as measured by macroscopic short-circuit currents (Isc). In three groups of experiments in which spontaneous baseline rates of transport averaged 1.06, 5.40, and 15.14 microA/cm2, stimulation of transport occurred due to increase of blocker-sensitive channels. NT varied linearly over a 70-fold range of transport (0.5-35 microA/cm2). Relatively small and slow time-dependent but aldosterone-independent decreases of Po occurred during control (10-20% over 2 h) and aldosterone experimental periods (10-30% over 6 h). When the Po of control and aldosterone-treated tissues was examined over the 70-fold extended range of Na+ transport, Po was observed to vary inversely with Isc, falling from approximately 0.5 to approximately 0.15 at the highest rates of Na+ transport or approximately 25% per 3-fold increase of transport. Because decreases of Po from any source cannot explain stimulation of transport by aldosterone, it is concluded that the early time-dependent stimulation of Na+ transport in A6 epithelia is due exclusively to increase of apical membrane NT.

TI  - Cardiac myocyte calcium transport in phospholamban knockout mouse: relaxation and endogenous CaMKII effects.  
AB  - Increases in heart rate are accompanied by acceleration of relaxation. This effect is apparent at the single myocyte level and depends on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca transport and Ca/calmodulin dependent protein kinase [CaMKII; see R. A. Bassani, A. Mattiazzi, and D. M. Bers. Am. J. Physiol. 268 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 37): H703-H712, 1995]. Because phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) by CaMKII can stimulate SR Ca transport, it is a plausible candidate mechanism. We examined this issue using ventricular myocytes isolated from wild-type (WT) mice and those in which the PLB gene was ablated by gene targeting (PLB-KO). During steady-state (SS) stimulation, twitch relaxation and intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]i) decline were significantly faster than after a rest in both WT and PLB-KO myocytes. Furthermore, the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1 microM) abolished the stimulation-dependent acceleration of twitch [Ca]i decline in PLB-KO. This indicates that neither PLB nor its phosphorylation are required for the CaMKII-dependent acceleration of the SS twitch [Ca]i decline and relaxation. Other quantitative aspects of Ca transport in WT and PLB-KO myocytes were also examined. As expected, the time constant (tau) of [Ca]i decline during the SS twitch is much faster in PLB-KO than in WT myocytes (112 +/- 6 vs. 188 +/- 14 ms, P < 0.0001). There was also an increase in SS SR Ca load, based on the change of [Ca]i during rapid caffeine-induced contractures (CafC) with Na/Ca exchange blocked (565 +/- 74 nM for WT, 1118 +/- 133 nM for PLB-KO, P < 0.01). Accounting for cytosolic Ca buffering, this implies a 37% increase in SR Ca content. The tau for [Ca]i decline of the cafC with Na present indicated slower extrusion by Na/Ca exchange in the PLB-KO mouse (2.2 +/- 0.2 s in WT vs. 3.2 +/- 0.2 in PLB-KO, P < 0.01), although exchanger protein expression was unchanged. Integrated Ca flux analysis in WT and PLB-KO myocytes, respectively, shows that 90 and 96% of Ca during twitch relaxation is removed by the SR Ca-ATPase, 9 and 3.4% by Na/Ca exchange, and 0.5 and 0.1% by slow mechanisms (mitochondria Ca uniporter and sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase). We conclude that the PLB-KO myocytes retain a CaMKII-dependent acceleration of SS twitch [Ca]i decline. The PLB-KO (vs. WT) myocytes also have higher SR Ca pump activity, higher SR Ca load, and reduced Na/Ca exchange activity.

TI  - Dexamethasone treatment and plasma glucose levels: relevance for fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake measurements in gliomas.  
AB  - Dexamethasone (DEX) is frequently used in brain tumor management. This study investigated the effect of DEX treatment and plasma glucose levels on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in patients with malignant gliomas (16 glioblastoma, 3 anaplastic astrocytoma). METHODS: Fifteen DEX-treated patients (mean relative dose 0.23 +/- 0.15 mg(-1) x kg(-1) x day(-1), range 0.07-0.53), four patients not treated with DEX and nine healthy subjects were studied using PET and FDG. PET data obtained from tumors and the contralateral cortex were fitted to a standard two-tissue compartment model.  The FDG transport and phosphorylation rates, distribution volume (DV), steady-state accumulation (Ki), deoxyglucose metabolism (R), plasma volume as well as standardized uptake values (SUVs) and tumor-to-brain ratios were determined. In addition, the tumor size was estimated from the maximal area of contrast-enhancing tumor on computed cranial tomography (CCT) scans or MRI. RESULTS: FDG uptake was depressed in the contralateral cortex of patients and was related to tumor size. With increasing relative DEX dose, a decrease in the DV of tumors (linear regression p = 0.021) and in the DV (p = 0.109) and plasma volume (p = 0.010) of contralateral cortex was found. R, Ki and SUVs in tumors and contralateral cortex were not related to the relative DEX dose. With increasing plasma glucose levels, differential decreases in Ki and SUVs in tumors (p = 0.057 and p = 0.733, respectively) and contralateral cortex (p = 0.001 and p = 0.029, respectively) were observed. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that DEX affects FDG uptake in malignant gliomas through interaction with cerebral blood vessels and extracellular space, whereas FDG metabolism in tumors is not influenced substantially. This is of practical importance for patients having serial brain tumor imaging for treatment evaluation because patients may receive different DEX doses at different time points in the course of their disease. By contrast, the plasma glucose level must be considered a confounding variable when SUVs, tumor-to-brain ratios or Ki are used for treatment evaluation.

TI  - Initial docking of ER-derived vesicles requires Uso1p and Ypt1p but is independent of SNARE proteins.  
AB  -  ER-to-Golgi transport in yeast may be reproduced in vitro with washed membranes, purified proteins (COPII, Uso1p and LMA1) and energy. COPII coated vesicles that have budded from the ER are freely diffusible but then dock to Golgi membranes upon the addition of Uso1p. LMA1 and Sec18p are required for vesicle fusion after Uso1p function. Here, we report that the docking reaction is sensitive to excess levels of Sec19p (GDI), a treatment that removes the GTPase, Ypt1p. Once docked, however, vesicle fusion is no longer sensitive to GDI. In vitro binding experiments demonstrate that the amount of Uso1p associated with membranes is reduced when incubated with GDI and correlates with the level of membrane-bound Ypt1p, suggesting that this GTPase regulates Uso1p binding to membranes. To determine the influence of SNARE proteins on the vesicle docking step, thermosensitive mutations in Sed5p, Bet1p, Bos1p and Sly1p that prevent ER-to-Golgi transport in vitro at restrictive temperatures were employed. These mutations do not interfere with Uso1p-mediated docking, but block membrane fusion. We propose that an initial vesicle docking event of ER-derived vesicles, termed tethering, depends on Uso1p and Ypt1p but is independent of SNARE proteins.

TI  - [Improvement of intestinal absorption of peptide and protein drugs by chemical modification with fatty acids]  
AB  - It is well known that the oral bioavailability of peptide and protein drugs is generally poor because they are extensively degraded by proteases in the gastrointestinal tract and impermeable through the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, various approaches have been examined to overcome the delivery problems of these peptides and to improve their absorption via the gastrointestinal tract. Of these approaches, a potentially useful approach to solve these delivery problems may be chemical modification of peptides and proteins to produce prodrugs and analogues. Thus, it is plausible that this approach may protect peptides against degradation by peptidases and other enzymes present at the mucosal barrier and renders the peptides and proteins more lipophilic, resulting in increased bioavailability. From these standpoints, we synthesized lipophilic derivatives of peptides and proteins such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), tetragastrin (TG), calcitonin and insulin by chemical modification with fatty acids. The pharmacological activities of these derivatives were relatively high as compared with the native peptides. A significant increase in the intestinal absorption of these derivatives of peptides was observed in comparison with native peptides. Overall, the effects of acylation on the intestinal absorption of these peptides were more predominant in the large intestine than those in the small intestine. In addition, these derivatives were more stable than the parent peptides in homogenates of the various intestinal mucosae. We also examined the intestinal transport characteristics of TG and its acyl derivatives using Caco-2 cell monolayers in order to assess the contribution of enzymatic and transport barriers on their intestinal absorption. The degradation clearance of TG on the apical membrane was decreased by chemical modification with fatty acids. In addition, the permeability clearance of TG was improved by the acylation. On the other hand, the intestinal absorption of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is transported by a carrier-mediated process, was also enhanced by chemical modification with lauric acid. In summary, this chemical modification approach may be useful to improve the intestinal absorption of peptide and protein drugs.

TI  - Assessment of glucosylifosfamide mustard biodistribution in rats with prostate adenocarcinomas by means of in vivo 31P NMR and in vitro uptake experiments.  
AB  - A combined in vitro/in vivo study was performed to evaluate the possible application of phosphorus (31P) NMR spectroscopy for therapy monitoring and to investigate glucosylifosfamide mustard (Glc-IPM) transport and biodistribution by radiotracer techniques. Dynamic in vivo 31P NMR measurements were performed in rats with prostate adenocarcinoma after i.v. injection of 1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) of ifosfamide (IFO) (n = 4) and 1 mmol/kg bw (n = 4) or 2.15 mmol/kg bw (n = 9) of Glc-IPM. In a biodistribution study with 14C-labeled Glc-IPM and a final dose of 0.8 mmol Glc-IPM/kg bw, the animals were killed 5, 30, 60, and 120 min after drug administration, an ethanol extraction was performed from several tissues, and the dose per g tissue was calculated. The same tumor cell line was used in saturation and competition experiments to further elucidate the transport mechanism. The 31P NMR signals of IFO and Glc-IPM showed no overlap with the endogenous phosphorus peaks. A rapid washout with a half-life between 25.9 +/- 5.6 min for the lower dose and 34.3 +/- 4.2 min for the higher dose of Glc-IPM was observed in the tumor. No statistically significant change of the pH value was observed during the examination period. The beta-nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP)/inorganic phosphate (Pi) signal intensity ratio showed a tendency to decrease but without statistical significance. A rapid elimination was demonstrated by both the noninvasive NMR technique and the biodistribution study. No saturation was found in vitro for the Glc-IPM uptake, even at the concentration of 5 mM. Furthermore, the Glc-IPM uptake was not inhibited by the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and vice versa. The data show that the pharmacokinetics of Glc-IPM in the tumor can be followed in vivo by 31P NMR. The results presented are evidence for diffusion as the transport mechanism for Glc-IPM in this tumor model. However, the better visualization of Glc-IPM as compared to ifosfamide may be due to metabolic trapping of a negatively charged metabolite after deglycosylation.

TI  - Nicotine transport in a human choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR).  
AB  - Smoking is a major health problem in pregnancy resulting in intrauterine growth retardation and birth complications. Nicotine, a toxic component of cigarette smoke, interferes with amino acid transport in the placenta and stimulates catecholamine release resulting in uteroplacental vasoconstriction.  Transplacental transport of nicotine may be an important determinant of placental and fetal exposure. Our aim was to determine the mechanism of nicotine transport in the human choriocarcinoma cell line, JAR, as a model for the placenta. JAR cells were subcultured in 12-well plates following trypsinization at a seeding density of 0.5 x 10(6) cells/well (1.3 x 10(5) cells/cm2). Uptake studies of [3H]nicotine were carried out in JAR cell monolayers on day 2 after plating. [3H]Nicotine uptake was saturable (Km 156 microM), sensitive to temperature, and inhibited by unlabeled nicotine and various organic cations including mecamylamine and quinidine, but not by guanidine, tetraethylammonium (TEA), or neurotransmitters. Counterflux of [3H]nicotine uptake was produced by unlabeled nicotine and mecamylamine but not by cotinine or acetylcholine, consistent with a carrier-mediated transport process. The uptake could be driven by an inside-negative membrane potential or by an outwardly directed pH gradient. This is the first demonstration of a carrier-mediated transport mechanism for nicotine in a human cell line. This transport mechanism may have implications to the disposition of nicotine in the human placenta.

TI  - Rab17 localizes to recycling endosomes and regulates receptor-mediated transcytosis in epithelial cells.  
AB  - The small GTPase Rab17 is restricted to epithelial cells and its expression is induced during cell polarization. This observation has led to the suggestion that the protein may function in transcytosis, a pathway connecting the apical and basolateral endocytic systems. To analyze whether Rab17 plays a role in transcellular transport, we generated Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines stably coexpressing wild-type or mutant Rab17 and the transcytotic polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). Rab17 expressed in MDCK cells was found on small vesicles and tubules in the apical region of the cells. A significant fraction of the Rab17-positive structures was accessible to dimeric IgA internalized from the apical or basolateral cell surface via the pIgR. Furthermore, basolateral to apical transcytosis of dimeric IgA was impaired in MDCK cells overexpressing Rab17. Our data provides morphological and biochemical evidence for a role of Rab17 in the regulation of transcellular traffic through apical recycling endosomes in epithelial cells.

TI  - Radiofrequency and cryoablation of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing valvular operations [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the maze operation can restore sinus rhythm and atrial transport function in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of the application of radiofrequency and cryoablation as an alternative to the classic maze operation. METHODS: Twelve patients undergoing mitral valve procedures were included in this study. Radiofrequency and cryoablation were applied to create lesions in both atria to simulate the classic maze operation. RESULTS: There were two surgical deaths. At the mean follow-up of 10.25 months for the remaining 10 patients; 6 were in sinus rhythm, 2 in atrial rhythm, 1 in paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and 1 in atrial fibrillation. Doppler echocardiography at 6-month follow-up showed emergence of biatrial transport function in 3 patients and right atrial contractility in 8. At 12-month follow-up of 5 patients, Doppler echocardiography showed biatrial transport function in 3 and right atrial contractility in 4. CONCLUSIONS: Our modified maze procedure during valvular operation is effective for achieving an acceptable success rate to restore sinus rhythm and atrial transport function in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Placental transport of maternal immunoglobulin G in pregnancies at risk of Rh (D) hemolytic disease of the newborn.  
AB  - PROBLEM: The following questions were addressed: Is the placental transport of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG1, and IgG3 diminished in pregnancies at risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn? Is the placental transport of IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 correlated with the hemoglobin concentration in the fetus and AutoAnalyzer (AA) quantitations of maternal anti-D? METHOD OF STUDY: IgG concentrations were determined retrospectively in 41 paired fetal/maternal (f/m) samples in 31 Rh (D) alloimmunized pregnancies. IgG1 and IgG3 concentrations were determined in those 23 cases in which the results of fetal hemoglobin concentration and quantitations of maternal anti-D were available. The results were compared with values found in normal pregnancy and correlated with maternal anti-D AA quantitations and fetal hemoglobin concentrations. RESULTS: Fetal IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 concentrations, and the corresponding fetomaternal ratios in Rh (D) alloimmunized pregnancies, increased with gestational age according to the following formulas (obtained by simple regression): Fetal IgG = -8.846 + 0.491.gestational age (GA), (R2 = 0.544); fetal IgG = 10.021 + 0.46.GA (R2 = 0.463); fetal IgG3 = -0.865 + 0.039.GA, (R2 = 0.327); f/m IgG = -1.006 + 0.054.GA, (R2 = 0.557); f/m IgG1 = -1.876 + 0.085.GA, (R2 = 0.654); f/m IgG3 = -0.199 + 0.026.GA, (R2 = 0.146). CONCLUSIONS: The placental transport of IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 in women with Rh (D) immunizations is not diminished compared with normal pregnancy. However, AA quantitations of anti-D are inversely correlated with f/m IgG ratio, f/m IgG1 ratio, and fetal IgG and IgG1 concentrations (P = 0.002, P = 0.004, P = 0.02, and P = 0.02 respectively). The placental transport of IgG3 is significantly higher in pregnancies at risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn compared with IgG3 concentrations in normal pregnancy.

TI  - Effect of signal peptide changes on the extracellular processing of streptokinase from Escherichia coli: requirement for secondary structure at the cleavage junction.  
AB  - Streptokinase (SK), an extracellular protein from Streptococcus equisimilis, is secreted post-translationally by Escherichia coli using both its native and E. coli-derived transport signals. In this communication we report that cleavage specificity of signal peptidase I, and thus efficiency of secretion, varies in E. coli when SK export is directed by different transport signals. The native (+1) N-terminus of mature SK was retained when it was transported under the control of its own, PelB or LamB signal peptide. However, when translocation of SK was controlled by the OmpA or MalE signal peptide, Ala2 of mature SK was preferred as a cleavage site for the pre-SK processing. Our results indicate that compatibility of the leader peptide with the mature sequences of SK, which fulfills the requirement for a given secondary structure within the cleavage region, is essential for maintaining the correct processing of pre-SK. An OmpA-SK fusion, which results in the deletion of two N-terminal amino acid residues of mature SK, was further studied with respect to the recognition of alternative cleavage site in E. coli. The alanine at +2 in mature SK was changed to glycine or its relative position was changed to +3 by introducing a methionine residue at the +1 position. Both alterations resulted in the correct cleavage of pre-SK at the original OmpA fusion site. In contrast, introduction of an additional alanine at +4, creating three probable cleavage sites (Ala-x-Ala-x-Ala-x-Ala), resulted in the recognition of all three target sites for cleavage, with varying efficiency. The results indicate that the nature of the secondary structure generated at the cleavage junction of pre-SK, resulting from the fusion of different signal peptides, modulates the cleavage specificity of signal peptidase I during extracellular processing of SK. Based on these findings it is proposed that flexibility in the interaction of the active site of signal peptidase I with the cleavage sites of signal peptides may occur when it encounters two or more juxtaposed cleavage sites. Preference for one cleavage site over another, then, may depend on fulfillment of secondary structure requirements in the vicinity of the pre-protein cleavage junction.

TI  - Structure of the beta-galactosidase gene from Thermus sp. strain T2: expression in Escherichia coli and purification in a single step of an active fusion protein.  
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of both the bgaA gene, coding for a thermostable beta-galactosidase of Thermus sp. strain T2, and its flanking regions was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme predicts a polypeptide of 645 amino acids (Mr, 73,595). Comparative analysis of the open reading frames located in the flanking regions of the bgaA gene revealed that they might encode proteins involved in the transport and hydrolysis of sugars. The observed homology between the deduced amino acid sequences of BgaA and the beta-galactosidase of Bacillus stearothermophilus allows us to classify the new enzyme within family 42 of glycosyl hydrolases. BgaA was overexpressed in its active form in Escherichia coli, but more interestingly, an active chimeric beta-galactosidase was constructed by fusing the BgaA protein to the choline-binding domain of the major pneumococcal autolysin. This chimera illustrates a novel approach for producing an active and thermostable hybrid enzyme that can be purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, retaining the catalytic properties of the native enzyme. The chimeric enzyme showed a specific activity of 191,000 U/mg at 70 degrees C and a Km value of 1.6 mM with o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate, and it retained 50% of its initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 70 degrees C.

TI  - Developmental regulation of invariant chain proteolysis controls MHC class II trafficking in mouse dendritic cells.  
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) developmentally regulate their capacity for antigen presentation by controlling the transport and surface expression of MHC class II molecules. These events reflect a developmental regulation of invariant (Ii) chain cleavage, most likely by the cysteine protease cathepsin S. In immature DCs, inefficient Ii chain cleavage due to low cathepsin S activity leads to the transport of class II-Ii chain complexes to lysosomes, while in mature DCs, elevated cathepsin S activity results in efficient delivery of class II alphabeta dimers to the plasma membrane. Cathepsin S is not controlled transcriptionally but by a novel mechanism involving alterations in the expression and localization of an endogenous cathepsin S inhibitor cystatin C. Thus, the ratio of cystatin C to cathepsin S in developing DCs helps to determine the fate of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules.

TI  - Nuclear import and export of viruses and virus genomes.  
AB  - Many viruses replicate in the nucleus of their animal and plant host cells. Nuclear import, export, and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling play a central role in their replication cycle. Although the trafficking of individual virus proteins into and out of the nucleus has been well studied for some virus systems, the nuclear transport of larger entities such as viral genomes and capsids has only recently become a subject of molecular analysis. In this review, the general concepts emerging are discussed and a survey is provided of current information on both plant and animal viruses. Summarizing the main findings in this emerging field, it is evident that most viruses that enter or exit the nucleus take advantage of the cell's nuclear import and export machinery. With a few exceptions, viruses seem to cross the nuclear envelope through the nuclear pore complexes, making use of cellular nuclear import and export signals, receptors, and transport factors. In many cases, they capitalize on subtle control systems such as phosphorylation that regulate traffic of cellular components into and out of the nucleus. The large size of viral capsids and their composition (they contain large RNA and DNA molecules for which there are few precedents in normal nuclear transport) make the processes unique and complicated. Prior capsid disassembly (or deformation) is required before entry of viral genomes and accessory proteins can occur through nuclear pores. Capsids of different virus families display diverse uncoating programs which culminate in genome transfer through the nuclear pores.

TI  - The SNARE machinery is involved in apical plasma membrane trafficking in MDCK cells.  
AB  - We have investigated the controversial involvement of components of the SNARE (soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor [NSF] attachment protein [SNAP] receptor) machinery in membrane traffic to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial (MDCK) cells. Overexpression of syntaxin 3, but not of syntaxins 2 or 4, caused an inhibition of TGN to apical transport and apical recycling, and leads to an accumulation of small vesicles underneath the apical plasma membrane. All other tested transport steps were unaffected by syntaxin 3 overexpression. Botulinum neurotoxin E, which cleaves SNAP-23, and antibodies against alpha-SNAP inhibit both TGN to apical and basolateral transport in a reconstituted in vitro system. In contrast, we find no evidence for an involvement of N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor in TGN to apical transport, whereas basolateral transport is NSF-dependent. We conclude that syntaxin 3, SNAP-23, and alpha-SNAP are involved in apical membrane fusion. These results demonstrate that vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane does not use a mechanism that is entirely unrelated to other cellular membrane fusion events, but uses isoforms of components of the SNARE machinery, which suggests that they play a role in providing specificity to polarized membrane traffic.

TI  - Doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-glutathione conjugates, but not unconjugated drugs, competitively inhibit leukotriene C4 transport mediated by MRP/GS-X pump.  
AB  - Overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) gene encoding a human GS-X pump in cultured cells resulted in increased cellular resistance to antitumor agents, including doxorubicin (Dox) and daunomycin (Dau), as well as certain heavy metals. However, studies with membrane vesicles prepared from the resistant cells revealed that Dox and Dau are poor substrates for the transport mediated by MRP/GS-X pump, suggesting that metabolic modifications of these drugs might be required for the transport. To test this hypothesis, we prepared four glutathione conjugates by linking the cysteine residue of GSH to Dox and Dau at eitehr the C-7 or C-14 position. The affinity of the synthesized conjugates toward MRP/GS-X pump was examined in the LTC4 transport assay using membrane vesicles prepared from an MRP1 gene-overexpressing cell line, SR3A. Unconjugated Dox and Dau failed to inhibit the transport of LTC4, whereas 30 microM GS-Dox or GS-Dau conjugates completely inhibited the transport. Kinetic analyses revealed that the inhibition by these GS-conjugates is competitive with Ki values ranging from 60 to 200 nM, suggesting that these compounds have high affinities toward MRP/GS-X pump and share the common binding site(s) with LTC4. Our present results support the hypothesis that glutathionation can facilitate the transport of anthracyclines by the MRP/GS-X pump.

TI  - Trafficking of molecules and metabolic signals in the retina.  
AB  - Photoreceptors need the support of pigment epithelial (PE) and Muller glial cells in order to maintain visual sensitivity and neurotransmitter resynthesis. In rod outer segments (ROS), all-trans-retinal is transformed to all-trans-retinol by retinol dehydrogenase using NADPH. NADPH is restored in ROS by the pentose phosphate pathway utilizing high amounts of glucose supplied by choriocapillaries. The retinal formed is transported to PE cells where regeneration of 11-cis-retinal occurs. Muller cells take up and metabolize glucose predominantly to lactate which is massively released into the extracellular space (ES). Lactate is taken up by photoreceptors, where it is transformed to pyruvate which, in turn, enters the Krebs cycle in mitochondria of the inner segment. Stimulation of neurotransmitter release by darkness induces 130% rise in the amount of glutamate released into ES. Glutamate is transported into Muller cells where it is predominantly transformed to glutamine. Stimulation of photoreceptors induces an eightfold increase in glutamine formation. It appears, therefore, that there is a signaling function in the transfer of amino acids from Muller cells to photoreceptors. Work on the model-system of the honeybee retina demonstrated that photoreceptors release NH4+ and glutamate in a stimulus-dependent manner which, in turn, contribute to the biosynthesis of alanine in glia. Alanine released into the extracellular space is taken up and used by photoreceptors. Glial cells take glutamate by high-affinity transporters. This uptake induces a transient change in glial cell metabolism. The transformation of glutamate to glutamine is possibly also controlled by the uptake of NH4+ which directly affects cellular metabolism.

TI  - Iontophoresis of monomeric insulin analogues in vitro: effects of insulin charge and skin pretreatment.  
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of association state and net charge of human insulin analogues on the rate of iontophoretic transport across hairless mouse skin, and the effect of different skin pretreatments on said transport. No insulin flux was observed with anodal delivery probably because of degradation at the Ag/AgCl anode. The flux during cathodal iontophoresis through intact skin was insignificant for human hexameric insulin, and only low and variable fluxes were observed for monomeric insulins. Using stripped skin on the other hand, the fluxes of monomeric insulins with two extra negative charges were 50-100 times higher than that of hexameric human insulin. Introducing three additional charges led to a further 2-3-fold increase in flux. Wiping the skin gently with absolute alcohol prior to iontophoresis resulted in a 1000-fold increase in transdermal transport of insulin relative to that across untreated skin, i.e. to almost the same level as stripping the skin. The alcohol pretreatment reduced the electrical resistance of the skin, presumably by lipid extraction. In conclusion, monomeric insulin analogues with at least two extra negative charges can be iontophoretically delivered across hairless mouse skin, whereas insignificant flux is observed with human, hexameric insulin. Wiping the skin with absolute alcohol prior to iontophoresis gave substantially improved transdermal transport of monomeric insulins resulting in clinically relevant delivery rates for basal treatment.

TI  - Bovine herpesvirus-1 infection affects the peptide transport activity in bovine cells.  
AB  - Infection of cattle with bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) impairs the cell-mediated immune response (CMI) of the affected host. We investigated the location of interference of BHV-1 with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway by employing an assay that allows assessment of the peptide transport activity of the Transporter associated with Antigen Presentation (TAP) from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found a considerable down-regulation of the peptide transport activity in bovine epithelial cells, taking place as early as 2 h after virus infection. This down-regulation was also dose-dependent, and, at high multiplicities of infection (moi), led to an almost complete shutdown of TAP. By inhibiting peptide transport into the ER, the virus impairs loading of MHC class I molecules and their subsequent egress from the ER to the cell surface. This may lead to defective priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, BHV-1 is yet another member of its family Herpesviridae that selectively interferes with the host's antigen presentation machinery to evade the host's immune response in vivo.

TI  - Phylogenetic approaches to the identification and characterization of protein families and superfamilies.  
AB  - With the advent of megabase genome sequencing, the need for computational analyses increases exponentially. Sequencing errors must be corrected, encoded proteins must be identified, functions must be assigned to these proteins, and distant phylogenetic relationships must be recognized in order to maximize the yield of information obtainable from genome sequencing projects. Both the computer and the human brain have their limitations, but using them in combination, the biologist can vastly extend his or her analytic capabilities. Computer techniques can be used to estimate protein structure, function, biogenesis, and evolution. In this review, the application of available computer programs to several protein families, particularly transport, receptor, and transcriptional regulatory protein families, illustrate our current capabilities and limitations. Although some multidomain protein families are evolutionarily homogeneous, others have mosaic origins. Evidence concerning the nature and frequency of occurrence of domain shuffling, splicing, fusion, deletion, and duplication during evolution of specific protein families is evaluated. It is shown that specific families of enzymes, receptors, transport proteins, and transcriptional regulatory proteins share a common evolutionary origin, frequently diverging in function because of domain splicing and ligation. Some large families arose gradually over evolutionary time, whereas others developed suddenly, due to bursts of intragenic or intergenic (or both) duplication events occurring over relatively short periods of time. It is argued that energy coupling to transport was a late occurrence, superimposed on preexisting mechanisms of solute facilitation. It is also shown that several transport protein families have evolved independently of each other, employing different routes, at different times in evolutionary history, to give topologically similar transmembrane protein complexes.

TI  - Neuropeptide Y: some viewpoints on a multifaceted peptide in the normal and diseased nervous system.  
AB  - Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methodologies the localization of neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and two of its receptors, the Y1- and the Y2-receptor (R), has been analysed in various tissues in normal animals and animals subjected to different experimental procedures as well as animals with a genetic and an acquired disease. (1) Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are discussed with special focus on the effect of peripheral nerve injury. In normal DRG neurons NPY cannot be detected, whereas Y1-R mRNA and Y1-R-like immunoreactivity (LI) are strongly expressed. The Y1-Rs decorate the membrane of the cell soma and are not transported peripherally into the axonal branches. Y2-R mRNA levels are low. After axotomy there is a marked increase in NPY, a decrease in Y1-Rs and an increase in Y2-Rs. The Y2-R is transported centrifugally. These findings suggest that NPY-ergic mechanisms participate in the adaptive changes of sensory neurons in response to injury. (2) Using specific antibodies the cellular and subcellular localization of the Y1-R protein have been analysed in cerebral blood vessels. The results demonstrate high concentrations of receptors in smooth muscle cells around pial arterioles with lower numbers in large vessels on the basal surface of the brain. In many regions the receptors 'disappear' after the arterioles have entered the brain tissue. At the ultrastructural level the receptors are found both on the endothelial and peripheral side of the muscle cells as well as laterally, where muscle cells oppose each other. The receptor protein is often associated with small vesicles. No NPY-positive nerve fibers were found around the Y1-R-rich arterioles, but they were only seen around the arteries with low Y1-R levels. The Y1-R-rich arterioles were, however, seen close to numerous NPY-positive fibers originating from central interneurons. These findings raise the possibility that centrally originating NPY can influence cerebral blood flow, possibly by stimulating NPY-Rs on the peripheral side of the muscle cells. However, also blood borne NPY, released under special conditions, such as stress from sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla and transported with blood, may stimulate receptors on the endothelial side of the smooth muscle cells. (3) In the arcuate nucleus Y1- and Y2-Rs are found, whereby the Y1-Rs are located in its ventro-medial portion and co-localized with POMC peptides, and the Y2-R in its ventromedial part, partly co-localized with NPY. NPY nerve endings makes synaptic contact with the POMC/Y1-R-positive neurons. In a mouse model for genetic anorexia very high levels of NPY were observed in arcuate neurons as compared to control mice. However, NPY mRNA levels were not different between the two groups. Taken together these findings are in good agreement with the view that NPY in the arcuate nucleus plays an important role in regulating feeding behaviour. (4) After intracerebral prion inoculation in mice an upregulation of NPY mRNA levels was observed in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this effect was seen at a time point just before the first behavioural symptoms were manifested. At approximately the same time there was a dramatic decrease in Y2-R binding in strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, whereas in other regions no changes or much smaller changes were observed. Also, there was only a very slight decrease in Y2-R mRNA levels in CA3 neurons. It thus appears as if the prion disease prevents ligand binding to the Y2-R, perhaps by influencing traffic of receptor proteins, possibly at the level of cell membrane-associated caveolae, which have been implicated in the conversion of normal protein to scrapie protein. It is possible that these changes in NPY-ergic mechanisms may underlie some of th

TI  - Interference of L-arginine analogues with L-arginine transport mediated by the y+ carrier hCAT-2B.  
AB  - The inducible human cationic amino acid transporter hCAT-2B was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and this system was used to test the effect of several NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and/or L-arginine analogues on L-arginine transport by this y+ carrier. L-NG-Methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA), asymmetrical L-NG, NG-dimethyl-L-arginine (L-ADMA), L-N5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO), L-NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), and L-NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) all inhibited the inducible NOS II extracted from RAW 264.7 macrophages induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. L-NMA, L-ADMA, and L-NIO also competed with L-arginine for transport by hCAT-2B, whereas L-NNA and L-NAME did not. The two L-arginine analogues, symmetrical NG, NG-dimethyl-L-arginine (L-SDMA) and alpha-amino-delta-isothioureidovaleric acid (AITV), as well as L-lysine, did not block enzymatic activity of NOS II, but did compete for L-arginine transport mediated by hCAT-2B. L-Lysine and L-SDMA were transported efficiently by hCAT-2B and exchanged against intracellular L-arginine, resulting in an L-arginine depletion of the cells. AITV was a much poorer substrate of hCAT-2B and had only little effect on intracellular L-arginine concentrations. These data indicate that substrate recognition differs markedly between the inducible L-arginine transporter hCAT-2B and the inducible NOS II, with different L-arginine analogues having affinity to only one or both of these proteins.

TI  - Implantable micropump system for augmented liver perfusion.  
AB  - Liver cirrhosis, a worldwide health problem, decreases the blood flow through the liver. This in turn leads to dangerous portal hypertension and decreased metabolic function within the liver. To improve this situation, a new concept is proposed which involves introducing a microaxial blood pump into the portal vein. This device is intended to increase blood flow through the liver and to enhance hepatic function. Furthermore, high pressures will be reduced to physiological levels. The microaxial pump with its single stage impeller is powered by a proximally integrated microelectric motor. The pump unit is completely immersed within the blood vessel. Heat caused by electrical and mechanical losses will be transported into the blood. In vitro optimization of the pump design was accomplished using both hydraulic and hemolysis tests.

TI  - Lactate production and clearance in exercise. Effects of training. A mini-review.  
AB  - Lactate accumulates if pyruvate formation exceeds pyruvate oxidation. Accelerated glycogenolysis is essential for lactate production. Glycogen and epinephrine enhance glycogen phosphorylase activity and this is higher in type II b than in type I fibers. Pyruvate oxidation is enhanced by exercise-induced increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and is relatively impaired by low oxygen availability and low mitochondrial oxidative capacity. During exercise lactate is eliminated in liver, heart, and resting and working muscle. In muscle, elimination depends on plasma concentration, fiber type, and fiber conditions. Due to influence on hormonal response, mitochondrial oxidative capacity and fiber recruitment, training diminishes glycogenolysis and lactate production. Training also increases lactate clearance. This reflects increased hepatic capacity for gluconeogenesis as well as increased lactate transport capacity and oxidative capacity and reduced glycogenolysis in muscle. The fact that endurance performance can be predicted from the plasma lactate versus exercise intensity relationship illustrates that the plasma lactate level is a finely balanced result of the interplay between many factors of importance for endurance exercise.

TI  - Acute and chronic regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase transport activity in the RN22 Schwann cell line in response to stimulation of cyclic AMP production.  
AB  - Na+/K+-ATPase-dependent Rb+ uptake of RN22 Schwann cells was stimulated by cholera toxin (0.25 microg/ml), forskolin (2 mM), or 8-bromo cAMP (1 mM). At 2 h Rb+ uptake was increased by 162+/-6% (cholera toxin), 151+/-14% (forskolin), and 207+/-15% (8-bromo cAMP). Cholera toxin or 8-bromo cAMP treatment for 12-24 h resulted in a second peak of Na+/K+-ATPase-dependent Rb+ transport activity of 186+/-12 and 265+/-9% of control, respectively. Cholera toxin also transiently stimulated the activity of the Na+, K+, 2Cl- -cotransporter with a peak at 2 h (179+/-9%), returning to basal levels by 24 h. Inhibition of the Na+,K+,2Cl- -cotransporter by bumetanide (0.1 mM) or by reduction of the Na+ gradient (10 mM veratridine treatment) prevented the early peak in ATPase activity but not the second peak. These results indicated that the early transient stimulation of Na+/K+ ATPase activity by cholera toxin was due to an increase in cellular Na+, secondary to stimulation of Na+,K+,2Cl -cotransport activity. Western blot analysis of cellular homogenates and purified membrane fractions showed that the second peak of Rb+ uptake activity was a result of translocation of transport protein from an intracellular microsomal pool to the plasma membrane. Rb+ uptake by dominant negative protein kinase A mutants of the RN22 cell was not stimulated by cholera toxin treatment (acute or chronic) confirming the cAMP/protein kinase A dependency of both acute and long-term regulation of transport activity. In the absence of a change in Michaelis constants or of an increase in total transport protein of cellular homogenates, neither a change in enzyme kinetics nor an increase in de novo synthesis of transport protein could account for the increase in transport activity.

TI  - The molecular characterization of transport vesicles.  
AB  - Secretion, endocytosis and transport to the lytic compartment are fundamental, highly coordinated features of the eukaryotic cell. These intracellular transport processes are facilitated by vesicles, many of which are small (100 nm or less in diameter) and 'coated' on their cytoplasmic surface. Research into the structure of the coat proteins and how they interact with the components of the vesicle membrane to ensure the selective packaging of the cargo molecules and their correct targeting, has been quite extensive in mammalian and yeast cell biology. By contrast, our knowledge of the corresponding types of transport vesicles in plant cells is limited. Nevertheless, the available data indicate that a considerable homology between plant and non-plant coat polypeptides exists, and it is also suggestive of a certain similarity in the mechanisms underlying targeting in all eukaryotes. In this article we shall concentrate on three major types of transport vesicles: clathrin-coated vesicles, COP-coated vesicles, and 'dense' vesicles, the latter of which are responsible for the transport of vacuolar storage proteins in maturing legume cotyledons. For each we will summarize the current literature on animal and yeast cells, and then present the relevant data derived from work on plant cells. In addition, we briefly review the evidence in support of the 'SNARE' hypothesis, which explains how vesicles find and fuse with their target membrane.

TI  - Multiplicity of biliary excretion mechanisms for the camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11), its metabolite SN-38, and its glucuronide: role of canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter and P-glycoprotein.  
AB  - A frequent dose-limiting effect of irinotecan (CPT-11) is its gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea), which is thought to be related to biliary excretion of CPT-11 and its metabolites. Accordingly, we have investigated the mechanism of biliary excretion of these compounds. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the biliary excretion of the four anionic forms of CPT-11 and its metabolites was reduced in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats, which carry a mutation of the hepatic canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT) gene. The protein encoded by this gene is expressed on the bile canalicular membrane and is responsible for the transport of organic anions into bile. Detailed analysis using isolated liver bile canalicular membrane vesicles to identify transport systems showed that cMOAT is responsible for biliary excretion of the low-affinity component of the carboxylate form of CPT-11 and the high-affinity component of both the lactone and carboxylate forms of SN-38 glucuronide. The carboxylate form of SN-38 is transported by cMOAT alone.  Transport of the high-affinity component of CPT-11 was inhibited by verapamil and PSC-833, but their effect on the transport of its low-affinity component was minimal. In addition, ATP dependence in the uptake of CPT-11 by membrane vesicles obtained from a P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing cell line was observed. Thus P-gp may be responsible for transport of the high-affinity component of the carboxylate form of CPT-11.

TI  - Effect of diuretics on sodium and chloride permeability in the rat papillary collecting duct.  
AB  - While in vivo data suggests that diuretics such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide alter inner medulla collecting duct (IMCD) cell electrolyte transport, this has not been confirmed by in vivo studies nor have the mechanisms been evaluated. This study evaluated the direct effect of these diuretics as well as amiloride on sodium and chloride unidirectional permeability in the isolated perfused rat IMCD. In the absence of diuretics, the permeability of sodium was lower than that of chloride (0.63 +/- 0.05 compared with 0.83 +/- 0.08 micrometer/s), although both were relatively impermeable when compared to water. Furosemide (10(-4)) and hydrochlorothiazide (10(-3)) both increased the diffusional permeability of chloride by approximately 30% (0.80 +/- 0.06 to 1.04 +/- 0.09 micrometer/s, p < 0.01, and 0.74 +/- 0.09 to 0.98 +/- 0.10 micrometer/s, p < 0.02, respectively). However, sodium permeability was unaltered. Inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase by ouabain or cooling (4 degrees C) inhibited basal sodium but not chloride permeability while a maximal antidiuretic AVP concentration did not alter sodium or chloride permeability. However, increasing the lumen and bath sodium chloride concentration from 150 to 300 and 600 mM significantly increased both sodium and particularly chloride conductance. In contrast, amiloride (10(-4)) significantly reduced both sodium and chloride permeability. These studies support a direct effect of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide on the IMCD and suggest that their in vivo effect is primarily mediated by facilitating the passive movement of chloride into the lumen via a favourable electrochemical gradient. These results also demonstrate that amiloride inhibits both sodium and chloride unidirectional permeability by mechanisms separate to that of the sulphonamide-related diuretics.

TI  - Experimental elucidation of mechanical load-induced fluid flow and its potential role in bone metabolism and functional adaptation.  
AB  - Several researchers have developed theories implicating some manifestation of mechanical forces such as stress, strain, and strain energy density for the initiation of cellular processes associated with functional adaptation. The mechanisms underlying dynamic bone growth and repair in response to mechanical stimuli, however, are not fully understood. Load-induced fluid flow has been postulated to provide a mechanism for the transmission of mechanical signals (eg, via shear stresses, enhancement of molecular transport, or electrical effects) and the subsequent elicitation of a functional adaptation response in bone. Although indirect evidence for such fluid flow phenomena can be found in the literature pertaining to strain-generated potentials, experimental studies are inherently difficult. This motivated the authors to develop theoretical as well as ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo experimental methods for the study of transport processes and fluid flow within bone under well-controlled mechanical loading conditions. By introducing tracer substances such as disulphine blue, procion red, and microperoxidase into the experimental system, transport and fluid flow could be visualized at tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels, respectively. Based on these studies, it could be shown that load-induced fluid flow represents a powerful mechanism to enhance molecular transport within compact bone tissue. Furthermore, the distribution of transport-elucidating tracers is a function of mechanical loading parameters as well as the location within the cross-section of the bone cortex.

TI  - Passive and active protection against disorders of the gut.  
AB  - The large surface area of mucosal surfaces, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract, is protected against microorganisms and environmental antigens by various innate factors (e.g., mucins, lactoferrin, and others) and specific antibodies which are of IgA, or in some species, IgG Isotypes. Passive protection provided by effective prenatal transplacental transport of maternal antibodies and/or post-natal consumption of milk antibodies in breastfed newborns, is essential for the survival of neonates. Passive protection of mucosal surfaces by pre-formed antibodies in non-breast juveniles or adults is currently used only on an experimental basis: IgA-enriched preparations of gamma-globulin have been successfully given to children, and antibodies specific for several gastrointestinal pathogens have been isolated from immunized cows' milk, hens' eggs, or transgenic plants. Systemic administration of pre-formed antibodies is effective for protection against intestinal pathogens in species (e.g., mice, rats) endowed with efficient hepatobiliary transport of IgA into the gut lumen. However, this route of antibody administration is of limited efficiency in other species, including humans, in which almost all intestinal antibodies are produced locally by plasma cells in the gut mucosa and are not derived to a significant degree from the circulation. Active immunization is preferable for long-lasting protection. The site of immunization and presence of lymphoid tissues with inductive potential play an essential role in generating humoral immune responses in mucosal secretions. The relative efficiency of immunization routes (e.g., oral, nasal, rectal or genital) in the induction of preferential antibody responses in the intestinal secretion has not been studied extensively. Furthermore, suitable antigen delivery systems for achieving this goal must also be considered.

In this paper we provide the first biochemical evidence that the MNK protein functions as a copper-translocating P-type ATPase in mammalian cells. The enzyme activity in membrane vesicles prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing MNK was ATP-dependent, correlated with the amount of MNK and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to copper. The copper transport was observed only under reducing conditions suggesting MNK transports Cu(I).

TI  - Induction of sodium-dependent bile acid transporter messenger RNA, protein, and activity in rat ileum by cholic acid.  
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter reclaims bile acids from the intestinal lumen to preserve their enterohepatic recirculation. The present studies sought to determine the possible role of enteric bile acids in the molecular regulation of the apical bile acid transporter in rat ileal mucosa. METHODS: Paired rats were fed a control diet or control diet plus cholic acid (1%) or ursodeoxycholic acid (1%) for 10 days. Other paired rats underwent biliary diversion for 72 hours, followed by intraduodenal infusion of taurocholate or fluid/electrolytes. Transporter protein, messenger RNA (mRNA), and activity were determined in the distal 15 cm of ileal mucosa. RESULTS: Transporter protein and mRNA levels in cholic acid-fed rats increased approximately threefold above levels in paired rats fed the control diet (P < 0.02). Similarly, sodium-dependent [3H]taurocholate uptake into membrane vesicles from cholic acid-fed rats increased twofold above uptake into vesicles from control-fed rats because of a twofold increase in maximal transport velocity. In biliary-diverted rats (72-96 hours), transporter protein decreased to 57% +/- 5% of paired controls with intact enterohepatic circulation (P < 0.0001). The intraduodenal infusion of taurocholate (24 hours) in biliary-diverted rats resulted in a time-dependent reinduction of transporter protein expression (3.5-fold). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of the ileal apical bile acid transporter is induced at a pretranslational level by free or taurine-conjugated cholic acid within the small intestine.

AB  - The coupled processes of the chloroplast trans-envelope transport of malate and oxaloacetate and their interconversion as catalyzed by the stromal NADP-linked malate dehydrogenase are quantitatively analyzed by means of a steady-state model. The equation for the NADP-malate dehydrogenase reaction is developed. The empirical dependence of enzyme activity on NADPH and NADP+ is used to determine its actual activity. The trans-envelope counter exchange of malate and oxaloacetate is described by a kinetic model of the translocator. Kinetic parameters are derived from known data, except for the Km value and the maximum rate for oxaloacetate transport, which are estimated from oxaloacetate-dependent malate formation in isolated intact chloroplasts. Using the kinetic properties of the system and the known metabolite concentrations, the model demonstrates that photosynthetically generated NADPH can be exported efficiently from the chloroplasts to the cytosol by the malate-valve system. The transfer capacity of the malate valve is estimated not to exceed 20 mumol (mg Chl)-1 h-1 (or 5% of the electron transport) under normal physiological conditions. The possible role of the malate valve in leaf cells under normal conditions and during stress is discussed.

TI  - Application of fractal kinetics for carrier-mediated transport of drugs across intestinal epithelial membrane.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Fractal kinetics was used for the analysis of the carrier-mediated transport for drugs across the intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS: The transport was examined under various agitation rates using a monolayer of Caco-2 cells and rabbit ileum sheets. RESULTS: The passive transport of antipyrine across Caco-2 cells was increased with the increasing rate of agitation and was supposed to be caused by a change in the thickness of the unstirred water layer. On the contrary, in the case of L-lactic acid transport, which follows a carrier-mediated transport mechanism, the more the agitation rate controlling the fractal dimension was increased, the more the permeability rate across the Caco-2 cells was decreased. Fractal kinetic analysis of L-lactic acid transport indicated that the permeability was caused by a single saturable process. Similar agitation effects with L-lactic acid transport were observed in the transport of phenylalanine and cephradine in Caco-2 cells. However, the permeability rates of benzoic acid and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose across Caco-2 cells and L-lactic acid transport across the rabbit ileum tissue indicated the maximum levels at a designated agitation rate. This phenomenon was likely to be caused by the agitation effects controlling not only the fractal environment but also the unstirred water layer. CONCLUSIONS: Carrier-mediated transports are well defined by fractal kinetics rather than classical kinetic analysis. Fractal kinetics are one of the important areas for understanding and confirming the properties of a carrier-mediated transport process.

After incubation of sirolimus with human and pig small intestinal microsomes, five metabolites were detected using high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray-mass spectrometry: hydroxy, dihydroxy, trihydroxy, desmethyl and didesmethyl sirolimus. The same metabolites were generated by human liver microsomes and pig small intestinal mucosa in the Ussing chamber. Anti-CYP3A antibodies, as well as the specific CYP3A inhibitors troleandomycin and erythromycin, inhibited small intestinal metabolism of sirolimus, confirming that, as in the liver, CYP3A enzymes are responsible for sirolimus metabolism in the small intestine. Of 32 drugs tested, only known CYP3A substrates inhibited sirolimus intestinal metabolism with inhibitor constants (Ki) equal to those in human liver microsomes. The formation of hydroxy sirolimus by small intestinal microsomes isolated from 14 different patients ranged from 28 to 220 pmol.min-1.mg-1 microsomal protein. In the Ussing chamber, >99% of the sirolimus metabolites reentered the mucosa chamber against a sirolimus gradient, indicating active countertransport. Intestinal drug metabolism and countertransport into the gut lumen, drug interactions with CYP3A substrates and inhibitors in the small intestine and an 8-fold interindividual variability of the intestinal metabolite formation rate significantly contribute to the low and highly variable bioavailability of sirolimus.

Fick's first law was used to derive a transport model for hydrophilic drugs, assuming that the oil/water (o/w) partitioning process was fast compared with membrane transport and therefore drug transport was limited by the membrane.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of drug transport in emulsion systems.  
AB  - Two mathematical models for the prediction of drug transport in triphasic (oil, water and micellar) emulsion systems as a function of micellar concentration have been developed and these models were evaluated by comparing experimental and simulated data. Fick's first law was used to derive a transport model for hydrophilic drugs, assuming that the oil/water (o/w) partitioning process was fast compared with membrane transport and therefore drug transport was limited by the membrane. Consecutive rate equations were used to model transport of hydrophobic drugs in emulsion systems assuming that the o/w interface acts as a barrier to drug transport. Benzoic acid and phenol were selected as hydrophilic model drugs. Phenylazoaniline and benzocaine were selected as hydrophobic model drugs. Transport studies at pH 3.0 and 7.0 were conducted using side-by-side diffusion cells. According to the hydrophilic model, an increase in micellar concentration is expected to decrease drug transport rates. The effective permeability coefficients (Peff) of drugs were calculated using an equation relating Peff and the total apparent volume of drug distribution (determined experimentally using drug/membrane permeability and partition coefficient values). The hydrophobic model was fitted to the experimental data for the cumulative amount of model drug in the receiver cells using a weighted least-squares estimation program (PCNONLIN). The oil/continuous phase partitioning rates (k1) and the membrane transport rates (k2) were estimated. The goodness of fit was assessed from the correlation coefficients of plots of predicted versus experimental data. The predicted data were consistent with the experimental data for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic models.
