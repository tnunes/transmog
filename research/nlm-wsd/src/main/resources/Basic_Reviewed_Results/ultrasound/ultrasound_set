TI  - Single photon emission and cerebral computerised tomographic scan and transcranial Doppler sonographic findings in eclampsia.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define more clearly the neuropathophysiology of eclampsia utilising single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral computerised tomography (CT) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. DESIGN: A prospective study SETTING: The obstetric unit in King Edward VIII Hospital, a large tertiary referral centre in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five women with eclampsia. INTERVENTIONS: Imaging and ultrasonographic investigations were performed within 48 hours postpartum. Unenhanced cerebral CT scans were performed in all the women and SPECT scans were performed on 63 women using Technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) as a tracer of regional cerebral blood flow. Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity waveforms were measured using 2 MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound via the transtemporal approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abnormalities in SPECT scan, CT scan and TCD ultrasound findings. RESULTS: SPECT scanning revealed perfusion deficits in the watershed areas in all women, 75% of whom had concomitant deficits in the parieto-occipital areas of the brain. Hypodensities (cerebral oedema) were reported in 38 CT scans (58.5%), with parieto-occipital involvement in 97.4% of cases. Increased flow velocity measurements in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries were recorded in 36 (85.7%) women in whom TCD ultrasound was performed. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiological mechanism of eclamptic seizures is primary cerebral vasospasm with resultant ischaemia and cerebral oedema involving mainly the watershed areas and parieto-occipital lobes of the brain. SPECT scanning has been shown to be superior to CT scanning and TCD ultrasonography in detecting neuropathophysiologic alterations in eclampsia. However, each of the three investigative tools provide its own unique information and all three are necessary research techniques to improve our understanding of the neuropathophysiological mechanism of eclamptic seizures.

TI  - Monitoring the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip with the Pavlik harness. The role of ultrasound.  
AB  - We report the six-year results of a prospective, controlled demographic trial of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) treated in the Pavlik harness using ultrasound supervision. Our aim was to assess the value of ultrasound and its role in monitoring reduction in the harness, in terms of progression or failure of reduction at an early state. From 1988 to 1994, a total of 221 patients with 370 ultrasonographically abnormal hips was treated in the Pavlik harness. This represents a treatment rate for the Southampton district of 5.1 per 1000 live births. Sixteen hips in 12 patients were not reduced in the harness and required surgical treatment; 95.7% were successfully reduced. One case of mild avascular necrosis (0.3%) was identified in those treated by harness alone. Of the 221 patients 87.8% remain under radiological review, with 3.2% of affected hips showing continued, mild acetabular dysplasia. We conclude that ultrasound monitoring has led to an acceptably low level of intervention, a high reduction rate and minimal iatrogenic complications. The trial is continuing.

TI  -  Preoperative ultrasound mapping of the saphenous vein: prognostic value on early post operative results, a prospective study.  
AB  - A prospective series of 92 patients had their greater saphenous vein assessed with duplex ultrasound scanning prior to planned infrainguinal bypass procedures. Sixteen (17%) bypass procedures thrombosed within the first week postoperatively. A naturally occurring optimal vein diameter was discovered: 3.5-4.2 mm at mid-thigh level and 0-1.5 mm less at mid-calf level. It was significantly correlated with higher one week patency: thrombosis occurred in 11% in veins with this optimal diameter combination and in 19% in all other combination (P < 0.05). These results confirm and expand a retrospective study.

TI  -  [Ultrasound of segment distraction and callus formation in reconstruction of the mandible. Value of surgical ultrasound of callus distraction of vascularized ilial crest transplants and mandibular segments in a previously irradiated area]  
AB  - PURPOSE: B-scan ultrasonography (US) was applied in patients subjected to callus distraction for bone formation at the interface of mandibular segments and vascularised bone grafts. METHODS: This study consisted of 7 patients requiring further surgical augmentation to allow for prosthetic treatment. All patients had been preoperatively irradiated percutaneously in the region of the primary oral squamous cell carcinoma up to an isodose of 60-75.5 Gy. Ablative surgery was then performed, including discontinuity resection of the mandible. Vascularised iliac crest grafts had been chosen due to poor healing conditions in the irradiated recipient site. For callus distraction, a distraction device was inserted in both the mandibular segment and the bone graft. Subsequently, osteotomy was performed, and distracting forces were applied to the segments. For US, a small-part applicator was used (7.5 MHz). RESULTS: US gives a true estimation of the distraction length, actually achieved at the time of investigation. The applicator can be easily adjusted to the area of interest. Application is safe and easy, the results are reliable, and the procedure can be carried out without affecting the hygiene of the wound after surgical intervention. In addition, US enables the supervising surgeon to detect zones of calcification in the area of callus distraction at an earlier point than can be detected by standard x-ray documentation, thus facilitating control of the therapy. CONCLUSION: US is highly recommended for routine application in callus distraction of the mandible. X-ray documentation is a "must".

TI  - Influence of ablated tissue on the formation of high-intensity focused ultrasound lesions.  
AB  - In order to ablate tumours using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) it is necessary to irradiate the tumour with a confluent array of single ultrasound exposures. We have identified a phenomenon that we term lesion-to-lesion interaction, which occurs when the spatial separation of individual exposures is such that an existing lesions appears to affect the formation of a subsequent lesion. This article investigates the implications of this phenomenon for strategies to ablate large tissue volumes in the treatment of hepatic metastases. Experiments on pig and rat livers have been carried out using a focused ultrasound system with a frequency of 1.7 MHz, an in situ spatially averaged focal intensity (ISAL) of 133-658 W cm-2 (ISP of 239-1185 W cm-2) and an exposure duration of 5-15 s. The results show that there is interaction between lesions that spatial exposure separations that depend on the intensities and exposure durations used. As a result, either subsequent lesions form closer to the ultrasound source (if the focal peak of the ultrasound beam is placed deep inside the liver tissue) or their length is reduced (if the focal peak is near the liver surface). An explanation is suggested for this effect and a strategy for its avoidance during in vivo HIFU treatment is discussed.

TI  - Effectiveness of SWL for lower-pole caliceal nephrolithiasis: evaluation of 452 cases.  
AB  - The authors report on the treatment of lower-pole caliceal nephrolithiasis with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) using the Czech-made Medilit M-5 lithotripter. In 310 patients, they have performed 452 treatments and evaluated the results 3 months after the last session using plain radiographs and ultrasound examination. The effectiveness of treatment and the success rate of SWL decreased with increasing size of stones: with stones >20 mm, it declined to 30%. This poor success rate was attributable not only to the size of the concrement, but also to its location in a lower calix, which is unfavorable for the passage of fragments. For big lower-pole caliceal stones (>20 mm in the longest diameter), the authors recommend percutaneous nephrolithotomy as the primary management method, the effectiveness of which does not depend on the size of the stone. The success rate achieved in treating the lower-pole caliceal lithiasis using the Medilit M-5 machine was 61.3%, similar to that achieved with other lithotripters.

TI  - Betamethasone treatment and fetal lung perfusion evaluated with color Doppler energy imaging.  
AB  - The aim of this study was semiquantitative evaluation of tissue blood flow in the fetal lung before and after administration of betamethasone. This was carried out by means of computer analysis of ultrasound Doppler signals obtained by the color Doppler energy (CDE) technique. CDE signals were recorded in 20 singleton pregnancies with appropriate growth and imminent preterm delivery between 26 and 33 weeks of gestation. The CDE signal recordings were made before and after intramuscular administration of betamethasone 8 mg/day for 3 days. Fixed preset CDE system control settings for the fetal right lung were used during the examinations. Images from CDE scans were recorded on S-VHS videotape and transmitted for computer analysis of 8-bit images at 256 gray-scale levels. The mean flow signal intensity was recorded for the fetal lung before and after betamethasone administration. Additionally, blood velocity waveforms were measured in the intrapulmonary arteries and veins in the peripheral part of the lung. CDE signals from the fetal lung indicated increased energy values after corticosteroid treatment in 16 cases. In three cases there was no change in CDE signal values, and in one case a fall of the signal value was noted. Blood velocity waveforms from the intrapulmonary arteries showed decreased resistance to flow in 15 cases, increased resistance to flow in four cases and no change in one case. No significant differences in venous blood flow velocities were found. In conclusion, the results suggest that there is an increase in fetal lung blood perfusion after maternal corticosteroid administration.

TI  - Endometrial volume change during spontaneous menstrual cycles: volumetry by transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: At present, only limited data are available on endometrial volume during the menstrual cycle. Most of these studies deal with animal models and use magnetic resonance imaging for volume measuring. The application of three-dimensional ultrasound in endometrial volume estimation is the subject of this study. SETTING: Patients visiting the outpatient unit of the division of endocrinology and reproductive medicine of a university hospital. PATIENT(S): Twenty patients with a history of a normal menstrual cycle were selected. INTERVENTION(S): Ultrasound examinations were performed during a single menstrual cycle in addition to routine laboratory tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Uterus-endometrial volume ratio. RESULT(S): Data from 18 patients could be evaluated. In 81 examinations the endometrium volume could be determined. Mean endometrial volume measured by three-dimensional ultrasound was 1.23 cm3. Mean uterus volume was 48.93 cm3. The change of the uterus-endometrial volume ratio showed a good correlation with the day of menstrual cycle. Quadratic regression analysis of volume and cycle length was R2 = 0.432. CONCLUSION(S): Three-dimensional ultrasound allows assessment of volume data of the female internal genitalia. In this study changes of the endometrial volume in menstrual cycles were measured. Additional studies are required to give information on the clinical impact of this new technique of endometrial volume estimation.

TI  - Assessment of embryonic anatomy at 6-8 weeks of gestation by intrauterine and transvaginal sonography.  
AB  - Our purpose was to compare the ultrasound visualization of the early first-trimester embryo using transvaginal and intrauterine sonography. In all, 32 women about to undergo therapeutic abortion at 6-8.9 weeks gestation were studied using a specially developed catheter-based, high-resolution, real-time miniature (2.4 mm outer diameter) ultrasonography transducer (20 MHz). Before the intrauterine sonographic procedure was performed, transvaginal sonographic assessment of the embryo was conducted. The parameters evaluated included the ability to visualize anatomical structures and a subjective assessment of the overall image clarity. The ability to view most organs was better with intrauterine sonography compared to transvaginal sonography, and this was especially true for the brain, spine, heart, liver, midgut herniation, extremities, and sacral tail. Moreover, it was possible to obtain finer image quality of very small embryonic structures with intrauterine sonography than with transvaginal sonography. Stomach, spleen, kidney, and bladder could not be depicted with both techniques. One cystic hygroma was diagnosed at 7 weeks 6 days using intrauterine sonography, but not with transvaginal sonography. Intrauterine sonography may provide additional information on the visualization of anatomical structures of the embryo in the early first trimester of pregnancy. In this limited series, one case of cystic hygroma was demonstrated and, thus, there is a potential for its use in the early detection of embryonic malformation. These results suggest that intrauterine sonography may be a valuable tool in imaging the early first-trimester embryo, complementing and not replacing transvaginal sonography in high-risk pregnancies.

TI  - Wilms tumor and multicystic dysplastic kidney disease.  
AB  - PURPOSE: There is ongoing controversy concerning the management of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, particularly with regard to the potential for malignant transformation. Our report fuels the debate by adding the 2 youngest patients in whom malignancy was present from birth or developed subsequently. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two well documented cases of malignancy associated with multicystic dysplastic kidney disease are presented in 2 female infants (5 and 3 months old). The 5-month-old female infant was followed for multicystic dysplastic kidney disease and had no evidence of tumor either antenatally or at birth. The 3-month-old presented with hypertension and interventricular septal defect. A renal tumor was present on initial ultrasound. RESULTS: Even though malignant degeneration is rare in multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, 9 cases have been reported in the literature so far. Of these cases 3 were Wilms tumor, 5 were renal cell carcinomas and 1 mesothelioma. CONCLUSIONS: Our 2 cases lend support to the surgical management of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, particularly as nephrectomy can now be performed in a day surgery setting with minimal morbidity. Only the risks of coexisting malignancy and possible malignant degeneration transformation are specifically addressed in this article. Other complications of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease such as hypertension, infection, abdominal pain, hematuria and persistent dysplastic renal tissue despite ultrasonographic resolution of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease are additional risk factors to be considered. A recommendation for nephrectomy in all cases of multicystic dysplastic kidney disease cannot be based only on these 2 cases. Several other factors must be weighed before making that decision.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the mechanism of transient shallow anterior chamber after vitreous surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. METHOD: Using ultrasound biomicroscopy, we examined a patient with transient shallow anterior chamber after vitreous surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: On the day after surgery, slit-lamp examination disclosed a shallow anterior chamber that persisted for 1 week and deepened thereafter.  Ultrasound biomicroscopy 5 days postoperatively disclosed a narrow angle in the peripheral anterior chamber and supraciliary fluid. At 14 days postoperatively, suprachoroidal fluid could not be detected, and the angle was wide. CONCLUSION: The shallow anterior chamber in this patient was caused by supraciliary fluid after vitreous surgery.

TI  - Small (1.5 cm or less) liver metastases: US-guided biopsy.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the techniques used for and the success of ultrasound (US)-guided biopsy of hepatic metastases 1.5 cm in diameter or smaller. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer search of radiology reports identified 29 patients who underwent US-guided biopsy of 30 hepatic masses 1.5 cm in diameter or smaller suspected to be metastases. All 30 lesions were sampled for biopsy with the free-hand technique. Parameters assessed were lesion size and location, needle size, transducer type, number of passes made, cytologic or histologic analysis, and final histologic diagnosis. Biopsies were considered successful if a positive histologic diagnosis of metastasis was made. RESULTS: The mean lesion diameter was 1.3 cm (range, 0.9-1.5 cm). Lesion depth was 3-9 cm (mean, 5 cm). Twenty biopsies were performed with a 22-gauge aspirating needle and analyzed cytologically. An average of 2.7 passes were made per lesion. Phased-array sector transducers were used in 23 lesions. In 28 (93%) lesions and 28 (96%) patients, an adequate specimen was obtained to establish the histologic diagnosis of metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: US appears to be an effective guidance technique for biopsy of small liver metastases.

TI  - Relation of coronary artery disease to atherosclerotic disease in the aorta, carotid, and femoral arteries evaluated by ultrasound.  
AB  - This prospective study was conducted to correlate the presence of angiographically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic disease in the aorta, carotid, and femoral arteries as measured by ultrasound. One hundred two consecutive patients admitted for coronary angiography for suspected CAD participated in the study. All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography for the evaluation of thoracic aortic atherosclerosis and B-mode ultrasound for evaluation of carotid and femoral atherosclerosis. Intimal-medial thickness > 1 mm in the thoracic aorta or peripheral vessels was considered as evidence of atherosclerosis. Patients with CAD (n = 64) had a significantly higher incidence of atherosclerotic plaques in the thoracic aorta, carotid, and femoral arteries than subjects with normal coronary arteries: 91%, 72%, 77% vs 31%, 47% and 42%, respectively. Extracoronary plaque was a stronger predictor of CAD than conventional risk factors. Evidence of plaque in patients younger than median age (64 years) had a higher specificity than in patients above median age (77% vs 40%, respectively, p <0.0001). Plaque score of the extracardiac vessels was significantly higher in patients with multivessel CAD than in patients with 1-vessel CAD disease and in subjects with normal coronary arteries (p <0.001). Thus, atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic and femoral arteries and, to a lesser extent, in the carotid arteries are strong predictors of CAD.

TI  - Use of fine needle aspiration for solid breast lesions is accurate and cost-effective.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Palpable breast tumors have traditionally been diagnosed with open biopsy or core biopsy. We propose fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) as a reliable, cost-saving initial procedure in these patients. METHODS: Eighty-five palpable solid breast masses of the breast in 85 patients were classified by a combination of physical examination, mammography, and/or ultrasound as probably benign, indeterminate, or highly suspicious for cancer. All tumors had FNA biopsies. All patients had either a confirmatory open biopsy (55) or close clinical follow-up (30) with a mean follow-up of 29 months (range 6 to 36). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients classified as clinically benign had a benign FNA biopsy. No cancers were detected in this group by either open surgical biopsy or clinical follow-up. Twenty patients were classified clinically as indeterminate. All had FNA biopsies, and 6 were either positive for cancer or suspicious for cancer. Fourteen patients had negative FNA biopsies. Five of the 6 abnormal biopsies had cancer on open biopsies. The 1 false-positive result occurred in a lactating patient. Thirty-one patients were classified clinically as highly suspicious for cancer. Twenty-three were confirmed as cancer with FNA biopsy. Eight needed open surgical biopsy to confirm cancer. All 31 patients clinically suspicious for cancer had cancer. In patients classified clinically as highly suspicious or probably benign, FNA was a reliable first diagnostic step (100% positive predictive value, 100% specificity, 87% sensitivity, and 89% negative predictive value). CONCLUSIONS: Fine needle aspiration biopsy of solid palpable breast lesions should be the diagnostic procedure of choice for those patients classified clinically as probably benign or clinically as highly suspicious for cancer. Cost analysis revealed elimination of an open biopsy in such cases would save $1,100 per patient. For highly suspicious cases, a negative fine needle aspiration should not deter an open surgical biopsy. For patients classified as indeterminate, fine needle aspiration biopsy results are not reliable enough to determine treatment.

TI  - A comparison between the patella and the calcaneus using ultrasound velocity and attenuation as predictors of bone mineral density.  
AB  - The bone mineral density (BMD), ultrasound velocity (UV) and attenuation were examined in sixteen matched sets of human patellae and calcanei. For the sixteen calcanei, BMD was strongly correlated with all ultrasound parameters. Calcaneal UV appeared to be inferior to attenuation in the ability to predict BMD. For the sixteen patellae, the average UV was found to be greater in the superior/inferior direction than in the anterior/posterior and medial/lateral directions. It was found that patella BMD was significantly correlated with each of three directional ultrasound velocities. The relationship between BMD and ultrasound attenuation parameters was not significant in the patella. A comparative study of the two different bone sets demonstrated that the BMDs of the patella and calcaneus were significantly correlated with each other. Ultrasound velocity of calcaneus, measured in the medial/lateral direction, was not significantly associated with any of three directional ultrasound velocities in the patella. Similarly, ultrasound attenuation parameters of calcaneus were not significantly correlated with those of patella. The present study also demonstrated evidence that when predicting BMDs at their respective sites using ultrasound, the calcaneus appeared to be superior to the patella.

TI  - Thyroid nodules in childhood and adolescence--thirty years of experience.  
AB  - In the thirty year period between 1966 and 1996, fifty-two patients underwent surgery for thyroid nodules at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. We aimed to review their presentation, investigation, histology, treatment and to follow up those who had malignant neoplasms. Forty-one of the fifty-two patients presented with a single thyroid nodule. Investigations performed included thyroid function tests (N = 32), thyroid autoantibodies (N = 21), an ultrasound of the thyroid (N = 26) and 99mTechnetium scanning (N = 32). Thirty-five of the neoplasms were benign, the follicular adenoma (N = 16) being the most common. Seventeen patients had malignant neoplasms, seven of whom had papillary and seven of whom had follicular carcinoma. Three patients had medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Nine of the seventeen patients with thyroid malignancy received post-operative 131I treatment. At the time of this review, all patients were living.

TI  - Balloon angioplasty combined with primary stenting versus balloon angioplasty alone in femoropopliteal obstructions: A comparative randomized study.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate whether balloon angioplasty combined with stenting (ST) of symptomatic femoropopliteal disease would provide better results compared with balloon angioplasty alone (BA). METHODS: Fifty-one patients were randomized between ST (24 patients) and BA (27 patients). Follow-up comprised clinical and hemodynamic assessment and color-flow duplex ultrasound examinations. RESULTS: Residual stenosis (> or = 30% diameter reduction) occurred in three BA patients, but not in the ST patients. By life-table analysis the cumulative rate of clinical and hemodynamic success after 1 year with ST was 74% (SE 9%) and for those with BA 85% (SE 7%) (p = 0.25). The primary patency at 1 year assessed by color-flow duplex ultrasound was 62% (SE 9%) for ST-treated patients and 74% (SE 8%) for BA patients (p = 0.22). Occlusion occurred in five ST patients (21%) compared with two BA patients (7%). CONCLUSION: ST does not improve clinical and hemodynamic outcome compared with BA. Moreover, the occlusion rate in ST-treated patients is higher.

TI  - Endoluminal repair of internal carotid artery aneurysm: a feasible but hazardous procedure.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the repair of an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery using the endoluminal method. METHODS: A 70-year-old male patient noted a swelling in the right side of his neck 22 years after endarterectomy of the right internal carotid artery.  Duplex ultrasound confirmed the clinical diagnosis of aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Further investigation included contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning and carotid angiography performed via a retrograde femoral approach. The aneurysm contained thrombus and was 3 cm in diameter and in length. It extended superiorly from a point 0.5 cm above the carotid bifurcation to a point estimated to be 2 cm from the base of the skull. Repair of the aneurysm was undertaken using the endoluminal method. A self-expanding endograft 8 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length was introduced through a 12F sheath in the common carotid artery. An on-table completion angiogram of the right-sided extracranial carotid arteries and the intracranial internal carotid artery and branches was obtained. RESULTS: The completion angiogram and postoperative CT scan confirmed exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the circulation. The patient awoke from anesthesia with complete paralysis of the left arm. Recovery of movement commenced 1 hour later. A brain CT scan demonstrated the event to be an embolic stroke. Strength had returned by 7 days. Function of the arm was good 1 month after operation, but coordination for fine movements was lacking. At the 6-month follow-up, good arm function was maintained. A duplex ultrasound scan demonstrated not only continued exclusion of the aneurysm sac but occlusion of the endograft, also. CONCLUSIONS: Endoluminal repair of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery is feasible but carries the risk of major morbidity as a result of peripheral embolization and early occlusion of the endograft.

TI  -  Intraoperative ultrasound assessment in management of complex pancreatic pseudocysts.  
AB  - Preoperative imaging studies and operative inspection may provide insufficient information to appropriately manage certain complex pancreatic pseudocysts. Intraoperative ultrasound accurately identifies and localizes peripancreatic fluid collections, cyst wall thickness, parenchymal and ductal anatomy, and relationships to adjacent visceral and vascular structures. Adjunctive use of intraoperative ultrasonography altered the surgical management in the clinical case described herein and is advocated for assessment of problematic pancreatic pseudocysts.

TI  - Effective blood flow and recirculation rates in internal jugular vein twin catheters: measurement by ultrasound velocity dilution.  
AB  -  The ultrasound dilution technology (Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY) is a reliable method to assess blood flow (Qb) and recirculation rates (R) in vascular access during hemodialysis. However, the information available on these parameters for central venous dialysis catheters remains scarce at this point. Real Qb and R were evaluated in 33 well-functioning TwinCath (Medcomp, Harleysville, PA) inserted as mid- or long-term hemodialysis vascular access (mean duration since insertion, 270 +/- 253 days); all were implanted into the right internal jugular vein with their multiperforated distal tips located in the superior vena cava or right atrium. Several types of dialysis machines were used (Monitral and AK100, Hospal-Gambro, Lyon, France; 2008E and 4008E, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). Real Qb was measured with the ultrasound dilution method and compared with the set Qb (indicated by the dialysis machine); R, also evaluated by ultrasound dilution, was evaluated at various Qb with nonreversed lines; therefore, a total of 121 measures were performed. Arterial and venous pressures (PA and PV) were recorded simultaneously. The 33 measures at a set Qb of 200 mL/min showed a mean effective Qb of 210 +/- 18 mL/min and a mean R of 5.3 +/- 5.3%. At a Qb of 300 mL/min, 33 repeated measures resulted in mean effective Qb of 303 +/- 21 mL/min and R of 8.5 +/- 7.0%; 28 measures performed at a set Qb of 350 mL/min showed that the effective Qb was 336 +/- 24 mL/min and that R was 7.8% +/- 6.7%. Finally, an effective Qb of 372 +/- 26 mL/min and an R of 10.9 +/- 8.6% were found for the 27 measures performed at an indicated Qb of 400 mL/min. The difference between indicated and effective Qb was particularly significant for set Qb equal to or above 350 mL/min (P < 0.001). Variable correlations were observed between obtained parameters: Qb eff and R (r = 0.34), PV and R (r = 0.36), Qb eff and PV (r = 0.78), Qb eff and PA (r = 0.71), and PV and PA (r = 0.53). In conclusion, TwinCath delivers an effective Qb of nearly 375 mL/min when Qb is set at 400 mL/min on most dialysis machines. Mean R in TwinCath varies between 5% and 11% for Qb within the range of 200 to 400 mL/min. In well-functioning TwinCath, the ratio between PV and Qb remains usually below 0.5.

TI  - Ultrasound-mediated destruction of contrast agents. Effect of ultrasound intensity, exposure, and frequency.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Although ultrasound contrast microbubbles theoretically could serve as tracers for the noninvasive quantification of blood flow, results have been inconsistent. Accurate quantification may be limited by ultrasound energy-mediated microbubble destruction. This study examined the effect of different ultrasound delivery parameters on microbubble destruction. METHODS: Experiments were performed in an in vitro hydraulic perfusion model consisting of a thin-walled rubber tube encased in agar. Ultrasonic parameters tested during different parts of the experiment were (1) intensity, (2) duration, and (3) frequency. Four ultrasound contrast agents: Aerosomes MRX115 (ImaRx Pharmaceuticals Corp., Tucson, AZ), Imagent AF0150 US (Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp., San Diego, CA), Levovist (Berlex Laboratories, Wayne, NJ), and Echogen (Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Bothel, WA) were imaged with three different ultrasound systems: ATL Ultramark AM-9 HDI, Vingmed 800 and Hewlett-Packard 2500. RESULTS: Microbubble destruction and reductions in reflectivity were noted in all agents tested. Although no significant reductions in counts or reflectivity occurred at 0.3 W/cm2 with any agent, exposure to 25 W/cm2 produced more than 80% reductions in both microbubble counts (P < 0.0001) and reflectivity (P < 0.0001). Declines in reflectivity were increased by longer exposure to ultrasound (P < 0.0001); slower flow through an ultrasound beam (P < 0.0001); continuous, rather than intermittent, imaging (P = 0.0002); use of a higher pulse repetition rate (P < 0.0001); and exposure to 2.5 MHz, rather than 7.5 MHz, ultrasound (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound energy-mediated destruction of contrast microbubbles is a function of many factors, including ultrasound intensity, duration, and frequency. Optimization of ultrasound delivery parameters may be used to maximize or minimize the destruction of ultrasound contrast agents.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Stabilized microbubbles are under development as contrast agents for medical ultrasound. The authors report the results of Phase I clinical trials of a new ultrasound contrast agent based on lipidencapsulated perfluorocarbon gas microbubbles. METHODS: Lipids encapsulating perfluoropropane gas (Aerosomes MRX-115, ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson, AZ) were evaluated in Phase I clinical trials. Two separate studies were performed. The first was a single escalating-dose study (n = 30 subjects), and the second was a multiple-dose study (n = 18 subjects) with rechallenge in several subjects (n = 4) after 21 days. Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and after contrast agent for each test drug administration for both studies, with the exception of the rechallenge group. Doses tested in the single-dose study ranged from 0.005 mL/kg to 0.100 mL/kg body weight. In the multiple-dose study, five doses of 0.005 mL/ kg to 0.030 mL/kg (0.025-0.150 mL/kg total dose) were evaluated. Studies were single-masked, placebo-controlled, and safety assessment and adverse events were monitored. RESULTS: All doses in both studies were well tolerated with no treatment-related changes in safety measures for either study. Left ventricular cavity and myocardial enhancement were seen with all doses of MRX-115. CONCLUSIONS: MRX-115 is a promising new intravascular ultrasound contrast agent that was safe and well tolerated at the doses evaluated in these studies.

TI  - Prediction of vertebral strength in vitro by spinal bone densitometry and calcaneal ultrasound.  
AB  - Spinal bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and calcaneal ultrasound were compared in terms of their ability to predict the strength of the third lumbar vertebral body using specimens from 62 adult cadavers (28 females, 34 males). BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in both vertebra and calcaneus. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) was used to determine trabecular BMD, cortical BMD, cortical area, and total cross-sectional area (CSA) of the vertebral body. Bone velocity (BV) and broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) were measured in the right calcaneus. Vertebral strength was determined by uniaxial compressive testing. Vertebral ultimate load was best correlated with DXA-determined vertebral BMD (r2 = 0.64). Of the QCT parameters, the best correlation with strength was obtained using the product of trabecular BMD and CSA (r2 = 0.61). For vertebral ultimate stress, however, the best correlation was observed with QCT-measured trabecular BMD (r2 = 0.51); the correlation with DXA-determined BMD was slightly poorer (r2 = 0.44). Calcaneal ultrasound correlated only weakly with both ultimate load and stress with correlation coefficients (r2) of 0.10-0.17, as did calcaneal BMD (r2 = 0.18). Both spinal DXA and spinal QCT were significantly (p < 0.001) better predictors of L3 ultimate load and stress than were either calcaneal ultrasound or calcaneal DXA. Multiple regression analysis revealed that calcaneal ultrasound did not significantly improve the predictive ability of either DXA or QCT for L3 ultimate load or stress. Calcaneal DXA BMD, bone velocity, and BUA correlated well with each other (r2 = 0.67-0.76), but were only modestly correlated with the DXA and QCT measurements of the vertebra. These data indicate that spinal DXA and spinal QCT provide comparable prediction of vertebral strength, but that a substantial proportion (typically 40%) of the variability in vertebral strength is unaccounted for by BMD measurements. Ultrasonic measurements at the calcaneus are poor predictors of vertebral strength in vitro, and ultrasound does not add predictive information independently of BMD. These findings contrast with emerging clinical data, suggesting that calcaneal ultrasound may be a valuable predictor of vertebral fracture risk in vivo. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro findings could be that current clinical ultrasound measurements at the calcaneus reflect factors that are related to fracture risk but not associated with bone fragility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To relate the histological composition of carotid artery plaques with morphology as evaluated by B-mode ultrasound. DESIGN: Prospective study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-eight symptomatic patients underwent carotid endarterectomy after preoperative ultrasound Duplex scanning evaluating plaque morphology. Morphometric analysis of the removed specimen was performed in order to quantify content of lipid, haemorrhage, calcification and fibrous tissue. RESULTS: Echolucent plaques contained more lipid (p = 0.01) and less calcification (p = 0.01) and fibrous tissue (p = 0.03) than echo-rich plaques. Intraplaque haemorrhage was directly related to lipid content (p = 0.004) and inversely related to amount of fibrous tissue in the plaque (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The intensity of the reflected B-mode ultrasound signal appears related to the histological composition of the plaque. The association between intraplaque haemorrhage and a high lipid content may support the theory of the lipid-rich plaque being more prone to rupture.

Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of kidney function in XLH patients with NC detected ultrasonographically has not been reported. We investigated two women with XLH, ages 31 (patient 1) and 39 (patient 2) years, each of whom had suffered at least one documented episode of vitamin D2-induced hypercalcemia and renal azotemia during childhood. Patient 2 had also been treated with inorganic phosphate. No medications for XLH had been taken during adulthood. Renal ultrasonography at our institution demonstrated marked bilateral medullary NC in both women. No other explanation was found for their NC that apparently occurred several decades earlier from medical therapy for XLH. Detailed studies (including creatinine clearance, beta2-microglobulin excretion, and fasting urinary osmolality and acidification) revealed no impairment of kidney function in either patient. Our findings indicate that subradiographic medullary NC acquired during medical therapy for XLH may persist for decades, but with no adverse renal sequelae. Definitive (long-term) assessment of kidney function in the XLH population with NC, however, will be necessary to fully understand the risk of current medical treatment for this most common heritable form of rickets.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess indium-111 leucocyte imaging and ultrasound in the investigation of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO), as well as the predictive value of available clinical information on the radiological outcome. 256 111In leucocyte scans performed over a 5 year period were reviewed. There were 59 scans in 58 patients who fulfilled recognized criteria for true PUO; 47 of these patients had ultrasound. In 15 patients the fever settled and no diagnosis was made; the source of PUO was infective in 20 and non-infective in 24. In the group as a whole, the sensitivities of leucocyte scan and ultrasound were 25% and 23% with specificities of 100% and 83%, respectively. In infective cases of PUO, the sensitivities were 20% for both modalities. There was no correlation between leucocyte count or differential, C reactive protein or the presence or absence of antibiotics. In the cases where the leucocyte scan led to the diagnosis of infection, the scan was performed within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms. The results show that an infective cause for PUO is established in less than 50% of cases. The leucocyte scan is specific and although not very sensitive can often be a guide to subsequent cross-sectional imaging. If an infective cause for the PUO is strongly suspected, 111In leucocyte scanning may be more sensitive if performed in the first few weeks of fever.

TI  - Cholelithiasis and pancreatic cancer. A case-control study.  
AB  - To study the possible association between pancreatic cancer and cholelithiasis, we conducted a retrospective case-control study.  Abdominal ultrasound of 100 consecutive cases of pancreatic cancer and that of 140 age- and gender-matched control subjects were examined by 2 observers who did not know the diagnosis. Thirty-seven patients with pancreatic cancer had cholelithiasis (37%), as compared with 23 (16%) of the control group (p < 0.001). The increased prevalence of gallstones in patients with pancreatic carcinoma remained significant when either male or female patients were compared (p < 0.02), as well as in the various age groups studied. For example, 30 (43.5%) of 69 patients 65 years of age and older had cholelithiasis versus 21 (22%) of 95 control subjects (p < 0.005). Thus, patients with pancreatic cancer were found to have a higher prevalence of gallstone disease than expected in a matched control population (relative risk, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3). This finding does not establish a causal link; however, the possibility should be pursued, more so because gallstones have been identified previously as likely risk factors for cancer in other parts of the biliary-pancreatic tract.

TI  - Hepatic veno-occlusive disease in pediatric stem cell recipients: successful treatment with continuous infusion of prostaglandin E1 and low-dose heparin.  
AB  - Limited data exist on therapeutic options for established hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in pediatric patients after stem cell transplantation (SCT). In this report, we present data on the successful treatment of VOD in three children following allogeneic SCT and report the duplex ultrasound criteria for the confirmation of the diagnosis and for the evaluation of the treatment progress. All patients were <2 years at the time of transplantation and had received preparative regimens containing busulfan and cyclophosphamide. There were no known pretransplant risk factors for VOD. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed from a sibling donor for CMML and from unrelated donors for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). The onset of first clinical symptoms of VOD (as defined by the Seattle and Baltimore criteria) was relatively late in all three patients (days +19, +20, and +25, respectively). Time from onset of first symptoms until confirmation of diagnosis by serial duplex ultrasound examination was 4-11 days.  Duplex ultrasound criteria are as follows: complete change of direction of blood flow in the portal vein, decrease of flow in the hepatic veins, and development of collateral circulation. Treatment was initiated upon confirmation of VOD by continuous infusion of prostaglandin E1 (initial dose 0.075 microg/kg/h) in addition to low-dose heparin (100 units/kg/d). Treatment was continued at the maximum tolerated dose of 0.3-0.5 microg/kg/h of PGE1. After 9, 14, and 25 days of treatment respectively, normal portal vein flow was restored and treatment could be discontinued. All three patients are alive and well without apparent sequelae.

TI  - High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy of the pars plana and peripheral retina.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the ability and role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in imaging the peripheral retina, pars plana, and anterior choroid. DESIGN: The study design was a case series. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen eyes of 17 patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses involving the anterior portion of the posterior segment were studied. INTERVENTION: High-frequency (50 MHz), high-resolution (50 microns) ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed. RESULTS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy was capable of imaging the peripheral retina, pars plana, and anterior choroid. Images had features consistent with known histopathology. Retinoschisis consisted of one thin hyper-reflective echo and could be differentiated from a retinal detachment, which was thicker and formed a bilayered echo. A choroidal effusion could be identified as an echolucent space within the suprachoroidea, whereas a choroidal hemorrhage was moderately echodense. Inflammatory diseases, such as a sarcoid granuloma, pars planitis, and Harada's disease, were characterized by different forms of uveal thickening. A ciliochoroidal nevus was internally hyporeflective and could be measured accurately and localized. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of the peripheral retina, pars plana, and anterior choroid is possible with ultrasound biomicroscopy and may aid in the diagnosis and management of pathology involving this region.

The sister presented with fetal ultrasound findings of severe ascites and peritoneal calcifications. She had no prenatal intervention and was born at 38 weeks' gestation. Laparatomy revealed perforation of the terminal ileum with meconium peritonitis. Her post-surgical course was uncomplicated and at 30 months of age her growth and development are normal. Her brother presented prenatally with signs of meconium peritonitis including severe ascites and peritoneal calcifications. Prenatal aspiration of the ascitic fluid was performed and unlike his sister he was born prematurely, was operated on at 8 days, and developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. He is currently 1 year old and has normal growth and development. The aetiology of the ileal perforation is not known. There were no findings suggesting connective tissue disorder and the aetiology of the intestinal perforation is not known. The occurrence of the same rare abnormality in sibs of different sexes points towards an autosomal recessive disorder.

PMID- 9504228
TI  - Has the use of home monitors, fetal fibronectin, and measurement of cervical length helped predict labor and/or prevent preterm delivery in twins?  
AB  - Home monitoring accurately detects contractions, and thus is useful in predicting preterm labor. Appropriate physician action is necessary to significantly prolong pregnancy even in the presence of evidence of excessive contractions. Despite conflicting studies, the majority of evidence heavily favors the use of monitoring as part of a comprehensive preterm birth prevention program. Indeed, monitoring has greater clinical utility in twin gestations because of the recognized propensity for preterm labor. Fetal fibronectin is one of the most sensitive and specific markers for preterm labor and subsequent early delivery presently available. It appears to be equally effective in multifetal gestations compared with singleton gestations, but intervention trials are needed to substantiate its clinical effectiveness. Cervical status monitoring by ultrasound correlates inversely with preterm labor, but studies in twin gestation are currently lacking. Other markers, such as salivary estriol for preterm labor, have yet to be assessed as predictors of preterm labor among multifetal gestations.

TI  - [Dynamic interstitial laser application for therapy of secondary liver tumors. An animal experiment study]  
AB  - Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors. To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed. This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source. The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator. In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.  Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo. However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound. Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital. The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis. In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged. As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed. The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.

DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, "sham" controlled trial with assessments at baseline, after 2 weeks' and 7 weeks' treatment, and at a follow up assessment 6 months later (8 months after baseline evaluation). SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a university department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in Vienna. SUBJECTS: 45 patients with mild to moderate bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as verified by electroneurography. INTERVENTION: 20 sessions of ultrasound (active) treatment (1 MHz, 1.0 W/cm2, pulsed mode 1:4, 15 minutes per session) applied to the area over the carpal tunnel of one wrist, and indistinguishable sham ultrasound treatment applied to the other. The first 10 treatments were performed daily (5 sessions/week); 10 further treatments were twice weekly for 5 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Score of subjective symptom ratings assessed by visual analogue scale; electroneurographic measures (for example, motor distal latency and sensory antidromic nerve conduction velocity). RESULTS: Improvement was significantly more pronounced in actively treated than in sham treated wrists for both subjective symptoms (P < 0.001, paired t test) and electroneurographic variables (motor distal latency P < 0.001, paired t test; sensory antidromic nerve conduction velocity P < 0.001, paired t test). Effects were sustained at 6 months' follow up. CONCLUSION: Results suggest there are satisfying short to medium term effects due to ultrasound treatment in patients with mild to moderate idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. Findings need to be confirmed, and ultrasound treatment will have to be compared with standard conservative and invasive treatment options.

TI  - Timing of computed tomography-based postimplant assessment following permanent transperineal prostate brachytherapy [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish the rate of resolution of prostatic edema following transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy, and to determine the results and impact of timing of the postimplant assessment on the dose-volume relationship. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A series of 19 consecutive patients with early-stage adenocarcinoma of the prostate receiving transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy, were enrolled in this study. Twelve received 125I and seven received 103Pd. Postoperative assessment included a computed tomographic (CT) scan on postoperative days 1, 8, 30, 90, and 180. On each occasion, CT scans were performed on a GE helical unit at 3-mm abutting slices, 15-cm field of view. Prostate volumes were outlined on CT scans by a single clinician. Following digitization of the volumes and radioactive sources, volumes and dose-volume histograms were calculated. The prostate volume encompassed by the 80% and 100% reference isodose volumes was calculated. RESULTS: Preimplant transrectal ultrasound determined volumes varied from 17.5 to 38.6 cc (median 27.9 cc). Prostate volumes previously defined on 40 randomly selected postimplant CT scans were compared in a blinded fashion to a second CT-derived volume and ranged from -32% to +24%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for prostate CT volume reproducibility was 0.77 (p < 0.03). CT scan-determined volume performed on postoperative day 1 was an average of 41.4% greater than the volume determined by preimplant ultrasound. Significant decreases in average volume were seen during the first month postoperatively. Average volume decreased 14% from day 1 to day 8, 10% from day 8 to day 30, 3% from day 30 to day 90, and 2% thereafter. Coverage of the prostate volume by the 80% isodose volume increased from 85.6% on postoperative day 1 to 92.2% on postoperative day 180. The corresponding increase in the 100% reference dose coverage of the prostate volume ranged from 73.1% to 83.3% between postoperative days 1, and 180, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the prostatic edema induced by brachytherapy appears to resolve by postoperative day 30. Scans performed on postimplant day 30 appear to adequately describe the time-averaged dose coverage of the prostate. This suggests that waiting approximately 1 month to perform postimplant analysis gives the most accurate prostatic volume and, consequently, dosimetric description of the implant.

TI  - Reported comfort with obstetrical emergencies before and after participation in the advanced life support in obstetrics course.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prior research has demonstrated a change in Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) course attendees' reported comfort with managing specific obstetrical emergencies and procedures before and immediately after participation in an ALSO course. Assessment of longer-term stability of these changes has not been performed. This study measured changes in comfort with obstetrical emergencies and reported practice patterns 1 year after ALSO training. METHODS: ALSO course attendees (275) were given a grounded Likert scale survey measuring reported comfort with the management of specific obstetrical emergencies and procedures before, immediately after, 6 months after, and 1 year after participation in an ALSO course. Practice patterns were also surveyed. Paired data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test at a 95% confidence interval for two-tailed significance. RESULTS: ALSO course participants reported a significant increase in their comfort with the management of each of 15 obstetrical emergencies and procedures taught in the ALSO curriculum. Reported comfort remained high at 6 months' and 1-year follow-up and was accompanied by a statistically significant change in reported practice patterns; more participants performed, in their practice 1 year after completion of ALSO training, amnioinfusion, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, and ultrasound for determining fetal position and placental location. CONCLUSIONS: Affective learning is important in translating knowledge and skills into the practice of medicine. Our study demonstrates that participation in the ALSO course increases participants' knowledge in the affective domain of learning.

TI  - Validation of automated contour analysis of intravascular ultrasound images after vascular intervention.  
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of automated contour analysis of intravascular ultrasound images obtained after vascular intervention. STUDY DESIGN: This was a descriptive study. METHODS: Intravascular ultrasound images obtained from patients after balloon angioplasty (n = 10), stent (n = 10), or stent graft placement (n = 10) were analyzed. A comparison was made between lumen area measured with an automated and a manual system. The location showing the smallest lumen area derived from the automated system was compared with the smallest lumen area selected by visual estimation. RESULTS: Images containing a dissection as a result of balloon angioplasty could not be analyzed by the automated system. The coefficient of variation between the lumen area measurements obtained with the automated system and the manual tracing system of images with a stent (n = 76) or stent graft (n = 79) was 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively. Correlation between the two systems was high (r = 1.00, p < 0.01) both for images containing stents or stent grafts. Minimum lumen area measured with the automated analysis system was smaller than minimum lumen area selected by visual estimation (mean difference 0.8 mm2 (4.9%) for stents and 2.4 mm2 (10.9%) for stent grafts). The location of the smallest lumen area determined with both systems was the same (<1 cm) in 16 cases and differed more than 1 cm in 4 other cases. CONCLUSIONS: The automated analysis system shows good agreement with manual contour analysis of lumen area in images with a stent or stent graft and is a reliable tool for determination of the smallest lumen area. The system is not able to analyze an irregular-shaped lumen area caused by a dissection.

TI  - Should peri-operative infra-inguinal graft duplex scans be routinely performed? [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability of duplex ultrasound graft surveillance to detect graft stenosis is well documented. However, the optimal time to commence duplex ultrasound graft surveillance is not clear. METHODS: An early duplex ultrasound study was performed on 90 infra-inguinal bypass grafts within 2 weeks of surgery. Further duplex scans were performed at intervals after surgery of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and then annually. An ankle/brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) was performed before the infra-inguinal bypass and then 24 h after the surgery. The ABI was also routinely measured at the time of each graft duplex examination. RESULTS: Six graft thromboses (6.7%) were demonstrated on the first graft duplex within 2 weeks of the surgery. The 24-hour postoperative resting ABI were less than 0.5 in all six cases. Significant graft stenoses (> 50%) or native artery diseases were detected in six cases (6.7%) on the first graft scan (proximal anastomosis stenosis, 1: mid-graft stenosis, 3; peroneal artery stenosis, 1; popliteal artery occlusion, 1). The resting ABI was less than 0.5 in one of these cases. Vein patch angioplasty was performed on graft stenosis in two cases following the first duplex scan. In 78 cases with either normal or minimal graft/native artery stenosis (< 50%), the resting ABI were less than 0.5 in only two cases (2.6%). The first graft duplex ultrasound examinations were technically difficult or gave a poor image in 21 cases (23.3%). During the subsequent graft duplex follow-up, seven graft thromboses were demonstrated at an average of 5.9 months after surgery (1-12 months). Significant stenosis (> 50%) was demonstrated in 10 additional cases at an average of 8.5 months after surgery (1-12 months). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present study do not support routine peri-operative graft duplex scanning in addition to a 1-month graft duplex scan. Early postoperative resting ABI should be routinely performed. If the resting ABI is less than 0.5, an immediate duplex scan should be carried out to assess graft integrity. A long-term non-invasive graft surveillance programme is important in the detection of graft stenosis.

TI  - On what grounds do women participate in prenatal screening?  
AB  - Along with the rapid biomedical development of prenatal screening tests, target groups' attitudes and decision-making about, and the acceptance of, screening procedures have come into focus. To understand users' decision-making, it is essential to understand users' knowledge and perceptions of a procedure. The aim of this study was to examine Finnish women's knowledge and perceptions of, and stated reasons to participate in, two prenatal screening tests: serum screening and mid-trimester ultrasound screening. Subjects (n=1035) for the serum screening survey were catered for in the maternity care centres of two Finnish towns, where serum screening is available for all pregnant women. After one reminder, 88 per cent returned the questionnaire. Subjects (n=497) for the mid-trimester ultrasound screening survey were catered for in the obstetrical and gynaecological outpatient clinic of the city hospital of another town; the response rate was 85 per cent. Women's perceptions of the studied prenatal screening tests, serum screening and mid-trimester ultrasound screening, differed significantly, even though both are used to detect fetal malformations. Serum screening was far more often perceived to be connected with finding diseases or abnormalities than ultrasound screening. Another interesting finding was that the stated reasons for screening in general and the subjective reasons for participation were different. Reassurance was the personal reason most often mentioned in both the serum screening and the ultrasound group. Almost all women had the most superficial knowledge about serum screening; they knew whether it had been offered and that it is done to screen for Down syndrome. The greatest gaps in knowledge concerned the sensitivity of serum screening, its use in screening for congenital nephrosis, and diagnostic tests and their risks. Knowledge was poorer among women without a high school education. When counselling women about prenatal screening tests, more emphasis should be given to the sensitivity of serum screening, all of its screening uses, and the possible diagnostic tests and their risks. The fact that ultrasound screening can detect conditions which may lead to the possibility of a selective abortion should also be explained more fully.

TI  - Relationships between bone mass measurements and lifetime physical activity in a Swedish population.  
AB  - Lifetime occupational and leisure time activities were assessed by a questionnaire in order to evaluate their relationship to bone mass measurements and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in a population of 61 women and 61 men, randomly selected from a Swedish population register, to represent ages between 22 and 85 years. We also considered possible confounders by using questions about smoking habits, milk consumption, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and menopausal age. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (bone mass, BMC) of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur (neck, trochanter, Ward's triangle) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and BMD of the forearm with single energy X-ray absorptiometry (SXA). In addition, both DXA and SXA provided information on bone area.  Quantitative ultrasound measurements (QUS) at the heel were performed to assess the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA). Fasting blood samples were analyzed for biochemical markers of bone metabolism as well as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and total serum calcium. After adjustment for confounding factors, neither BMD nor QUS measurements were consistently related to lifetime leisure time or occupational activities; nor were there any consistent patterns relating biochemical markers of bone metabolism to bone mass measurements. However, physical activity seemed to influence bone mass, area, and width more than density. In men, high levels of leisure time activity were associated with raised values for lumbar spine area (6.2%) and width (3.3%) as well as for femoral neck area (5.5%) compared with their low activity counterpart. Men exposed to high levels of occupational activity demonstrated lower lumbar spine BMD (10.9%) and area (5.3%) than men with low activity levels. Within an unselected Swedish population, estimation of lifetime occupational and sport activities as well as bedrest, using a questionnaire, demonstrated no major effects on bone density. However, the association between high levels of lifetime activity and raised values for bone mass, area, and width indicate that geometrical changes in bone may provide better estimations of mechanically induced bone strength than bone density, at least in men.

TI  - Transcutaneous high-intensity focused ultrasound and irradiation: an organ-preserving treatment of cancer in a solitary testis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of transcutaneous ablation of human testicular tissue by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). METHODS: Transcutaneous ablation of human testicular tissue by HIFU was performed with equipment previously developed for transrectal prostate ablation. This device utilizes a piezoceramic transducer operating at 4.0 MHz with a site-intensity of 1,600-2,000 W/cm2. To study the histological impact of transcutaneous HIFU, tests of 4 patients with prostate cancer were subjected to transcutaneous HIFU-therapy prior to scrotal orchiectomy in a phase I trial. In a phase II clinical trial, 4 patients with the typical sonographic pattern of a tumor in a solitary testis were treated with transcutaneous HIFU as a minimally invasive organ-preserving approach followed by a 6 weeks' course of prophylactic irradiation of the testis with 20 Gy. In all 4 patients, the contralateral testis had been previously removed for testis cancer. RESULTS: Histologically, HIFU-treated areas exhibited signs of cellular necrosis in all cases (n = 4). The border between viable and necrotic tissue was extremely sharp comprising only 5-7 cell layers. In the phase II clinical study, we aimed to ablate the entire cancer in a single therapeutic HIFU session. HIFU treatment was performed under general anesthesia. As negative side effects we observed a cutaneous thermolesion in 1 individual. One patient refused to undergo postoperative irradiation and developed a local failure. This patient underwent radical orchiectomy. Another patient received two cycles of chemotherapy for a single suspicious retroperitoneal lymph node diagnosed 6 months after HIFU therapy. Three patients are tumor-free with a follow-up of 16, 23 and 31 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of transcutaneous testicular tissue ablation by HIFU. Despite the major drawback of this technique, i.e. that no tumor histology is obtained, we believe that transcutaneous HIFU followed by irradiation has the potential to be established as a minimally invasive treatment alternative to organ-preserving surgery for tumors in a solitary testis.

TI  - Use of intravascular ultrasound improves long-term clinical outcome in the endovascular management of atherosclerotic aortoiliac occlusive disease.  
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) during balloon angioplasty and stenting of atherosclerotic aortoiliac occlusive lesions improved long-term clinical outcome. IVUS has been previously shown to be more accurate than arteriography in evaluating the deployment of stents in both peripheral and coronary arteries. Incomplete stent deployment has been anecdotally identified as a cause of restenosis or occlusion of a treated lesion. To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies that demonstrate whether the use of IVUS will affect the long-term patency rate of stented arterial lesions. METHODS: Between March 1992 and October 1995, 52 patients with symptomatic aortoiliac occlusive disease underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of their lesions. We retrospectively reviewed these cases to determine whether the use of IVUS influenced the long-term patency rate of these interventions. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years with a mean of 28 months. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients had confirmation of adequate stent deployment by arteriography. IVUS was used in conjunction with arteriography in 36 patients to evaluate stent deployment. Patients in the IVUS-assisted group were slightly younger than those patients who were evaluated solely by arteriography (p < 0.01). No statistical differences were noted between the two groups with respect to coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or obesity. Length of hospital stay, number of stents used, and preoperative ankle brachial indexes were comparable in both groups. In the arteriography plus IVUS group, 40% of patients had underdeployed stents by IVUS evaluation, though they appeared adequately expanded by arteriography. No restenoses or occlusions were seen in the arteriography plus IVUS group. Restenosis or occlusion of the stented lesion occurred in 25% of patients evaluated by arteriography alone (p < 0.01). These failures were treated by either thrombolysis or catheter thrombectomy and were then evaluated with IVUS. All were found to have underdeployed stents. Subsequent treatment consisted of adequate redeployment of existing stents using IVUS criteria. These salvaged reconstructions have continued to remain patent. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IVUS may be the best means for assessing adequacy of arterial stent deployment. Our study suggests that the use of IVUS improves the long-term clinical outcome of balloon angioplasty and stented aortoiliac occlusive lesions.

TI  - ERCP imaging.  
AB  - Localization and spread of pancreatic diseases has been a reality since the availability of endoscopic pancreatography in the late 1960s, particularly after development of a fiberscope for this purpose. Endoscopic pancreatography allowed the clinician to discern the position and site of cancers, cysts, and localized inflammations. Ductal anomalies, such as annular pancreas, nonfusion, and anomalous junction of pancreatobiliary connection, were clearly recognized also. The pancreatography opacified the real lumen instead of the virtual images of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), so that precise studies comparing histopathologic details could be performed. The pancreatic ductal information visualized by using the fiberscope changed our understanding of chronic inflammation of the pancreas. Chronic diffuse pancreatitis, upstream pancreatitis, ductitis, and duct-narrowing pancreatitis were specified from their pathogenetic differences. Although the noninvasive methods such as US and CT will be the first choice for the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases, pancreatography will still be important for the morphologic studies of the pancreas in various disease conditions.

TI  - Three-dimensional imaging in aortic disease by lighthouse transesophageal echocardiography using intravascular ultrasound catheters. Comparison to three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography and three-dimensional intra-aortic ultrasound imaging.  
AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and 2D intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging face their greatest limitation in visualizing aortic disease in patients. With the aid of three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction, TEE and IVUS can potentially overcome this limitation but still provide only limited spatial appreciation in aortic disease because 3D imaging of the thoracic aorta requires a broader spatial visualization of the mediastinum than provided by both techniques. Moreover, for timely decision making about aortic disease TEE is limited by a large probe, which requires sedation. Therefore, we developed an approach called 3D lighthouse transesophageal echocardiography (LTEE) using a thin intravascular ultrasound catheter, which provides a full circumferential (360 degree) image and requires no sedation. The purpose of this study was to compare the feasibility and accuracy of 3D TEE, 3D IVUS, and 3D LTEE for obtaining spatial visualization of the thoracic aorta to detect aortic diseases in patients. 3D image datasets were obtained for 3D LTEE by a manual pullback of a 3.3 mm thick, 10 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter positioned in the esophagus; for 3D TEE using a conventional 15 mm thick probe; and for 3D IVUS using a 2.6 mm thick, 20 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter. In 12 consecutive patients, three with aortic dissection (two with type III, one with type I) and 11 with suspected artherosclerosis, we analyzed and compared spatial visualization of the thoracic aorta, 3D image quality, patient discomfort, and study time. Providing a 3D dataset of 360-degree tomographic images of the mediastinum, 3D LTEE was the only approach that allowed broad spatial visualization of the aortic arch (9 of 12 patients) with the detection of aortic dissection or atherosclerotic plaques. Spatial visualization of the aortic arch by 3D TEE was incomplete because of the relatively narrow 90-degree image sector. However, in other segments 3D image quality by 3D TEE was superior to 3D LTEE and 3D IVUS. Because of the thin catheter, patient discomfort (p < 0.0001) and examination time (p = 0.015) were significantly less for 3D LTEE compared with 3D TEE. 3D LTEE is a promising new technique for 3D imaging of the thoracic aorta and detection of aortic disease with improved spatial visualization and reduced patient discomfort compared with 3D TEE and 3D IVUS.

TI  - Effects of lowering average of below-average cholesterol levels on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis: results of the LIPID Atherosclerosis Substudy. LIPID Trial Research Group [published erratum appears in Circulation 1996 Jun 23;97(24):2479]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesterol lowering in patients with above-average cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis and lower the risk of coronary heart disease events. However, there has been uncertainty about the effects of cholesterol lowering in patients with average or below-average cholesterol levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 522 patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina and with baseline levels of total cholesterol between 4 and 7 mmol/L (mean, 5.7 mmol/L) were randomized to treatment with a low fat diet plus pravastatin (40 mg daily) or to a low fat diet plus placebo. Treatment with pravastatin reduced the levels of total cholesterol by 19%, LDL cholesterol by 27%, apolipoprotein B by 19%, and triglycerides by 13% (all 2P<.0001) and increased apolipoprotein A1 and HDL cholesterol levels by 4% (both 2P<.0005), in comparison with placebo. Carotid atherosclerosis was assessed from B-mode ultrasound measurements of the common carotid artery. After 4 years, mean carotid wall thickness had increased by 0.048 mm (SE=0.01) in the placebo group and declined by 0.014 mm in the pravastatin-treated group (SE=0.01) (2P for difference <.0001). The effect of treatment on wall thickness was similar in three groups classified by tertiles of total cholesterol at baseline, with mean levels of 4.8, 5.7, and 6.6 mmol/L, respectively (2P for interaction >.8). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pravastatin reduced the development of carotid atherosclerosis among patients with coronary heart disease and a wide range of pretreatment cholesterol levels. Treatment with this agent prevented any detectable increase in carotid wall thickening over 4 years of follow-up.

TI  -  Ultrasound for the early diagnosis of tibial fracture healing after static interlocked nailing without reaming: histologic correlation using a canine model [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound is thought to be clinically useful in evaluating bone formation through its presumed identification of fracture callus. However, documentation of the actual histology of the tissue identified by ultrasound has been lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the histologic composition of the hyperechoic tissue "seen" by ultrasound. STUDY DESIGN: Unilateral fractures were created in eight canine tibias and then fixed by using locked intramedullary nailing without reaming. The limbs were studied at two, three, four, six, and eight weeks postoperatively with plain radiographs, ultrasound, and ultrasound-directed needle biopsy. RESULTS: The presence of a hyperechoic ultrasound signal was found to have a 100 percent correlation with the presence of hard fracture callus biopsy tissue. In addition, fracture union by ultrasound criteria significantly predated radiographic fracture union (5.6 vs. 7.3 weeks, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results support and provide a scientific basis for the clinical use of ultrasound to assess tibial fracture healing following static interlocked nailing without reaming.

AB  - In Japan, clinical and basic investigations of Albunex were started from 1989, and was firstly approved by the government as a commercially available contrast agent for the cardiovascular disorders. Although it has recently evacuated from the market, its acoustic properties proven by the many investigators were valuable for preparation of the second generation of contrast agents. Therefore, we summarized our data of the ultrasonic properties of Albunex both in vitro and experimental dog studies using RF signals. In conclusion, Albunex was a extremely sensitive blood flow tracer in evaluating intracardiac blood flow as well as intramyocardial perfusion.

TI  - Application of the surface rendering technique of three-dimensional ultrasound in prenatal diagnosis and counselling of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.  
AB  - Klippel Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is a complex developmental disorder characterized by a triad of cutaneous haemangioma, varicosities of the body, and unilateral limb hypertrophy. We describe the prenatal diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome at 15 weeks' gestation using the surface rendering technique of three-dimensional ultrasound. The vivid three-dimensional images of the affected fetus are invaluable in prenatal diagnosis and parental counselling.

TI  - The history of ultrasound.  
AB  - Diagnostic medical ultrasound may have a brief history, but its roots date back to the early nineteenth century. From its modest beginnings in military institutions where ultrasound was used to examine pathologic specimens, to the routine evaluation of the fetus, injured patients, and those with cerebrovascular disease, ultrasound has secured a position as a key diagnostic test both currently and in the future. Its ability to diagnose valvular and congenital heart disease has reduced the need for invasive cardiac angiography with its attendant risks. Furthermore, endoluminal, transvaginal, transrectal, and transesophageal ultrasound have expanded physicians' diagnostic armamentarium and ability to "look inside" their patients. Notwithstanding all these advancements, ultrasound research and development continue to be fostered, and the ideas of today will be the technology of tomorrow (Fig. 5).

AB  - Because it is unique in being portable, rapid, and noninvasive, ultrasound is particularly suited to the trauma setting. When performed by the surgeon, it offers immediate feedback that can be incorporated into the management plan for the patient. Multiple studies in this area have now documented that surgeons can perform and interpret focused ultrasound examinations. Enthusiasm for surgeons as ultrasonographers will likely increase now that the Advanced Trauma Life Support Subcommittee of the American College of Surgeons has published an algorithm that includes ultrasound for the assessment of patients with blunt truncal injuries. As a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for the detection of pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, and hemoperitoneum, ultrasound is now an integral part of the practice at many Level I trauma centers.

TI  - Very high frequency ultrasound analysis of a new phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens in situ.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To use very high frequency ultrasound scanning for in situ analysis of a new phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens (No-Touch; International Visions Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio). METHODS: In this pilot study, very high frequency ultrasound (50 MHz) wide-angle (15 mm) full anterior segment scans were obtained in two patients who had undergone phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation into legally blind eyes with normal anterior segment anatomy. RESULTS: Very high frequency ultrasound B-scan images delineated the phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens within the posterior chamber. The relations to the sulci were clearly imaged. Anatomic relations of the phakic posterior chamber intraocular lens optic and haptics were visualized in both static (light/dark) and kinetic (distance/accommodative) states. CONCLUSION: Very high frequency ultrasound wide-angle scanning provides a unique tool to noninvasively evaluate the eye preoperatively and the static and kinetic relations of this new refractive device within the posterior chamber.

TI  - Postnatal follow-up of hydronephrosis detected by prenatal ultrasound: the natural history.  
AB  - Babies with hydronephrosis detected antenatally who were born at or referred to our hospital from 1990 to 1995 were followed up with ultrasound (U/S), micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) or nuclear medicine studies after birth. One hundred and three patients were diagnosed antenatally at 17-42 weeks gestation. Twelve cases were excluded from the analysis of the results because of incomplete data. Fifty-one (56%) patients had hydronephrosis without organic obstruction, and 80% of these became normal in 3 years. Fifteen patients (17%) had a normal scan 4 days after birth. This suggests the possibility of antenatal spontaneous regression. Seven (8%) had a ureterocele and 4 (5%) had pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. Four (5%) had vesicoureteric reflux, and 4 (5%) had primary megaureter. Two (2%) had posterior urethral valves (PUV), 3 (3%) had refluxing primary megaureter, and 1 (1%) had urethral atresia. Fifteen patients (17%) underwent surgical intervention. Six had a nephrectomy, 1 a vesicostomy, 3 an Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty, 3 had the ureterocele unroofed, 1 had a ureteric reimplant, and 1 ablation of valves. In 42 infants with 60 abnormal kidneys, the renal anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis was measured. Retrospectively, 48 kidneys diagnosed as having hydronephrosis, antenatally had a renal pelvis diameter > or = 4 mm before 33 weeks gestation or > or = 7 mm after 33 weeks gestation. One patient with PUJ obstruction lost kidney function, but there is no good marker to detect these patients. Early unroofing of ureteroceles may rescue kidney function. Our follow-up protocol for antenatal hydronephrosis is U/S at 4 days, 1 month and 1 year of age. An MCU is not required unless the ureter is seen on antenatal U/S. If dilatation persists past 1 month, a radionucleotide (MAG3) scan and repeat U/S are performed at 3 months. The methods for assessing obstruction and the indications for surgical intervention in these patients require reexamination.

AB  - AIM: Functional assessment of endothelium by endothelium-dependent and non-endothelium dependent response of the brachial artery (BA) in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ACUSON 128 XP/10 unit furnished with linear meter with phase grid (7.0 MHz) was employed in two-direction scanning mode to measure BA diameter at rest, under reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent response) and after sublingual intake of 0.01 mg of nitroglycerin (non-endothelium-dependent response) in 12 patients with blood hypertension (group 3), 10 subjects with family hypercholesterolemia (group 2) and 10 healthy subjects (group 1, control). RESULTS: The flow-dependent dilatation remained unchanged in BH patients (9.4%) and lowered in HCE patients (3.0%) compared to controls (9.5%). Nitroglycerin-induced dilatation was not significantly different in patients with family hypercholesterolemia (16.6%), hypertensive subjects (14.5%) and healthy controls (20.5%). CONCLUSION: The ultrasound method of detection of endothelial dysfunction is demonstrated. Endothelial dysfunction in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may contribute to development of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Utility of three-dimensional ultrasound Doppler flow reconstruction of the proximal jet to quantify effective orifice area: in vitro steady and pulsatile flow studies.  
AB  - We examined the utility of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of two-dimensional color Doppler images of the proximal jet to quantify the effective area of an orifice in an in vitro model. Steady and pulsatile flows were directed through various orifices; orifice vena contracta areas were quantified with laser flow visualization, thus providing gold standard effective orifice areas. Three-dimensional areas followed vena contracta areas well, although variations in color Doppler gain and 3D gray levels for thresholding produced significant changes in reconstructed images. These variations were minimized by using minimum color gain and 50% gray level threshold. At these settings, 3D areas still overestimated vena contracta areas by approximately 25% because of the poor lateral resolution of the color Doppler system, which caused bleeding of the flow signal past the edges of the proximal jet. Nevertheless, 3D flow images provided a superior format for qualitative and quantitative appreciation of proximal jet shape and dimensions.

TI  - Bone status assessed by quantitative ultrasound in healthy postmenopausal Polish women: normative data.  
AB  - In this study, ultrasound measurements of the calcaneus of 712 healthy postmenopausal Polish women aged 50-85 years (mean age 59.5 years) were performed. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) were obtained with a Lunar Achilles machine. The women in the study were volunteers evaluated at the Osteoporotic Centre for screening purposes. The results showed a decrease in ultrasound values within the age range 52-74 years for BUA (9.8%) and SOS (1.9%). Simple linear regression analysis showed a negative, significant correlation with age for BUA (r=-0.36) and SOS (r=-0.38). Years since menopause (YSM) showed significant correlations with BUA and SOS (r=-0.33 and -0.35, respectively). Using multiple regression analysis, the following equations were obtained: BUA=66.04 - 0.31Age + 0.06Weight - 0.18 YSM + 0.27Height + 0.52 Body mass index and SOS=1547.17 - 1.02Age + 0.38Weight - 0.48 YSM. Several weak, but significant, correlations between ultrasound values and weight, height and body mass were noted (r ranged from 0.09 to -0.29). A decrease of ultrasound values was expressed mainly in the first 6-10 years of the postmenopause period. The pattern of this decrease was similar to data published by other authors, but values in postmenopausal Polish women are slightly lower.

TI  - The NPL Doppler fetal heart beat detector test facility.  
AB  - There are many thousands of Doppler fetal heart beat detectors in medical use and many different detector manufacturers but, until recently, there has been no well-defined quantitative method for measuring the sensitivity of these detectors and, therefore, no way of directly comparing their technical performance under standardised test conditions. At NPL, we have developed a reference test facility for measuring detector sensitivity to meet the needs of manufacturers, and to comply with the requirements of an international standard (IEC 1995) that defines methods of measurement of the sensitivity of fetal heart beat detectors. The test facility has primarily been developed for detectors operating at a transmitted frequency of 2 MHz and with Doppler shifts of up to 1 kHz. The detectors are tested by directing the ultrasound beam at a small moving target being driven at a constant velocity, and then monitoring the output signal from the detector, which will be at the Doppler shift frequency. To determine the sensitivity, attenuators are inserted into the beam until the output signal is reduced to 6 dB above the noise level. The sensitivity is calculated by adding the final signal level above the noise to the total insertion loss of the attenuators in the ultrasound path and the reflection loss of the target. A crucial aspect of this calculation is the knowledge of the target strengths and characteristics. This has already been extensively studied (Preston and Bond 1997) over the frequency range of interest. The NPL test facility developed for undertaking the sensitivity measurements is described, including an assessment of the uncertainties in such a measurement and solutions to problems encountered along the way.

TI  - High-frequency ultrasound properties of multicellular spheroids during heating.  
AB  - High-frequency ultrasound monitoring is a possible method for real-time imaging of thermal therapy in tissues at microscopic resolution. The objective of this work was to measure changes in the ultrasound properties of V79 spheroids (grown from Chinese Hamster lung fibroblasts) exposed to heating. Spheroids are clonal aggregates of cells that provide a useful model for investigating the ultrasound properties of cells in the absence of connective tissue. Relative echo signal power and attenuation coefficients were measured over the frequency range 30 MHz to 70 MHz, from spheroids heated from 37 degrees C to 50 degrees C or 60 degrees C. Echo signal power from the viable rim decreased during the first 5 min by a factor of 1.08 before the spheroid reached 50 degrees C. For the next 25 min, echo signal power rose to a factor of 1.27 above the initial level, after which it remained relatively constant over the remainder of the 50 degrees C heating period. At 60 degrees C, echo signal from the viable rim remained relatively constant, although it appeared to have possibly decreased slightly over the duration of the heating period. Echo signal power from the necrotic core fell to a factor of 1.4 and 1.54 below the initial level at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. First-order chemical rate analysis applied to the echo signal power results in the viable rim at 50 degrees C revealed a rate constant for the 5-15-min heating interval. Interpretation of the echo signal power results in terms of histological stains indicates that the rise in echo signal power at 50 degrees C was due to a loss of cell cohesion, and the possible drop in echo signal power at 60 degrees C was due to spheroid coagulation. Attenuation coefficients decreased by up to 1.54 dB mm-1 over a 30-min period at 60 degrees C. The appearance of a real-time ultrasound image of lesion formation in cells is discussed.

TI  - Standard properties of ultrasound contrast agents.  
AB  - A standardization procedure for in vitro acoustic characterization of ultrasound contrast agents is presented. One new acoustic parameter for particular importance is retained: This is STAR, scattering-to-attenuation ratio, for quantification of the effectiveness of the contrast agent. The STAR expresses the ability of the contrast agent to enhance the visualization of the tissue containing the contrast agent and, at the same time, represents the degree of its absorption. So, it is desirable to produce a contrast agent with high STAR, having good scattering properties to improve the image visualization, and low attenuation to image the underlying biological structures and to avoid shadowing. In this study, we present methods for calculations and measurements of the STAR and comparison between different contrast agents.

TI  - Influence of anthropometric parameters and biochemical markers of bone metabolism on quantitative ultrasound of bone in the institutionalized elderly.  
AB  - The assessment of bone quality by quantitative ultrasound (QUS), a transportable and relatively cheap method, shows some correlations with bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and with fracture risk. To examine its correlation with bone metabolism in a population of institutionalized elderly people known to be at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism, QUS of the calcaneus and biochemical parameters were measured in 264 women aged 85 +/- 7 (SD) years and in 103 men aged 81 +/- 8 years living in 19 nursing homes. Vitamin D deficiency was frequent in this population: 41.9% of the women and 31.4% of the men had a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25OHD) level below the 2.5th percentile level of 3276 normal Swiss adults (6.2 micrograms/l or 15.5 mmol/l). Hyperparathyroidism was less frequent: serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were above the 97.5th percentile level of normal adults (70 pg/l) in 18.9% of women and 9.8% of men. In women, QUS data correlated significantly with age (r = -0.297), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.403), calcium (r = 0.220), PTH (r = -0.296), 25OHD (r = 0.298) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) (r = -0.170) for broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and with age (r = -0.195), BMI (r = 0.208), PTH (r = -0.174), 25OHD (r = 0.140) and AP (r = -0.130) for speed of sound (SOS). In men, ultrasound data correlated with BMI (r = 0.326), calcium (r = 0.199), 25OHD (r = 0.258) and AP (r = -0.311) for BUA, and with AP (r = -0.196) for SOS. In women, but not in men because of their smaller number, a multivariate analysis was performed to examine relationships between age, BMI, biochemical markers and QUS. Age, BMI, PTH and phosphate explained 30% of the variance of BUA and 10% for SOS. In conclusion, QUS of bone evaluates characteristics of bone that are influenced, at least partially, by age, BMI and the secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency.

TI  - [Hydrosonography as an alternative or supplement to endosonography in stomach carcinoma]  
AB  -  Transabdominal ultrasound in the hydrotechnique (hydrosonography) was compared with endosonography for the locoregional staging of gastric cancer. For this purpose 52 consecutive patients were examined by endosonography (7.5 and 12 MHz) and hydrosonography (3.75 MHz). Forty-nine of the 52 tumors could be examined by endosonography and 41 by hydrosonography. The T-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 74% and 46% for hydrosonography. Carcinoma of the cardia are often classified as uT3 and hT3 preoperatively and pT2 postoperatively due to infiltration of the subserosal fat. The N-staging accuracy rate of endosonography was 86% and 61% for hydrosonography. Based on these results, transabdominal ultrasound in the hydrotechnique (hydrosonography) cannot replace endosonography in gastric cancer staging. However, when performed in conjunction with conventional ultrasound, hydrosonography provides useful information about the local tumor stage, especially in cases of advanced and stenotic tumors.

TI  - [The role of season in the incidence of deep venous thrombosis]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The question of the role of season as a predisposing factor for development of venous thromboembolic disease still remains a matter of debate. Actually, most reports described a higher incidence of thrombotic disorders in winter, while a recent study showed no seasonal variation in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These data led us to study the seasonal distribution of all outpatients with DVT admitted to our Department over a period of 14 years. METHODS: Retrospective review of the files of all outpatients with confirmed (venography or ultrasound) DVT of the legs admitted from Jan. 1st 1982 to Dec. 31st 1995 (n = 512; mean age 59.4 years; 49.4% women). RESULTS: DVT occurred in spring in 135 (26.4%), in summer in 104 (20.3%), in autumn in 142 (27.7%) and in winter in 131 (25.6%) patients. This distribution appears to be similar to an expected uniform distribution [chi 2(3) df = 6.48; p = 0.090 (NS)]. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, by investigating retrospectively 512 outpatients with confirmed DVT, no correlation was found between season and development of thrombosis, suggesting that cold seasons do not represent a predisposing factor for DVT. Further large prospective studies are needed in order to validate our data and to investigate the clinical implications and the precise role of the season in the risk of occurrence of venous thrombosis.

TI  - Intravascular ultrasound diagnosis of aortic graft infection.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the value of intra-aortic ultrasound (US) for diagnosing intraprosthetic vegetations in atypical aortic graft infection. METHODS: A 66-year-old man presented with fever 12 months after emergency insertion of a straight infrarenal aortic graft because of rupture of an inflammatory abdominal aneurysm. Blood cultures, leukocyte scan, transabdominal US study, and digital angiography were negative. Spiral CT was equivocal. The patient was imaged with a mechanically rotating US transducer at 12.5-MHz from inside the graft. RESULTS: Intravascular catheter ultrasound showed mobile lesions at the graft wall in the absence of periprosthetic fluid. Immediately after the procedure the patient developed several small cutaneous septic infarctions on both feet. At operation the presence of graft infection was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that intra-aortic US may constitute a helpful adjunctive modality in suspected atypical infection of prosthetic aortic grafts.

TI  - Consequences of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis: a preliminary report on neonates with congenital malformations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis in neonates referred for surgery, and to test whether a prenatal versus postnatal diagnosis influenced mode of delivery and neonatal outcome of these infants. PATIENTS: Thirty-six consecutive neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, abdominal wall defects, bladder exstrophy and meningomyelocele were included. RESULTS: The sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound for diagnosis of the congenital malformations was 7/36 (19%) at 17-18th week of gestation, and overall 13/36 (36%). Overall sensitivity was 2/8 in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 6/12 in neonates with abdominal wall defects, 5/13 in neonates with meningomyelocele, whereas none of three cases with bladder exstrophy were detected prenatally. No significant improvement in neonatal morbidity was found comparing the prenatally and postnatally diagnosed groups. The neonatal survival rate was 10/13 (77%) in the prenatally diagnosed group and 22/23 (96%) in the postnatally diagnosed group (p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of prenatal ultrasound in diagnosing the congenital malformations under study in a low risk population was 19% at 17-18th week of gestation and 36% throughout the pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis altered management of labor, but caused no improvement in neonatal outcome.

TI  - Ultrasound diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis.  
AB  - In acute viral hepatitis, ultrasound examination of the liver also reveals pathologic changes of other organs, especially of the gallbladder and, less frequently, of the pancreas and regional lymph hilar nodes. Ninety patients divided into 3 groups of 30 patients each, suffering from viral hepatitis (group 1), acute calculous cholecystitis (group 2) or liver cirrhosis (group 3), were prospectively analyzed. An increased gallbladder wall thickness of 4.67 +/- 0.66 mm was recorded in all group 1 patients. In the group with acute viral hepatitis, gallbladder wall thickening was only present during the first week of the disease, and was almost two-fold thinner than that found in the group with acute calculous cholecystitis, where it ranged from 4.3 to 10.3 mm. The gallbladder wall thickening in cirrhosis patients was found to depend on liver decompensation during the course of cirrhosis.

TI  - Assessment of infective urinary tract disorders.  
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, particularly in the youngest age groups. There is a risk for progressive deterioration of renal function in these children if aggravating factors such as gross reflux and/or outflow obstruction of the urinary tract are present. In this review the pros and cons of available scintigraphic and radiological imaging techniques for the work-up of these children are presented.  Ultrasound can be used in the acute phase to exclude obstruction but can not reliably show transient or permanent parenchymal lesions. The presence of reflux can be established with X-ray or direct nuclide cystography. The X-ray technique gives good morphological information and has a grading system with prognostic relevance. Both techniques are invasive and great care must be taken to keep the radiation burden down with the X-ray technique. Indirect nuclide cystography following a renographic study is non-invasive but has a lower sensitivity than direct techniques. More experience is needed with the indirect technique to evaluate the consequences of its apparently low sensitivity. Urography has a limited place in the acute work-up of urinary tract infection but can be used to look for renal scarring 1-2 years after an acute pyelonephritis. The 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan can be used during the acute UTI to show pyelonephritic lesions with good accuracy and/or during the follow-up after six months to show permanent lesions. The acute DMSA scan can be omitted. An early treatment is more important than an early scan!

TI  - The effect of angulation on intravascular ultrasound imaging observed in vascular phantoms.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify the error introduced by noncoaxial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging and to evaluate the use of a balloon-tipped catheter in compensating for intraluminal angulation and subsequent dimensional inaccuracy. METHODS: The effect of noncoaxial IVUS imaging was investigated in both a polyvinyl chloride phantom and an in vitro canine aorta using a calibrated setup to measure angulation off axis. Imaging was performed at increasing angulation (creating an elliptical image) in both phantoms, with the transducer centered and off center. Diameters were compared to the original coaxial diameter, as well as calculated diameters based on specific angles off axis. The percentage change (error) was also calculated at these angles. The measurements were repeated using a balloon-tipped catheter to center the transducer. RESULTS: The measured diameters and percentage changes compared closely with their calculated counterpart. Up to 25 degrees off axis, the apparent increase in diameter measurement was nearly 10%. Angulation from 30 degrees to 70 degrees resulted in an increase of 15% to 192%. Use of the centering balloon reduced the amount of error by 70% to 85% but was limited to angles < or = 25 degrees due to the design of the test apparatus. CONCLUSIONS: The error introduced by noncoaxial IVUS imaging can be significant and may be partially corrected by the use of a centering balloon. Further studies in the clinical application of a centering device are warranted.

TI  - 99mTc-white cell scanning to detect gut inflammation in children with inflammatory bowel diseases or spondyloarthropathies.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gut inflammation is a common feature shared by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and the spondyloarthropathies (SpA). The aim of the present study was to compare the reliability of a number of non-invasive investigations for the detection of an inflammatory process of the intestine. METHODS: Forty-two children were studied: (i) patients with a previous diagnosis of IBD (group A); (ii) patients with suspected IBD (group B); and (iii) patients with predominantly rheumatological manifestations associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (group C). All the patients were studied using 99mTechnetium-HMPAO labelled white cell scanning (99mTc-WCS), and abdominal ultrasound (US). In addition the ESR, serum class A immunoglobulins, faecal occult blood (OB) and faecal alpha 1-antitripsin level (F alpha 1-AT) were determined. Colonoscopy plus multiple biopsies and radiological study of the intestine were used as gold standards. RESULTS: 99mTc-WCS showed the highest sensitivity (85%) and specificity (100%) in detecting the presence of gut inflammation. This was followed by ESR and faecal occult blood (63% sensitivity, 44% specificity), F alpha 1-AT (43% sensitivity, 44% specificity) and IgA (42% sensitivity, 88% specificity).  Ultrasound was informative in 28% of the active/affected patients, with a specificity of 75%. CONCLUSION: Although ileo-pancolonscopy remains the gold standard for the histological characterisation of gut inflammation, 99mTc-WCS represents the most reliable non-invasive test for its detection.

TI  - On-line pork carcass grading with the Autofom ultrasound system.  
AB  - On-line pork carcass grading with the Autofom ultrasound system is described. The system consists of 16 ultrasound transducers positioned in a frame. The carcass is measured fully automatically at 3,200 positions to a depth of approximately 12 cm with a depth resolution of .19 mm. The ultrasound data form a three-dimensional ultrasound image, which is processed for noise reduction, orientation detection, and extraction of 127 features describing the carcass composition. The image features are used in a multivariate regression model, that is used for on-line predictions. On-line tests performed at line speeds up to 1,150 carcasses/h provide predictions of the meat percentage with an accuracy of 1.58 to 1.95%. Good predictions of the fat thickness and primal meat cuts have also been made.

TI  - Role of fine-needle aspiration biopsy in breast lesions: analysis of a series of 4,110 cases.  
AB  - From January of 1990 to December of 1992, 6,954 consecutive cytologic breast fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) were performed at the Laboratory of Pathology of Sant'Anna Hospital in Turin. Of these cases 62% were solid nodes, 35% were cystic nodes, and 2.7% were nonpalpable breast lesions (stereotaxic or ultrasound guided FNAB). We verified 4,110 cases: 913 cases underwent surgery and 3,197 were evaluated clinically, and/or cytologically, and/or with mammography at least 1 yr after the first diagnosis, or checked with the database of the Tumor Registry of Turin. In our series the FNAB sensitivity was 94.6%, specificity was 99.9%, accuracy was 98.8%, inadequate samples were 6.4%, false-negative rate was 1.4%, and false-positive rate was 0.3%. Our results indicate that the use of cell block improves sensitivity (from 85.2 to 94.6%) and strongly reduces false-negative results (from 3.9 to 1.4%). We conclude that FNAB is a discriminant procedure to the surgical biopsy in cases with clinical, ultrasound, or mammographic low or intermediate suspect, contributing to allow a high malignant/benign surgical biopsy rate and to reduce the need for frozen section diagnosis and medical costs.

TI  - A simple model for learning stereotactic skills in ultrasound-guided amniocentesis.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amniocentesis is an important procedure for antenatal diagnosis but requires stereotactic skill acquisition that may be facilitated by the use of a model. TECHNIQUE: A model using a gelatin mold with "targets" within is created. The model is used to facilitate development of stereotactic skills and to demonstrate technique principles for ultrasound-guided amniocentesis. EXPERIENCE: The model has been incorporated into an educational program for antenatal diagnosis within a residency and provides a reasonable simulation of clinical features important in learning genetic amniocentesis. CONCLUSION: The use of this model augments the learning of important skills needed for ultrasound-guided amniocentesis.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of pancreatic masses: results of a multicenter study.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the results of ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of pancreatic masses in a large multicenter series. METHODS: This study collected the data of 510 patients who had a final diagnosis available and who had undergone ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the pancreas. Retrieval rate, sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy of the whole series, by three different bioptic procedures (cytology, histology, and cytology plus histology) were evaluated. The reliability of ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy to allow a correct diagnosis in the different pancreatic pathologies was calculated. Finally, any complications were collected. RESULTS: For cytology, histology, and cytology plus histology, retrieval rate values were: 94%, 96%, and 97%; sensitivity was: 87%, 94%, and 94%, specificity: 100%; and diagnostic accuracy: 91%, 90%, and 95%, respectively. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy correctly diagnosed all the cases of pancreatic metastases or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (23 of 510 cases as 5%; in eight of 23 it led to the first diagnosis of the primary tumor) and all the cases of abscesses, 97% of the cases of pseudocysts, 86% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 62% of cystic neoplasms, 35% of the cases of chronic pancreatitis (in this case, the bioptic procedures were reviewed), and 33% of neuroendocrine tumors. There were complications in one case of asymptomatic peripancreatic hematoma, three cases of vaso-vagal reactions, and 21 cases of pain. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the pancreas is efficacious, without any difference between the various bioptic modalities (with the exception of chronic pancreatitis, in which histology is better). The technique is safe. Moreover, the procedure allows the identification of patients affected by pancreatic tumors other than adenocarcinoma (in our survey 5% of the total); in about one third of these patients it leads to the diagnosis of the primary tumor, thus avoiding inappropriate treatments.

TI  - Detection of high intensity transient signals (HITS): how and why?  
AB  - HITS (high intensity transient signals) in transcranial Doppler recordings reflect either microemboli, both gaseous and solid, or artefacts. Various frequencies in number of microembolic signals (MES) have been reported in the same clinical condition. A possible explanation for these discrepancies may be different device settings and algorithms for embolus detection. For reproducibility of data, we suggest that studies on MES report the following parameters: (1) Ultrasound device; (2) transducer type; (3) insonated artery; (4) insonation depth; (5) algorithms for signal intensity measurement; (6) scale settings; (7) detection threshold; (8) axial extension of sample volume; (9) fast Fourier transform (FFT) size (number of points used); (10) FFT length (time); (11) FFT overlap; (12) transmitted ultrasound frequency; (13) high pass filter settings; and (14) recording time. No current system of automatic embolus detection has the full sensitivity and specificity required for clinical use. Therefore, each of the signals detected by these devices needs to be checked and verified by an experienced investigator. MES will help to identify the site and activity of the embolizing lesion. Microembolus detection might reduce the observation time and the number of patients needed to perform interventional trials. First, however, MES needs to be validated as a meaningful prognostic parameter. Microemboli originating from prosthetic cardiac valves are mainly gaseous. Therefore, they cannot serve as an indicator of the valves thromboembolic activity or the patient's stroke risk. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Direct in vivo visualization of intravascular destruction of microbubbles by ultrasound and its local effects on tissue.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to observe ultrasound-induced intravascular microbubble destruction in vivo and to characterize any resultant bioeffects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intravital microscopy was used to visualize the spinotrapezius muscle in 15 rats during ultrasound delivery. Microbubble destruction during ultrasound exposure caused rupture of < or = 7-microm microvessels (mostly capillaries) and the production of nonviable cells in adjacent tissue. The number of microvessels ruptured and cells damaged correlated linearly (P<0.001) with the amount of ultrasound energy delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Microbubbles can be destroyed by ultrasound, resulting in a bioeffect that could be used for local drug delivery, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling, or for tumor destruction.

TI  - Imaging modalities in Peyronie's disease. An intrapersonal comparison of ultrasound sonography, X-ray in mammography technique, computerized tomography, and nuclear magnetic resonance in 20 patients.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peyronie's disease is an ill-understood condition afflicting men in their 40s with the reported age ranging from 18 to 68 years. It is characterized by a plaque in the tunica albuginea which leads to penile deformity making sexual intercourse difficult if not impossible and is often accompanied by severe pain upon erection in the early stage; erectile dysfunction is present in about 2% of cases. Diagnosis rests upon medical history, clinical examination with plaque palpation and autophotography in two planes. These diagnostic steps are not plaque-specific and therefore we wanted to assess which imaging modalities would allow for an objective determination of the plaque status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 20 patients with Peyronie's disease. All patients underwent clinical examination including autophotography and the subsequent use of the following imaging techniques: (1) ultrasound (US) using a 7.5-MHz transducer with a profile for semiquantitative density analysis; (2) X-ray in mammography technique in two planes; (3) computerized tomography (CT) with a density profile, and (4) magnetic resonance imaging (NMR). RESULTS: (1) Degree of deviation: Penile deviation ranged from 15 degrees to 63 degrees. It was best assessed using radiography in mammography technique reflecting the results obtained by autophotography. (2) Calcifications: Plaque calcifications were seen in 12 patients, 8 had no calcifications but thickening of the tunica albuginea only, 2 also had a fibrosis of the corpus cavernosum distant to the plaque. Calcifications were visualized using ultrasound sonography (12/12), radiographically (12/12), CT (12/12), NMR (9/12). Thickening of the tunica albuginea only was visualized using ultrasound sonography (7/8), radiographically (0/8), CT (2/8), NMR (6/8). (3) Morphological pattern in ultrasound: Three distinct patterns could be detected: (type 1) the plaque appeared as a thickening of the tunica albuginea without acoustic shadowing and only minimal density increase in the histogram profile; (type 2) moderately calcified plaque with typical ultrasound shadow but minimal density increase in the density profile; (type 3) severely calcified plaque with typical acoustic shadowing and density increase in the histogram profile. (4) Plaque inflammation: Only NMR with gadolinium DTPA showed periplaque inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution ultrasound sonography is the best imaging modality in assessment of plaques. NMR is the modality of choice to monitor the inflamed plaque. X-ray in mammography technique and CT are not necessary in daily routine.

TI  - Enhancement of thrombolysis in vivo without skin and soft tissue damage by transcutaneous ultrasound.  
AB  - Previous studies have shown that transcutaneous ultrasound enhances thrombolysis by streptokinase in animals in vivo; however, skin and soft tissue damage induced by ultrasound energy has been a major limitation. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of thrombolysis and damage to skin and soft tissues using a newly designed concentrated ultrasound system with a cooling manifold. Using a rabbit model with iliofemoral arterial thrombotic occlusions, 15 pairs of arteries were randomized to receive ultrasound treatment or no ultrasound treatment. Streptokinase (25,000 unit/kg) was given intravenously. Skin temperature was maintained at 25-33 degrees C when ultrasound energy was applied. The serum level of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, red blood cell counts, and platelet counts were checked at baseline, after thrombus induction, and after ultrasound treatment. Fifteen of fifteen (100%) iliofemoral arteries were angiographically recanalized after ultrasound treatment. In contrast, only 1/15 (6.7%) contralateral arteries were patent after 1 hour. After the subsequent hour with heparin the patency was 14/15 in the ultrasound treated group and 3/15 in the control group. Histologically, the patent arteries had only minimal focal mural thrombus, whereas the angiographically occluded arteries had occlusive thrombi. There was no histologic evidence of ultrasound induced damage to overlying skin, soft tissues, or arteries. In addition, there was no significant rise of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, or decrease in red blood cell counts and platelet counts induced by ultrasound. In conclusion, transcutaneous concentrated ultrasound which significantly enhances streptokinase induced thrombolysis in vivo can be delivered without concomitant tissue damage. This simple combination therapy has clinical potential for safely treating patients with arterial or venous thromboses.

TI  - [Full working capacity instead of threatened retirement. Thrombendarterectomy in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension]  
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 56-year-old man in marked right heart failure (stage III-IV of the New York Heart Association classification) and severe pulmonary hypertension was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic for therapeutic and social-medical assessment. On physical examination the important features were markedly distended neck veins, tachycardia at rest (90/min), a loud 2nd pulmonary sound and dyspnea. INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: Non-invasive tests (ECG, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound and lung functions) confirmed right heart failure; invasively obtained haemodynamic data indicated its severity. Selective pulmonary angiography defined the embolisation to be central and bilateral. TREATMENT AND COURSE: As intensive drug treatment and physiotherapy had failed to achieve significant improvement, operative removal of the bilateral central and some segmental pulmonary thrombi was performed and an inferior vena caval filter inserted. Immediately after operation the markedly elevated right-heart and pulmonary artery pressures fell markedly and there was dramatic improvement in the patient's general condition and in his physical capacity. Angiography demonstrated largely normal pulmonary perfusion. Instead of the anticipated retirement, the patient was discharged on anticoagulants, in the expectation of a return to full-time work. CONCLUSION: With pulmonary thrombendarterectomy severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension may well be treated.

TI  - Laparoscopic and intraoperative ultrasound.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative ultrasound has gradually expanded in the last two decades to a variety of surgical specialties and has gained an established role in many surgical procedures. Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic ultrasound are the latest modes of intraoperative sonography. They have been introduced mainly to overcome the two major drawbacks of laparoscopy, i.e. the capability of showing only the surface of the organs and the lack of manual palpation of the anatomical structures. We review and discuss the established and the most recent applications of intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The technology, new indications and results of intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound are reviewed. This review is based on the experience gained in our Institution during more than 500 surgical procedures and the analysis of the literature on the subject. RESULTS: The yield of intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound consists in confirming preoperative studies and acquiring new data which would not be available otherwise. An important role of these techniques is determining the anatomy of the involved organs, thus providing a guidance for surgery. Both techniques have an important role in surgical decision-making, particularly with respect to hepatic, biliary and pancreatic malignancies. In some series the rate of major changes in the surgical strategy can be as high as 38%. A relatively new application of intraoperative ultrasound is the possibility to perform interstitial therapy of tumors at the time of the initial surgery. This can be useful, for example, in patients undergoing liver resection, when other unresectable lesions are found in a different segment or in the contralateral lobe. Finally, laparoscopic sonography has an important role in staging abdominal neoplasm, providing more information than preoperative imaging and laparoscopic exploration. This feature can be used to effectively stage gastrointestinal malignancies, pancreatic carcinoma, and abdominal lymphomas. CONCLUSION: The application of intraoperative ultrasound will increase in the era of minimally access surgery and this will be dependent not only on technical improvements in ultrasound technology. Indeed, it may be expected that a variety of open procedures will be performed with videolaparoscopic monitoring and will need the guidance of laparoscopic sonography. In the future, the staging of abdominal neoplasm may be markedly improved by laparoscopy combined with laparoscopic ultrasound; however a cost-benefit analysis of these techniques and a comparison with preoperative tests should be carried out.

TI  - Scintimammography with 99mTc-MDP: experience of the National Cancer Institute of Naples.  
AB  - The role of scintimammography with 99mTc-MDP was investigated in patients with mammographic or clinical evidence of breast lesions, suspicious for malignancy, in our Department at the National Cancer Institute of Naples. The end-point of the study was to assess the uselfulness of this test in diagnosing or ruling out breast cancer in more than 2000 women. Scintimammography results were compared with those of mammography and ultrasound and categorized according to histological findings. Overall sensitivity was 92%, specificity was 90%, and accuracy 91%. Sensitivity was affected by the lesions exceeding 12 mm and specificity by sclerotic and/or hyaline or myxoid fibroadenomas, which may be positive. The major advantages of scintimammography appeared in the study of calcifications without a mass and of the indirect mammographic signs of breast cancer, such as distortion and asymmetry. Scintimammography with 99mTc-MDP is a reliable, safe and highly cost-effective procedure to diagnose or to rule out breast cancer, after mammography and ultrasound have yielded questionable results.

TI  - Reliability of assessment tools in rehabilitation: an illustration of appropriate statistical analyses.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a practical guide to appropriate statistical analysis of a reliability study using real-time ultrasound for measuring muscle size as an example. DESIGN: Inter-rater and intra-rater (between-scans and between-days) reliability. SUBJECTS: Ten normal subjects (five male) aged 22-58 years. METHOD: The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the anterior tibial muscle group was measured using real-time ultrasonography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ICCs, and Bland and Altman method for assessing agreement, which includes calculation of the mean difference between measures (d), the 95% CI for d, the standard deviation of the differences (SDdiff), the 95% limits of agreement and a reliability coefficient. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability was high, ICC (3,1) was 0.92 with a 95% CI of 0.72 --> 0.98. There was reasonable agreement between measures on the Bland and Altman test, as d was -0.63 cm2, the 95% CI for d was -1.4 --> 0.14 cm2, the SDdiff was 1.08 cm2, the 95% limits of agreement -2.73 --> 1.53 cm2 and the reliability coefficient was 2.4. Between-scans repeatability was high, ICCs (1,1) were 0.94 and 0.93 with 95% CIs of 0.8 --> 0.99 and 0.75 --> 0.98, for days 1 and 2 respectively. Measures showed good agreement on the Bland and Altman test: d for day 1 was 0.15 cm2 and for day 2 it was -0.32 cm2, the 95% CIs for d were -0.51 --> 0.81 cm2 for day 1 and -0.98 --> 0.34 cm2 for day 2; SDdiff was 0.93 cm2 for both days, the 95% imits of agreement were -1.71 --> 2.01 cm2 for day 1 and -2.18 --> 1.54 cm2 for day 2; the reliability coefficient was 1.80 for day 1 and 1.88 for day 2. The between-days ICC (1,2) was 0.92 and the 95% CI 0.69 --> 0.98. The d was -0.98 cm2, the SDdiff was 1.25 cm2 with 95% limits of agreement of -3.48 --> 1.52 cm2 and the reliability coefficient 2.8. The 95% CI for d (-1.88 --> -0.08 cm2) and the distribution graph showed a bias towards a larger measurement on day 2. CONCLUSIONS: The ICC and Bland and Altman tests are appropriate for analysis of reliability studies of similar design to that described, but neither test alone provides sufficient information and it is recommended that both are used.

TI  - [Ultrasonography as a diagnostic measure in the rupture of fibular ligaments. Comparative study: sonography versus radiological investigations]  
AB  - PURPOSE: The present prospective clinical study was designed to verify the value of ultrasound examination concerning injuries of the fibular ligaments of the ankle using functional examinations under ultrasound supervision. METHOD: 34 patients who had sustained a lesion of the fibular ligaments of the ankle were compared with 42 healthy persons. The lateral malleolus and the collum tali were used as reproducible bony landmarks in ultrasound. The distance between those two points is first of all was measured in neutral position and later on under the influence of supinating force of 15 kp using a Telos fixation device. RESULTS: The average lateral opening of the upper ankle joint measured with the dynamic ultrasound examination was 4.4 mm (1-12 mm) in the group of patients who had been suffering from rupture of the fibular ligaments. In comparison the average lateral opening of the healthy contralateral ankle was 3.9 mm (1-9 mm). The control group showed an average lateral opening of 0.9 mm (0-5 mm). CONCLUSION: Direct ultrasonic visualisation of the fibular ligament is not yet reliable. The described method allows an estimation of the stability of the fibular ligaments even in cases of chronic instability. The ultrasound investigation method discussed is difficult to handle and for that reason it cannot replace the standardised x-ray examination.

TI  - Prevalence and structure of ultrasound curricula in emergency medicine residencies.  
AB  - Emergency medicine (EM) residency program directors were surveyed to determine the presence and structure of curricula for teaching ultrasound to EM residents. For those EM programs without an ultrasound curriculum (USC), information was requested on plans to implement one within the next 12 months. Ninety of 116 (78%) EM programs replied to the survey. One-half of EM residencies surveyed have USCs, and another 30% plan to implement one in the near future.

TI  - Gabor spectra for Doppler echocardiography.  
AB  - Doppler echocardiography on current ultrasonography machines makes use of short-time Fourier spectrograms (STFTs) to display the patterns of blood velocities in the heart chamber. From these sonologists infer the functional parameters, such as valve area, that have pathological significance. After mention of the lacuna in such an STFT display, the Gabor transform and associated Gabor spectrogram evaluation techniques are described. Finally, comparative views of ultrasound machine display with PC-based STFT and Gabor displays for two typical patients are shown, with inferences in support of the proposed Gabor display.

TI  - [The importance of using the cerebral function monitor (CFM) in the neurological prognosis of neonates in intensive care]  
AB  - Cerebral function monitor (CFM), unlike traditional EEG, allows a long-term evaluation of electric brain activity, without interfering with the nursing of the newborn in the intensive care unit. Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic value of CFM for neurological outcome. We studied 102 newborns (gestational age 34.5 +/- 4.36 weeks; weight 1980 +/- 720 grams) by Multitrace CFM (Lectromed) 5 hours daily in the first week following admission. The patients also underwent cerebral echography, EEG and neurological follow-up to the 24th month. CFM was found to correlate well with the EEG recorded 3 months later. The persistence for at least one week of an I.C. tracing or the normalization of initial tracing have a good prognostic value (positive predictive value 95.23%), a persistently pathologic registration has a negative prognostic value (negative predictive value 85.18%), that even increases if cerebral echographic alterations are demonstrated (98.57%). The association of CFM and ultrasound abnormalities determines a relative risk for neurological motor impairment of 69.14, whereas CFM alone gives a relative risk of 6.4.

AB  - Histologic findings from two consecutive series of fine-needle biopsies of nonpalpable breast lesions were compared. The first series included 243 tumors sampled stereotactically, and the second 198 tumors sampled under ultrasound guidance. The results, together with data from the literature, demonstrated that: 1) the diagnostic efficacy of stereotactic fine-needle cytology of lesions seen on mammograms only as microcalcifications is inadequate; 2) ultrasound-guided fine-needle cytology is an extremely reliable diagnostic tool for lesions that are not seen only as microcalcifications.

TI  - Chromosomal analysis of early fetal losses in relation to transvaginal ultrasonographic detection of fetal heart motion after infertility.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) detection of fetal heart motion (FHM) in view of maternal age and chromosomal analysis of spontaneously aborted fetal tissue. DESIGN: A 3-year retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING: Two medical center-based infertility-care facilities. PATIENT(S): 336 pregnancies were initiated by intrauterine insemination or embryo transfer for women of reproductive age who were seeking infertility treatment. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): beta hCG levels measured > 40 mIU/mL at 4-5 weeks' gestation and were followed by an initial TVUS at 5-8 weeks. Of these pregnancies, 52 ended in a first trimester loss. Twenty were defined by failure to detect FHM by 7 weeks' gestation (Group I), and 32 were marked by the loss of prior FHM at a mean of 2.6 weeks later (Group II). Fetal tissue was removed by dilatation and suction curettage. Cytogenetic studies were performed from short-term cultures of dissected chorionic villi and/or sac. RESULT(S): Chromosomal aberrations were found in 75.0% of abortuses in Group I and 65.6% in Group II. Different types of chromosomal abnormalities were present in each these groups. The maternal age-related trisomies which can progress to term (i.e., 13, 18, 21) were associated with early TVUS detection of FHM. The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities varied significantly with maternal age, with normal fetal karyotypes in 7 of 11 (63.6%) women < 35 years, but only in 9 of 41 (22.0%) women > or = 35 years despite the detection of FHM in 24 of 41 (58.5%) of these older women. Detection of FHM was associated with pregnancies continuing beyond the first trimester in 284 of 316 (90.0%) overall, but differed significantly with age (166 of 174 [95.4%] women < 35 years vs. 118 of 142 [83.1%] women > or = 35 years). CONCLUSION(S): Although the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities in spontaneous demises did not differ according to TVUS detection of FHM, the types of aberrations were distributed differently. Since maternal age remains a significant factor in early fetal loss, TVUS detection of FHM should not be as reassuring for women > or = 35 years as for younger women.

Examiner, patient, measuring equipment and ultrasound-based diagnosis form the ultrasound diagnostic system which is characterised by a multitude of internal and external relations. By extending the scope of the system, quality assurance of the ultrasound diagnostic procedures is improved with regard to the physical performance of the system. The performance standards should be established internationally.
