TI  - Ecological and evolutionary physiology of heat shock proteins and the stress response in Drosophila: complementary insights from genetic engineering and natural variation.  
AB  - Classical adaptational and genetic engineering approaches offer complementary insights to understanding biological variation: the former elucidates the origins, magnitude and ecological context of natural variation, while the latter establishes which genes can underlie natural variation. Studies of the stress or heat shock response in Drosophila illustrate this point. At the cellular level, heat shock proteins (Hsps) function as molecular chaperones, minimizing aggregation of peptides in non-native conformations. To understand the adaptive significance of Hsps, we have characterized thermal stress that Drosophila experience in nature, which can be substantial. We used these findings to design ecologically relevant experiments with engineered Drosophila strains generated by unequal site-specific homologous recombination; these strains differ in hsp70 copy number but share sites of transgene integration. hsp70 copy number markedly affects Hsp70 levels in intact Drosophila, and strains with extra hsp70 copies exhibit corresponding differences in inducible thermotolerance and reactivation of a key enzyme after thermal stress. Elevated Hsp70 levels, however, are not without penalty; these levels retard growth and increase mortality. Transgenic variation in hsp70 copy number has counterparts in nature: isofemale lines from nature vary significantly in Hsp70 expression, and this variation is also correlated with both inducible thermotolerance and mortality in the absence of stress.

TI  - Activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and content of indolamines in discrete brain regions after a long-term hypoxic exposure in the rat.  
AB  - The influence of long-term hypoxia (10% O2, 14 days) on in vivo activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration in discrete brain regions of rats was assessed. The activity of tryptophan hydroxylase was determined through 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation (5-HTPacc) following the administration of NSD 1015. The 5-HTPacc was significantly decreased in the dorsal and median raphe (56 and 42%, respectively) and in the striatum (62%). Both 5-HTPacc and the ratio of the concentrations of 5-HIAA to 5-HT were decreased in the nucleus raphe magnus (46 and 27%, respectively), the dorsomedian medulla oblongata (52 and 51%), the locus coeruleus (62 and 40%) and the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (30 and 50%). In contrast, 5-HTPacc was increased in the ventrolateral medulla oblongata (55%) and the preoptic area (83%), but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was lower in these two regions. Finally, 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was also decreased in the periventricular nucleus and in the frontal cortex. Since various patterns of variations in 5-HTPacc and in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were observed, the factors affecting serotonin metabolism in hypoxic rats can be different among brain regions. These results show that, in the rat, long-term hypoxia induces changes in in vivo activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and in 5-HT and 5-HIAA content of some brain structures; some of these biochemical changes may be linked to adaptative mechanisms.

TI  - Comparison of serum antibiotic levels in acne patients receiving the standard or a modified release formulation of minocycline hydrochloride.  
AB  - Serum levels of minocycline hydrochloride were determined by bioassay in a total of 223 acne patients (123 male, 100 female) receiving either the recommended dose (100mg/day) or a high dose (200mg/day) of the standard preparation (101 patients) of a modified release formulation (132 patients). Sera were collected within 6 h of the morning dose 7-10 days after the start of treatment. Mean minocycline serum levels were consistently higher in females than in males, irrespective of dose or formulation. The differences only reached statistical significance (P < 0.05, Student's t-test) in the case of the standard preparation at a dose of 50 mg, b.d. Serum levels were increased significantly in both sexes at the higher dosage of each formulation (P < 0.01) but there was no significant difference between formulations at either dosage.  Variation in serum concentrations was not accounted for by variation in body mass. Serum levels above the modal minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline for fully sensitive strains of Propionibacterium acnes I (0.125 micrograms/mL) were recorded in all patients. In contrast, serum levels equal to or greater than the modal MIC of minocycline for resistant propionibacteria (2 micrograms/mL) were recorded in only 17.9% of patients on the low dose standard preparation compared with 55.6% on the high dose standard preparation (P < 0.001, chi 2). Even in females on the high-dose modified release formulation, 32.2% had serum levels below the modal MIC of minocycline for resistant strains. We conclude that, in terms of achievable serum levels over a short time period, there is no advantage of the modified release formulation over the standard preparation of minocycline. Whichever formulation is used, dose manipulation may be necessary to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit, especially in those individuals who are colonized by propionibacteria with reduced sensitivity to minocycline.

TI  - A review of school vision screening in Glasgow.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess to what extent the primary school vision screening programme was being carried out in the years 1993-94 and 1994-95, what the prevalence of eye defects was in the primary schools and how many children had a positive screening test. DESIGN: Summary sheets of the results of screening were returned by each school nurse. SETTING: All 315 mainstream primary schools served by Greater Glasgow Health Board. SUBJECTS: All school nurses working in these schools. RESULTS: Large numbers of tests were being performed but the screening programme was not fully carried out in 10% of schools in 1993-94 and in 68% in 1994-95, although the number of schools where some screening was performed did increase. The years were not directly comparable due to a change in the age groups screened. When a class was screened 94-96% of children were tested. The rate of positive screening varied from 4% to 15.6% and varied with age and locality. Fewer abnormalities were found at five years than in the older age groups (Primary 1-7.6%, Primary 4-11.4%, and Primary 7-9.7%) and fewer abnormalities were detected in the North-West area where a pre-school orthoptic screening programme was operating (4% in the North-West compared with 11% in the South where no pre-school screening was carried out). CONCLUSION: If the recommended programme is carried out, then 95% of children at age five years could be tested at a stage when amblyopia is still potentially treatable. The reasons for the programme not being completed require to be addressed.  Variations between areas need to be confirmed and the reasons for them identified. Further evaluation of the programme is required, exploring the accuracy of it and the long-term outcomes.

TI  - Dependency of cortisol suppression on the administration time of inhaled corticosteroids [published erratum appears in J Clin Pharmacol 1997 Nov;37(11):1000]  
AB  - Endogenous cortisol suppression is one of the major systemic side effects of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma. A previously developed pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic approach was used to evaluate the influence of administration time on the cumulative cortisol suppression (CCS) after single doses of the inhaled corticosteroids flunisolide and fluticasone propionate. Administration time-dependent simulations of CCS were performed with drug-specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from previous clinical trials. Both drugs showed similar diurnal variation in CCS, dependent on the administration time, with maximum suppression when administered in the early morning at approximately 3 AM. The optimum administration time for minimized CCS was in the afternoon but was shifted from 3 PM for fluticasone propionate to later time points around 7 PM for flunisolide, probably because of the shorter terminal elimination half-life of flunisolide. Regarding peak to trough fluctuation, however, CCS after fluticasone propionate showed only half the administration time dependency as after flunisolide. Therefore, the ratio between CCS after flunisolide and after fluticasone propionate also followed administration time-dependent variations. This led to the conclusion that administration time has to be considered as a pivotal influential factor in clinical studies comparing CCS among different inhaled corticosteroids.

TI  - Variability and reliability of air plethysmographic measurements for the evaluation of chronic venous disease [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Air plethysmography (APG) has the potential to help evaluate different treatments for the prevention of recurrence of venous ulcers; however, there are little reported data on the variation and reliability of the different parameters. This study aimed to assess the variation in different APG parameters in patients with chronic venous disease and to evaluate the reliability of APG in test-retest situations. METHOD: Seventeen patients (18 limbs) with chronic venous disease were recruited into this study. Subjects were asked to undergo tests on two occasions, 1 to 6 weeks apart. Three tests were performed at each visit, and three patients had 10 tests performed at one visit. The coefficients of variation were calculated for repeated measurements and test-retest reliability, and the differences between the means of three tests and the 10 tests were also analyzed. RESULTS: The coefficients of variation for the repeated measurements ranged from 7.5% to 27% for the majority of parameters of APG. The differences between the means of three tests and the means of 10 tests were less than 10% in this study. The coefficients of variation of method error were approximately 10% in test-retest measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that evaluations of calf pump function and venous reflux using APG display variations in repeated measurements and in the test-retest measures. The variations found within patients and on retesting patients on different days suggest that APG is very unlikely to be able to detect small changes in the parameters of venous reflux and calf pump function. It is essential to understand the inherent variation of APG measurements when they are used to assess treatments that are designed to improve venous function.

TI  - Comparison of the rotavirus gene 6 from different species by sequence analysis and localization of subgroup-specific epitopes using site-directed mutagenesis.  
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of gene 6 encoding the rotavirus major capsid protein VP6 of EDIM strain (EW) was determined and compared to that of 20 previously reported strains with known subgroup specificities. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences exhibited a high level of sequence conservation (87 to 99.2%). Site-specific mutagenesis experiments were undertaken to localize regions involved in subgroup specificity. Amino acid positions 305, 315, and a region 296-299 (or 301 for equine strain H-2) were identified as contributing to subgroup epitopes. A single amino acid mutation at position 305 or 315 was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of EW VP6 protein from non I/II to subgroup I- or subgroup II-like, respectively. Mutation at these sites may be another important mechanism for subgroup variation, along with gene reassortment. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

TI  -  Circadian variation of skin perfusion in arterial occlusive disease.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many physiological processes are subjected to circadian variation. We tested if circadian changes of skin perfusion can be detected by measuring laser Doppler flux (LDF) in the foot and if such variations are different in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: LDF was recorded hourly during a 24-hour period in 10 healthy subjects and in 19 PAOD patients, 9 presenting with claudication (stage II according to Fontaine, ankle artery pressures (AP) 80 +/- 11 mmHg) and 10 with skin necrosis (stage IV, AP 42 +/- 29 mmHg). RESULTS: Circadian variability of LDF was significantly reduced in stage IV patients compared both with stage II patients and controls (p < 0.01). An increase in LDF could be observed early in the afternoon and, more pronounced, during the night, occurring to the same extent in healthy and PAOD patients in stage II (p < 0.001). In stage IV the increase in LDF was not significant and a decrease was observed in two patients. LDF and local skin temperature were correlated in controls and stage II patients (mean r = 0.69 +/- 0.12 and 0.7 +/- 0.14, respectively), but not in stage IV (mean r = 0.23 +/- 0.18). A further limitation of LDF variability and nocturnal increase was seen in the presence of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Circadian variations of skin blood flow are comparable in controls and patients with claudication but markedly reduced in patients with severe PAOD presenting with ulcers, in whom skin perfusion seems uncoupled from temperature regulation, possibly due to local factors causing continuous arteriolar vasodilation.

TI  - A modification in restriction pattern of the Plasmodium falciparum Pf60 multigene family associated with a specific antigenic variation switch in the Palo Alto line.  
AB  - The wide occurrence of molecular rearrangements associated with expression of specific members within multigene families led us to investigate whether this also happens during antigenic variation of malaria parasites. We have investigated here the Pf60 multigene family restriction patterns of four distinct variants of the Plasmodium falciparum Palo Alto line propagated in Saimiri monkeys. The O and its cloned Oc variant both express the O serotype, while the R variant (derived from O parasites) and the Vc variant (derived from Oc parasites) express distinct serotypes. We show that a specific modification of the restriction pattern could be associated with antigenic switching in this line. The DNA of the variants which expressed the O serotype (O and Oc) had a specific 5.5 kb Hind III/Eco RI restriction fragment which was absent from the R or Vc parasite DNA, whereas both R and Vc DNA presented a 3.5 kb Hind III/Eco RI restriction fragment, which was absent from the O and Oc parasites. These results indicate that both expression and silencing of the O serotype were associated with specific restriction patterns, suggesting that some molecular rearrangement or some modification of the DNA might control expression of the variant surface antigen in malaria parasites.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the effects of alcohol dehydrogenase genotype on alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver disease.  
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assemble and evaluate existing data on the effect of genetic variation in ADH2 and ADH3 on the risk of alcohol dependence, and on the risk of alcoholic liver disease. Calculations of odds ratios and their confidence limits, and tests for heterogeneity of the results from the available studies, have been performed. It is clear that possession of the ADH2-2 allele decreases the risk of alcohol dependence, but it increases the risk of alcoholic liver disease among alcoholics.  ADH3 variation also has significant effects on alcohol dependence, which may be due to linkage to ADH2; the ADH3 effect differs significantly between Asian and European subjects. Therefore ADH genotype has substantial effects on risk of alcohol dependence and alcoholic liver disease, but more work is needed on the generalizability of these findings to non-Asian populations, and on possible mechanisms.

AB  - 1 Objectives of this study were (1) to compare concentrations of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in air of polluted and nonpolluted area of Czech Republic during winter and summer periods and (2) to verify if urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), as supposed practical biological marker, permits the assessment of spacial and temporal variations in environmental PAH exposure. 2 The study population consisted of three groups: (1) a group of 22 physical exercise students who regularly train outside, from the university situated in a polluted town, spending 14 days in winter and 14 days in summer in 'non-polluted' mountains; (2) a control group of 22 residents from the town and (3) a control group of 18 residents from the mountains. 3 The total PAH concentrations (sum of 13 individual PAH) were 19.3 and 104.6 ng/m3 in town and in mountains, respectively, during summer and 86.6 and 261 ng/m3 during winter. 4 Median 1-OHP levels ranged between 0.03 and 0.13 mumol/mol creatinine for controls and between 0.04 and 0.12 mumol/mol creatinine for students. No relationship was found between pyrene levels in air and group means of urinary 1-OHP. Our results show that other factors (probably PAH in food) contribute in masking air pollution influence on urinary 1-OHP levels in subjects non-occupationally exposed to PAH.

TI  - Pressure-flow studies: an evaluation of within-testing reproducibility--validity of the measured parameters.  
AB  - The within-examination variation in selected test parameters in repeated pressure-flow studies was determined in a retrospective study of consecutive pressure-flow examinations in 105 patients. It was further evaluated to see whether there was a systematic change in the measured parameters during retesting. To see if variation and reproducibility were influenced by the procedure of investigation, i.e., transurethral or suprapubic, patients were grouped according to the method employed. Finally, the effect of detrusor instability on the measurements was evaluated. Using the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram, patients were classified as obstructed, equivocal, or unobstructed. The test-retest variations in classification were evaluated. We found a systematic variation in Pdet.Qmax' Pdet.Open' and Qmax during testing, indicating a physiological effect of repeated pressure-flow studies resulting in a less obstructed second voiding. Accordingly, 69% of the patients who shifted group of classification during retesting shifted to a group of lesser obstruction at the second voiding. Still, 88% of patients remained in the same group of classification of bladder outlet obstruction. Within- and between-patient variations and reproducibility of the test results were not influenced by the procedure of investigation, i.e., the transurethral or suprapubic method. However, we found variations suggesting a decrease in urethral resistance and bladder contractility from test to test in the transurethral group, whereas variations suggesting an isolated decrease in bladder contractility were seen in the suprapubic group. Detrusor instability per se does not seem to cause any systematic changes during repeated testing.

TI  - Poverty and mortality among the elderly: measurement of performance in 33 countries 1960-92.  
AB  - This paper analyses the effect of income and education on life expectancy and mortality rates among the elderly in 33 countries for the period 1960-92 and assesses how that relationship has changed over time as a result of technical progress. Our outcome variables are life expectancy at age 60 and the probability of dying between age 60 and age 80 for both males and females. The data are from vital-registration based life tables published by national statistical offices for several years during this period. We estimate regressions with determinants that include GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power), education and time (as a proxy for technical progress). As the available measure of education failed to account for variation in life expectancy or mortality at age 60, our reported analyses focus on a simplified model with only income and time as predictors. The results indicate that, controlling for income, mortality rates among the elderly have declined considerably over the past three decades. We also find that poverty (as measured by low average income levels) explains some of the variation in both life expectancy at age 60 and mortality rates among the elderly across the countries in the sample. The explained amount of variation is more substantial for females than for males. While poverty does adversely affect mortality rates among the elderly (and the strength of this effect is estimated to be increasing over time), technical progress appears far more important in the period following 1960. Predicted female life expectancy (at age 60) in 1960 at the mean income level in 1960 was, for example 18.8 years; income growth to 1992 increased this by an estimated 0.7 years, whereas technical progress increased it by 2.0 years. We then use the estimated regression results to compare country performance on life expectancy of the elderly, controlling for levels of poverty (or income), and to assess how performance has varied over time. High performing countries, on female life expectancy at age 60, for the period around 1990, included Chile (1.0 years longer life expectancy), China (1.7 years longer), France (2.0 years longer), Japan (1.9 years longer), and Switzerland (1.3 years longer). Poorly performing countries included Denmark (1.1 years shorter life expectancy than predicted from income), Hungary (1.4 years shorter), Iceland (1.2 years shorter), Malaysia (1.6 years shorter), and Trinidad and Tobago (3.9 years shorter). Chile and Switzerland registered major improvements in relative performance over this period; Norway, Taiwan and the USA, in contrast showed major declines in performance between 1980 and the early 1990s.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus genotypes and quantitation of serum hepatitis C virus RNA in liver transplant recipients: relationship with severity of histological recurrence and implications in the pathogenesis of HCV infection.  
AB  - The reasons for the wide variation of incidence and severity of recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation are not clear. We have studied liver transplant recipients to assess the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and HCV RNA quantification on HCV recurrence after transplantation. Twenty-two patients received transplants for HCV cirrhosis and were followed up with virological and histological assessments. Mean follow-up was 39 months. HCV genotype was determined with line probe assay (Inno-Lipa). HCV RNA quantity was determined in serum samples by use of polymerase chain reaction nested assay. HCV genotype 1 was detected in 13 patients and other genotypes in 9. Histological recurrence rates were 69% in patients with genotype 1 and 66% in patients with other genotypes. All cases of severe histological injury (chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis) were observed in patients with genotype 1. HCV RNA quantity was significantly higher in patients with genotype 1 (mean, 2.023 x 10(3) copies/mL) than in patients with other genotypes (mean, 27,403 copies/mL). In conclusion, the severity of histological recurrence after liver transplantation for HCV disease was higher in patients infected by HCV genotype 1 than in those infected with other genotypes. The levels of viral replication were higher in patients with HCV genotype 1 than in those with other genotypes.

Using the same connotations, the 120 utterances were categorized by 73 listeners. Most samples were agreed on by 50%-99% of the judges. Most samples of "astonished," "angry," "frightened," and "commanding" were judged as intended, while "pleading" was often confused with "sad," and "content" with "admiring." Acoustic differences between the categories were examined for F0, duration, and sound pressure; spectral features of [aa] were visualized with the self-organizing map of Kohonen.  Most intraspeaker variation of mean F0, FO range, sound pressure, and duration took place during the [aa] segment. Peak sound pressure, mean FO, and spectral energy distribution of [aa] differentiated among "commanding," "angry," "frightened," "naming," and "sad.". Specific intonations of the [aa] segment were encountered for "astonished," "scornful," and "pleading.". The best-conveyed "admiring" samples were distinguished from "content" by spectral cues for a breathy voice quality.

TI  - [Effect of meteorological variations on the emergence of deep venous thrombosis of the leg]  
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have established a significant relationship between metereology variables and the development of vascular disease. We performed a retrospective study to determine relationships between the development of deep vein thrombosis in the lower limb and certain meteorology variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 345 cases of phlebitis in 1995. We studied the distribution of the number of venous thrombosis per day, per month and per season. We compared certain meteorological data (atmospheric pressure, temperature, mean hygrometery) for days with and days without venous thrombosis and the atmospheric variations during the 48 hours prior to venous thrombosis. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship (p < 0.004) between the mean number of cases of phlebitis recorded per day and season with winter predominating. On days when phlebitis occurred, the atmospheric pressure was significantly lower (p < 0.05). The number of thrombotic events was significantly different on days when the variation was greater than 10 hectopascals than on days when the variation was less than 10 hectopascals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, deep vein thrombosis of the lower limb was significantly associated with certain meteorology variables. Prospective multicentric studies are needed to confirm these relationships.

TI  - ["Bone markers"--when can they be useful? (see comments)]  
AB  - There is an increasing interest in using deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyd) (Pyrilinks-D) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (Alkphase-B) or osteocalcin tests for detecting and monitoring risk persons for osteoporosis. Bone specificity is high, and the possibilities of detecting high bone turnover and fast bone losers in postmenopausal women is good, especially in women between 55 and 65 years of age. The tests are also useful for monitoring therapy, evaluating drug effectiveness and detecting poor compliance. The deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyd)-test must show a repeated high value prior to treatment (2 to 3 times over a period of one month), to allow for day to day variations. Because of the day to day variations in women's estrogen production (perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women), false low values may also be encountered. The use of "bone markers" to detect and treat fast bone losers could probably lead to considerable savings in the health budget and improvement in the quality of life for women worldwide.

TI  - Interlaboratory and intralaboratory variabilities in the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) Program.  
AB  - The Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) Program evaluates over 400 laboratories that perform lead measurements in paints, soils, and dusts. A previous National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study, based on the ELPAT data over a 3-year period (1992-1995), found no large biases among common hotplate and microwave digestion techniques, but did detect small consistent bias between two common instrumental methods. This study expands on the earlier study by examining the total sample variability and its variation components (interlaboratory and intralaboratory). A correlation model was used to separate the variation components by estimating a variation ratio. The correlation model leads to a more general approach than a sample pairing technique developed by Youden. This study found no significant evidence that the relative contribution of intralaboratory and interlaboratory variability to total variability changes with lead loading levels. There were no significant differences in the relative contribution of variation components among three most commonly used analytical methods (combinations of sample preparation techniques and instrumental methods). The interlaboratory relative standard deviation is about 1.7 times the intralaboratory relative standard deviation. Both variation components are important parts of total variation although the laboratory-to-laboratory (including analyst-to-analyst) difference is greater than the within laboratory (including sample-to-sample) variation.

TI  - Changes in serum concentrations of growth hormone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1 and 3 and urinary growth hormone excretion during the menstrual cycle.  
AB  - Few studies exist on the physiological changes in the concentrations of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) within the menstrual cycle, and some controversy remains. We therefore decided to study the impact of endogenous sex steroids on the GH-IGF-IGFBP axis during the ovulatory menstrual cycle in 10 healthy women (aged 18-40 years). Blood sampling and urinary collection was performed every morning at 0800 h for 32 consecutive days. Every second day the subjects were fasted overnight before blood sampling. Follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), oestradiol, progesterone, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, sex hormone-binding globulin, dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate and GH were determined in all samples, whereas insulin and IGFBP-1 were determined in fasted samples only. Serum IGF-I concentrations showed some fluctuation during the menstrual cycle, with significantly higher values in the luteal phase compared to the proliferative phase (P < 0.001). Mean individual variation in IGF-I concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle was 13.2% (SD 4.3; range 0.1-18.3%). There were no cyclic changes in IGFBP-3 serum concentrations and no differences in IGFBP-3 concentrations between the luteal and the proliferative phases.  Mean individual variation in IGFBP-3 concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle was 8.8% (SD 2.7; range 3.2-14.1). IGFBP-1 concentrations were inversely associated with insulin concentrations, and showed a significant pre-ovulatory increase that returned to baseline at the day of the LH surge. Fasting insulin concentrations showed large fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle without any distinct cyclic pattern. No cyclic changes in urinary GH excretion during menstrual cycle were detected. We conclude that, although IGF-I concentrations are dependent on the phase of the menstrual cycle, the variation in IGF-I concentrations throughout the menstrual cycle is relatively small. Therefore, the menstrual cycle does not need to be considered when evaluating IGF-I or IGFBP-3 serum values in women suspected to have GH deficiency.

TI  -  Sequence variation in the Fanconi anemia gene FAA.  
AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive syndrome associated with chromosomal instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy. The gene for FA complementation group A (FAA) recently has been cloned. The cDNA is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 1,455 amino acids, with no homologies to any known protein that might suggest a function for FAA. We have used single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis to screen genomic DNA from a panel of 97 racially and ethnically diverse FA patients from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry for mutations in the FAA gene. A total of 85 variant bands were detected. Forty-five of the variants are probably benign polymorphisms, of which nine are common and can be used for various applications, including mapping studies for other genes in this region of chromosome 16q. Amplification refractory mutation system assays were developed to simplify their detection. Forty variants are likely to be pathogenic mutations. Seventeen of these are microdeletions/microinsertions associated with short direct repeats or homonucleotide tracts, a type of mutation thought to be generated by a mechanism of slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication. A screening of 350 FA probands from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry for two of these deletions (1115-1118del and 3788-3790del) revealed that they are carried on about 2% and 5% of the FA alleles, respectively. 3788-3790del appears in a variety of ethnic groups and is found on at least two different haplotypes. We suggest that FAA is hypermutable, and that slipped-strand mispairing, a mutational mechanism recognized as important for the generation of germ-line and somatic mutations in a variety of cancer-related genes, including p53, APC, RB1, WT1, and BRCA1, may be a major mechanism for FAA mutagenesis.

Limitations are also discussed related to the impact of treatment, clinical application, and dissemination of treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PMT is one of the more well-investigated treatment techniques for children and adolescents. Notwithstanding the large number of controlled studies attesting to its efficacy, fundamental questions remain about the magnitude, scope, and durability of impact.

TI  - Spectral variations of laser-induced tissue emission during in vivo detection of malignancies in the female genital tract.  
AB  - A laser-based fluorescence-guided biopsy system has been developed for the screening and early detection of malignancies in the female inner/outer genital tract. Fluorescence spectra were recorded during in vivo exposure of normal and malignant tissue to He-Cd laser (442 nm) radiation. Spectral distribution of tissue natural fluorescence allowed for the development of simple algorithms, based on spectral intensity variations. A subsequent index of discrimination between normal and various malignant tissues has been calculated. This study focuses on the variability of the experimental data and the possible sources of spectral variations. These results suggest that monitoring of this index during colposcopy could enhance selective detection of the malignant tissue, reducing the risk of leaving pathologic tissue untreated during standard exploratory surgical procedures.

TI  - Mechanisms by which thrombolytic therapy results in nonuniform lysis and residual thrombus after reperfusion.  
AB  - A transport-reaction model describing penetration of plasmin by diffusion and permeation into a dissolving fibrin gel was solved numerically to explore mechanisms that lead to the formation and growth of dissolution fingers through blood clots during thrombolytic therapy. Under conditions of fluid permeation driven by arterial pressures, small random spatial variations in the initial fibrin density within clots (+/-4 to 25% peak variations) were predicted by the simulation to result in dramatic dissolution fingers that grew in time. With in vitro experiments, video microscopy revealed that the shape of the proximal face of a fibrin gel, when deformed by pressure-driven permeation, led to lytic breakthrough in the center of the clot, consistent with model predictions of increased velocities in this region leading to cannulation. Computer simulation of lysis of fibrin retracted by platelets (where more permeable regions are expected in the middle of the clot due to retraction) predicted cannulation of the clot during thrombolysis. This residual, annular thrombus was predicted to lyse more slowly, because radial pressure gradients to drive inner clot permeation were quite small. In conjunction with kinetic models of systemic pharmacodynamics and plasminogen activation biochemistry, a two-dimensional transport-reaction model can facilitate the prediction of the time and causes of clot cannulation, poor reperfusion, and embolism during thrombolysis.

AB  - Three new observations of trisomy 8 mosaicism are presented. In two postnatal cases, both patients showed agenesis of corpus callosum associated with different clinical findings. In a third case, the prenatal diagnosis revealed trisomy 8 mosaicism exclusively in chorionic villi (CV) cells long term culture. Normal results were obtained in CV direct preparation and in cultured amniotic cells. In lymphocytes, the child showed low level trisomy 8 mosaicism. The only clinical findings were deep palmar and plantar furrows. The present cases as well as reports in the literature indicate that the variation in tissular repartition of normal and trisomic clones in trisomy 8 mosaicism is possibly responsible for the missing correlation between cytogenetic findings and clinical severity in this syndrome.

TI  - Tumour necrosis factor alpha promoter gene polymorphism in sarcoidosis.  
AB  - Biallelic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene (TNFA) and in the first intron of the TNF-beta gene (TNFB) have been associated with variation in TNF-alpha production and with susceptibility to severe diseases. Among other functions, TNF-alpha plays a pivotal role in regulatory aspects of granuloma formation and sustenance. In sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology, the clinical course of the disease has been associated with the patient's individual capacity of spontaneous TNF-alpha production by alveolar macrophages. We determined the TNFA and TNFB polymorphisms in 101 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 216 healthy blood donors. A highly significant shift to the more uncommon TNFA2 allele was found in the Lofgren syndrome patient group, which represents the acute form of the disease with frequent spontaneous remission. The results show that gene frequencies of the TNFA gene variation are significantly different within the clinical forms of sarcoidosis, indicating that genetic predisposition for TNF-alpha production may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

AB  - We have used cytochrome oxidase histochemical staining to evaluate whether immature rat lumbar motoneurons show intrinsic separation into high or low oxidative enzyme types. Relative oxidative enzyme levels are frequently used to help differentiate between muscle fibres of various types and to differentiate between mature neurons. Here we show a wide variation in motoneuron cytochrome oxidase levels from prenatal times, although the range of staining levels as measured densitometrically is greater for mature than for prenatal animals.  We find variation in cytochrome oxidase levels among motoneurons prior to the formation of mature patterns of connectivity or electrical activity, and conclude therefore that this differentiation is unlikely to have arisen by differential usage and probably arose as a function of cell lineage.

TI  - T-cell receptor variable alpha (TCRAV) polymorphisms in European, Chinese, South American, AfroCaribbean, and Gambian populations.  
AB  - Interactions involving the T-cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are fundamental to the generation of a specific immune response. The study of interpopulation differences in TCR genes may identify those genes which are subject to selection, and also provides useful information for future genetic studies in these populations. In this study we present analysis of five TCRAV polymorphisms, for V5S1, V6S1, V8S1, V17S1, and V21S1 loci in five human populations by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Caucasian, Chinese, Gambian, AfroCaribbean, and South American Indians (Mapuches) showed marked interpopulation variation for both the silent (V5S1, V17S1, and V21S1) and coding (V6S1 and V8S1) polymorphisms. In general the alleles were conserved in the different populations, but new, additional variants were found for V5S1 and V17S1 in Gambians and Caucasians. V6S1 overall showed the highest nucleotide diversity, and V6S1 genotype distributions were skewed away from expected values in Chinese and Mapuches. Analysis of allelic associations showed a general lack of linkage disequilibrium between the loci, which was reflected by the absence of strong population-specific haplotypes.

TI  - Immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin, its free subunits, and metabolites [see comments]  
AB  - Multiple hCG-related molecules are present in pregnancy serum and urine samples. These include non-nicked hCG (the hormone), nicked hCG, hyper- and hypoglycosylated hCG, hCG missing the C-terminal extension, free alpha-subunit, large free alpha-subunit, free beta-subunit, nicked free beta-subunit, and beta-core fragment. Over 100 immunoassays are sold for quantifying hCG-related molecules in serum or urine. Each measures nonnicked hCG and one of seven combinations of the other hCG-related molecules. This is the source of interassay discordance in hCG determinations. Whereas minor variations are noted in different kit results in normal pregnancy samples (more than twofold variation), much larger variations may be found in two immunoassay results in irregular gestations (spontaneous abortion, aneuploidy, preeclampsia, cancers, and trophoblast disease). Care is needed in choosing an immunoassay. What the assay measures may be more important than its cost or speed. This article reviews the structure of hCG and related molecules. It examines the stability and degradation of hCG, and recognition of hCG-related molecules by different types of immunoassay. Also reviewed are new assays for specifically detecting these other hCG-related molecules.

TI  - Stability of motor-unit force thresholds in the decerebrate cat.  
AB  - To further test the hypothesis that some fixed property of motoneurons determines their recruitment order, we quantified the variation in force threshold (FT) for motoneurons recruited in muscle stretch reflexes in the decerebrate cat. Motor axons supplying the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle were penetrated with micropipettes and physiological properties of the motoneuron and its muscle fibers, i.e., the motor unit, were measured. FT, defined as the amount of MG force produced when the isolated motor unit was recruited, was measured from 20 to 93 consecutive stretch trials for 29 motor units. Trials were selected for limited variation in base force and rate of rise of force, which have been shown to covary with FT, and in peak stretch force, which gives some index of motor-pool excitability. Under these restricted conditions, large variation in FT would have been inconsistent with the hypothesis. Analysis of the variation in FT employed the coefficient of variation (CV), because of the tendency for FT variance and mean to increase together. We found that CV was distributed with a median value of 10% and with only 2 of 29 units exceeding 36%. Some of this variation was associated with measurement error and with intertrial fluctuations in base, peak, and the rate of change of muscle force. CV was not significantly correlated with motor-unit axonal conduction velocity, contraction time, or force. In three cases FT was measured simultaneously from two motor units in the same stretch trials. Changes in recruitment order were rarely observed (5 of 121 stretch trials), even when FT ranges for units in a pair overlapped. We suggest that the large variation in recruitment threshold observed in some earlier studies resulted not from wide variation in the recruitment ranking of motoneurons within one muscle, but rather from variation in the relative activity of different pools of motoneurons. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment order is determined by some fixed property of alpha-motoneurons and/or by some unvarying combination of presynaptic inputs that fluctuate in parallel.

TI  - A glimpse into crabworld.  
AB  - Almost all known arthropod compound eyes exhibit regional variations of resolving power, absolute light, spectral and polarisation sensitivity which are likely to be matched to the probability of significant events and the availability of cues in the visual world. To understand the signal processing requirements that have led to the evolution of matched sensory and neural filters, we thus need a detailed description of the input signals to a visual system and of the tasks to be performed under natural operating conditions. We report here on the first steps we took in an attempt to reconstruct an animal's specific visual world with emphasis on the motion domain. Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) live in burrows on sand- and mudflats and are active during low tide. They carry their eyes on long, vertically oriented stalks and use vision to detect predators and conspecific signals generated by males waving one massively enlarged claw. The crabs sit on the ground plane of a flat world, where significant events are most likely to occur in a narrow band around the horizon. We recorded scenes in a crab colony with a video camera at crab eye height. The salience of relevant features in the spatial, spectral and polarisation domains was analysed in digitised video images and short sequences of film were processed by a two-dimensional network of motion detectors at various spatial scales. The output of the network provides us with histograms of the direction and strength of motion signals in various spatio-temporal frequency bands. We discuss our results in terms of detection problems, predictability of events, global vs local information content and higher level motion processing involved in intraspecific communication.

AB  - The present study measured the normal blink rate (BR) variations in relation to behavioral tasks in 150 healthy volunteers (70 males and 80 females; aged 35.9 +/- 17.9 years, range 5-87 years). The subjects were videotaped in a standard setting while performing three different tasks: resting quietly, reading a short passage, talking freely. The mean BR was computed during each task; the data were compared by means of analysis of variance and Student's t tests. Mean BR at rest was 17 blinks/min, during conversation it increased to 26, and it was as low as 4.5 while reading. As compared with rest, BR decreased by -55.08% while reading (p < 1 x 10(-15)) and increased by 99.70% during conversation (p < 1 x 10(-9)). As compared with reading, BR increased during conversation by 577.8% (p < 1 x 10(-17). The distribution curves were highly reproducible in each task. The best curve fit was represented by a log-normal distribution, with the upper tail of each curve having a normal distribution. Eye color and eyeglass wearing did not influence BR. Women had higher BR than men just while reading. No age-related differences were found. The most common BR pattern was conversation > rest > reading, which occurred in 101 subjects (67.3%); 34 subjects (22.7%) had the pattern rest > conversation > reading; 12 (8.0%) had the pattern conversation > reading > rest. This study identified three normal behavioral BR patterns and showed that BR is more influenced by cognitive processes than by age, eye color, or local factors. The present findings provide a normal reference for the analysis of BR in movement disorders such as dystonia or tics.

Polyclonal antibodies raised against whole venom and against the alpha-type (toxin IV-5 or Ts IV) and the beta-type toxin (toxin gamma or Ts VII) were used to study specific variations in the venom. The ELISA results indicated clear differences among the scorpion venoms examined. The lethality (LD50) determined by subcutaneous injections of pooled venom with the same characteristics showed an interesting correlation between the expression level of each component studied and the lethal effect of the venom. Among the groups analysed, the group with the highest concentration of alpha-type toxin showed the highest toxicity. The groups with the lowest level of toxicity were those with a low concentration of alpha-type toxin. The results show that the lethality of the venom varies from specimen to specimen and suggest that alpha-type toxin must be the major lethal component in the whole venom.

TI  - Cross-cultural patterns of growth and nutritional status of breast-fed infants.  
AB  - Growth patterns and iron status of infants who were breast-fed throughout their first year of life were examined in four populations: 1) a group of high socioeconomic status in California (the DARLING Study), 2) infants of normal birth weight (NBW) but from low-income families in Honduras, 3) low-birth-weight (LBW), full-term infants in Honduras, and 4) infants in Ghana. z Scores were calculated by using both the current National Center for Health Statistics reference data and a pooled data set based on breast-fed infants in six industrialized countries. The NBW infants in Honduras showed rapid growth in the first few months and were similar in weight-for-age to the DARLING infants until approximately 9 mo. By contrast, the LBW infants remained far below the other cohorts throughout the first 12 mo, despite an initial period of catch-up growth. In the Ghanaian infants, weight-for-age faltered beginning at 3-4 mo, but length-for-age did not falter until after 9 mo. Weight-for-length was highest in the NBW Honduran infants and lowest in the Ghanaian infants. When z scores were adjusted for birth weight and maternal height, no significant faltering was evident in either weight or length in any of the cohorts during the first 12 mo. Thus, when breast-feeding is continued during the first year of life and efforts are made to ensure adequate complementary feeding after 6 mo, if growth faltering occurs it is probably attributable to prenatal factors and maternal stature. Population differences in iron status reflected variation in birth weight and in the use of iron-rich foods. Therefore, efforts to prevent child stunting and malnutrition must pay attention to prenatal as well as postnatal factors.

TI  -  Phenotypic variation in transgenic tobacco expressing mutated geminivirus movement/pathogenicity (BC1) proteins.  
AB  - Tobacco plants were transformed with the movement protein (pathogenicity) gene (BC1) from tomato mottle geminivirus (TMoV), using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Different transgenic tobacco lines that expressed high levels of the BC1 protein had phenotypes ranging from plants with severe stunting and leaf mottling (resembling geminivirus symptoms) to plants with no visible symptoms. The sequence data for the BC1 transgene from the transgenic plants with the different phenotypes indicated an association of spontaneously mutated forms of the BC1 gene in the transformed tobacco with phenotype variations. One mutated transgene associated with an asymptomatic phenotype had a major deletion at the C terminus of 119 amino acid residues with a recombination resulting in the addition of 26 amino acid residues of unidentified origin. This asymptomatic, mutated BC1 attenuated the phenotypic expression of the symptomatic BC1 in a tobacco line containing both copies of the BC1 gene. Another mutated form of the BC1 gene amplified from an asymptomatic, multicopy transgenic tobacco plant did not induce symptoms when transiently expressed in tobacco via a virus vector. The symptom attenuation in the transgenic tobacco by the asymptomatic BC1 may involve trans-dominant negative interference.

Milk was sampled individually for urea analyses during pretreatment and during wk 1, 5, 10, and 15 of treatment. Results were compared with N losses estimated from rumen fermentation and with N losses of metabolic origin. The mean milk urea N concentration was 12.6 mg/100 ml of milk (range, 9.0 to 18.3 mg). For bulk samples especially, the rumen efflux of crude protein intake was the main determinant of the variation in milk urea N (r2 = 0.81; residual SD = 1.1). However, N losses from the rumen explained only about 50% of the variation in the milk urea N content of samples from individual cows. The N losses of metabolic origin, which, in these experiments, were responsible for 47 to 100% of urinary N losses, were not related to milk urea N. Results showed that regular measurement of milk urea N in bulk samples can be used to monitor N losses from rumen fermentation. However, the value does not give an indication of the efficiency with which the absorbed protein is utilized.

TI  - Clonal descent and microevolution of Neisseria meningitidis during 30 years of epidemic spread.  
AB  - Serogroup A meningococci of subgroups III, IV-1 and IV-2 are probably descended from a common ancestor that existed in the nineteenth century. The 10.5kb sequences spanning five distinct chromosomal loci, encoding cell-surface antigens, a secreted protease or housekeeping genes and intergenic regions, were almost identical in strains of those subgroups isolated in 1966, 1966 and 1917 respectively. During the subsequent two to three decades, all of these loci varied as a result of mutation, translocation or import of DNA from unrelated neisseriae. Thus, microevolution occurs frequently in naturally transformable bacteria. Many variants were isolated only once or within a single geographical location and disappeared thereafter. Other variants achieved genetic fixation within months or a few years. The speed with which sequence variation is either eliminated or fixed may reflect sequential bottlenecks associated with epidemic spread and contrasts with the results of phylogenetic analyses from bacteria that do not cause epidemics.

TI  - Sex ratio in relation to fathers' occupations.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the sex ratio of children varies between fathers of different occupations. METHODS: The sex ratio (the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls at birth) was calculated in relation to paternal occupation in the cohort of all 253,433 live births in Cumbria, north west England, from 1950-89. Exact binomial confidence intervals were used to estimate whether the sex ratio in each occupational category was significantly different from that for the rest of the cohort. RESULTS: There were fewer occupational categories with significantly different sex ratios at the 5% level than expected by chance alone, assuming the same binomial distribution of sexes at birth within each paternal occupation. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation of the sex ratio with fathers' occupations was not found. There is some evidence that the sex ratio shows less variance than expected under a binomial model which assumes independence of the sex of each child; a possible explanation of this may be parental preference for limiting family size after children of both sexes have been born or some other factor which results in children within a family being more likely to be of both sexes rather than the same sex.

TI  - Nocturnal interactions between community elders and caregivers, as measured by cross-correlation of their motor activity.  
AB  - As the U.S. population ages, families must assume increasing responsibility for the care of elderly members. Disruptive nocturnal behaviors (DNBs) of elders, such as complaining and demanding help, may result in interactions with caregivers that threaten such arrangements. This study aimed to quantify such interactions by cross-correlating motor activity that was simultaneously recorded from the elders and caregivers. Forty-four elder-caregiver pairs reporting DNBs simultaneously kept sleep logs and wore activity recorders for 6 to 8 days. Day and night activity data were analyzed separately, because circadian variations would otherwise have overshadowed the elder-caregiver covariations of interest. An autoregressive model was fitted to each day and night data segment, and the data-model differences were used to calculate a cross-correlation function. Maximum significant values of the cross-correlation functions (rmax) exceeded .300 in 10 pairs of subjects. The unprocessed motor activity of these pairs looked so similar that rmax was interpreted as a measure of the subjects' interactions. The rmax was significantly larger for nighttime activity, especially in pairs who shared the same bed. It was smaller in pairs whose elders had high depression scores and in those with Parkinson's disease or related disorders. It was not affected by the presence of dementia. Analysis of the lags corresponding to significant values of rmax showed that, in cohabiting pairs, it was mainly the elders who initiated interactions. The findings provide unique, objective evidence that the night is a time of special difficulty for many caregivers of older Americans.

TI  - Measures of explained variation for a regression model used in survival analysis.  
AB  - This paper describes a measure of explained variation (MEV) of survival times for a given regression model used in survival analysis. It quantifies the predictive power of a set of prognostic factors in the model, and therefore provides useful information for more precise prediction of patient prognosis, and for designing randomized clinical trials with the capability of determining treatment effects. The MEV defined in this article is asymptotically derived from the squared product-moment correlation; it can be interpreted as an adaptation of the multiple correlation coefficient for the normal linear model to the survival time regression model. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the statistical behavior of the proposed MEV. The MEV is applied to estimate the predictive power of several sets of prognostic factors for gastric cancer in Japan using data from a large clinical trial.

TI  - Effect of social deprivation on disease severity and outcome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social deprivation is now recognised to have an important impact on morbidity and mortality. This study sought to ascertain the effect of deprivation, if any, on disease severity, functional disability, and outcome in rheumatoid patients in Glasgow. METHODS: 814 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were assessed for clinical, functional, and laboratory indices of disease activity. Deprivation categories for individual patients were determined using the Carstairs index. Five year follow up is available for 440 patients. RESULTS: The study population of RA patients live largely in the most deprived areas. Patients from deprived areas have significantly poorer function at outset and at five years as defined by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. This is not attributable to differences in disease duration in patients from the most deprived regions or compliance with treatment. Furthermore, these patients do not achieve over five years the initial functional level of those living in the most advantaged localities. CONCLUSION: RA patients from deprived areas have poorer function, which is associated with greater need--medical, social, and paramedical. Strategies and resources for healthcare need to be adjusted according to this variation.

TI  - Variation of electroencephalographic activity during non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep with phase of circadian melatonin rhythm in humans.  
AB  - 1. The circadian pacemaker regulates the timing, structure and consolidation of human sleep. The extent to which this pacemaker affects electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sleep remains unclear. 2. To investigate this, a total of 1.22 million power spectra were computed from EEGs recorded in seven men (total, 146 sleep episodes; 9 h 20 min each) who participated in a one-month-long protocol in which the sleep-wake cycle was desynchronized from the rhythm of plasma melatonin, which is driven by the circadian pacemaker. 3. In rapid eye movement (REM) sleep a small circadian variation in EEG activity was observed. The nadir of the circadian rhythm of alpha activity (8.25-10.5 Hz) coincided with the end of the interval during which plasma melatonin values were high, i.e. close to the crest of the REM sleep rhythm. 4. In non-REM sleep, variation in EEG activity between 0.25 and 11.5 Hz was primarily dependent on prior sleep time and only slightly affected by circadian phase, such that the lowest values coincided with the phase of melatonin secretion. 5. In the frequency range of sleep spindles, high-amplitude circadian rhythms with opposite phase positions relative to the melatonin rhythm were observed. Low-frequency sleep spindle activity (12.25-13.0 Hz) reached its crest and high-frequency sleep spindle activity (14.25-15.5 Hz) reached its nadir when sleep coincided with the phase of melatonin secretion. 6. These data indicate that the circadian pacemaker induces changes in EEG activity during REM and non-REM sleep. The changes in non-REM sleep EEG spectra are dissimilar from the spectral changes induced by sleep deprivation and exhibit a close temporal association with the melatonin rhythm and the endogenous circadian phase of sleep consolidation.

TI  - Structural modification of fibroblast growth factor-binding heparan sulfate at a determinative stage of neural development.  
AB  - Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans are essential modulators of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activity and appear to act by coupling particular forms of FGF to appropriate FGF receptors. During neural development, one particular HS proteoglycan is able to rapidly switch its potentiating activity from FGF-2, as neural precursor cell proliferation occurs, to FGF-1, as neuronal differentiation occurs. Using various analytical techniques, including chemical and enzymatic cleavage, low pressure chromatography, and strong anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, we have analyzed the different HSs expressed during these crucial developmental stages. There are distinct alterations in patterns of 6-O-sulfation, total chain length, and the number of sulfated domains of the HS from the more mature embryonic brain. These changes correlate with a switch in the ability of the HS to potentiate the actions of FGF-1 in triggering cell differentiation. It thus appears that each HS pool is designed to function in the modulation of an intricate interaction with a specific growth factor and its cognate receptor, and suggests tightly regulated expression of specific, bioactive disaccharide sequences. The data can be used to construct a simple model of controlled variations in HS chain structure which have functional consequences at a crucial stage of neuronal maturation.

TI  - Cryo-electron diffraction as a tool to study local variations in the lipid organization of human stratum corneum.  
AB  - The human skin provides the body with a barrier against transepidermal water loss and the penetration of harmful agents (e.g. microbes) from outside. This barrier function is produced mainly by the outermost, nonviable layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (s.c.). The s.c. consists of terminally differentiated corneocytes surrounded by a continuous intercellular lipid domain, which contains mostly ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids. Small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies have elucidated the lamellar and lateral lipid organizations in these domains. However, these techniques require bulk quantities of SC, as a result of which local structure information on the lipids cannot be obtained. Insights to these local lipid arrangements are important when new transdermal drug delivery systems have to be developed. Therefore, the technique of electron diffraction arose as a tool to study the lateral packing of the lipids in the intercellular domains of SC, locally. In a previous study, the suitability of electron diffraction was demonstrated using a lipid model system that resembled the lipid composition of the SC. The spacings calculated from the electron diffraction patterns were in good agreement with the spacings revealed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The results presented here succeed this previous study. We improved the microscope settings and developed a new preparation method to study ex vivo human s.c. by cryo-electron diffraction. The method is based on the conventional tape-stripping method and offers the possibility to study depth-related changes in the lipid organization of human SC. Diffraction patterns of both hexagonal and orthorhombic lipid lattices have been recorded with spacings that resembled those found in human s.c. by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. After lipid extraction, such diffraction patterns could no longer be detected in the samples.

TI  - Evolution of histone H4 and H3 genes in different ciliate lineages.  
AB  - The histones H4 are known as highly conserved proteins. However, in ciliates a high degree of variation was found compared both to other eukaryotes and between the ciliate species. To date, only H4 histones of species belonging to two distantly related classes have been investigated. In order to obtain more detailed information on histone H4 variation in ciliates we undertook a comprehensive sequence analysis of PCR-amplified internal H4 fragments from 12 species belonging to seven out of the nine currently recognized ciliate classes. In addition, we used PCR primers to amplify longer fragments of H3 and H4 genes including the intergenic region. The encoded amino acid sequences reveal a high number of differences when compared with those of other eukaryotes and the ciliate species investigated. Furthermore, in some species H4 gene variants were detected, which result in amino acid differences. The greatest number of substitutions and insertions found was in the amino terminal region of the H4 histones. However, all sequences possess a conserved region corresponding to those of all other eukaryotic H4 histones. The histone gene variations were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. The tree from our data matches perfectly with the ribosomal RNA data: The heterotrichs, which were considered as a late branching lineage, diverge at the base of the ciliate tree and groups formerly thought to represent ancestral lineages now appear as highly derived ciliates.

TI  - Correlation between cellular radiosensitivity and non-repaired double-strand breaks studied in nine mammalian cell lines.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the relationship between cell killing and non-repaired DNA strand breaks both in repair proficient and deficient cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five of the cell lines used are repair competent (CHO, CHO K1, rat rhabdomyosarcoma R1H, mouse balb and normal human fibroblasts), while four display a reduced repair capacity (scid, xrs1, xrs5, AT). Cell survival was determined by colony formation assay. The total number of strand breaks was measured by the alkaline unwinding technique and the numbers of double-strand breaks by constant-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The nine cell lines showed a broad spectrum in radiosensitivity with SF2 values ranging from 0.018 to 0.58. The cell lines did not vary in the number of induced strand breaks, neither for all strand breaks nor for double-strand breaks alone. In contrast, there was a large variation in the number of non-repaired strand breaks measured 24 h after irradiation. Comparison of cell killing with the number of non-repaired breaks measured after a dose of 90 Gy showed no correlation for single-strand breaks (r2=0.29) but a fairly good correlation for double-strand breaks (r2=0.87). This correlation was found to hold both for repair proficient and deficient cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained strongly suggest that the number of non-repaired double-strand breaks measured 24h after irradiation can be used as an indicator of cellular radiosensitivity.

TI  - Systemic antifungal agents. Drug interactions of clinical significance.  
AB  - There are 3 main classes of systemic antifungals: the polyene macrolides (e.g. amphotericin B), the azoles (e.g. the imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole and the triazoles itraconazole and fluconazole) and the allylamines (e.g. terbinafine). Other systemic antifungals include griseofulvin and flucytosine. Most drug-drug interactions involving systemic antifungals have negative consequences. The interactions of amphotericin B, flucytosine, griseofulvin, terbinafine and azole antifungals can be divided into the following categories: (i) additive dangerous interactions; (ii) modifications of antifungal kinetics by other drugs; and (iii) modifications of the kinetics of other drugs by antifungals. Amphotericin B and flucytosine mainly interact with other agents pharmacodynamically. Clinically important drug interactions with amphotericin B cause nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia and blood dyscrasias. The most important drug interaction of flucytosine occurs with myelotoxic agents. Hypokalaemia can precipitate the long QT syndrome, as well as potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias like torsade de pointes. Synergism is likely to occur when either QT interval-modifying drugs (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole) and drugs that induce hypokalaemia (e.g. amphotericin B) are coadministered. Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes at hepatic and extrahepatic sites are the mechanisms that underlie the most serious pharmacokinetic drug interactions of the azole antifungals. These agents have been shown to notably decrease the catabolism of numerous drugs: histamine H1 receptor antagonists, warfarin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, digoxin, felodipine, lovastatin, midazolam, triazolam, methylprednisolone, glibenclamide (glyburide), phenytoin, rifabutin, ritonavir, saquinavir, nevirapine and nortriptyline. Non-antifungal drugs like carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), phenytoin and rifampicin (rifampin) can induce the metabolism of azole antifungals. The bioavailability of ketoconazole and itraconazole is also reduced by drugs that increase gastric pH, such as H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate and didanosine. Griseofulvin is an enzymatic inducer of coumarin-like drugs and estrogens, whereas terbinafine seems to have a low potential for drug interactions. Despite important advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pharmacokinetic drug interactions during the 1990s, at this time they still remain difficult to predict in terms of magnitude in individual patients. This is because of the large interindividual and intraindividual variations in the catalytic activity of those metabolising enzymes that can either be induced or inhibited by various drugs. Notwithstanding these variations, increasing clinical experience is allowing pharmacokinetic interactions to be used to advantage in order to improve the tolerability of some drugs, as recently exemplified by the use of a fixed combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin.

TI  - Effects of the circadian variation in serum cortisol on markers of bone turnover and calcium homeostasis in normal postmenopausal women.  
AB  - Bone turnover has a circadian pattern, with bone resorption and, to a lesser extent, bone formation increasing at night. Serum cortisol also has a circadian pattern and is a potential candidate for mediating the circadian changes in bone turnover. Thus, we measured bone formation and resorption markers before (study A) and after (study B) elimination of the morning peak of cortisol. We also assessed effects of the circadian cortisol pattern on serum calcium, PTH, and urinary calcium excretion. Ten normal postmenopausal women, aged 63-75 yr (mean, 69 yr), were studied. Metyrapone was administered to block endogenous cortisol synthesis and either a variable (study A) or a constant (study B) infusion of cortisol was given to reproduce and then abolish the morning cortisol peak. Blood was sampled every 2 h for serum cortisol, ionized calcium, PTH, and bone formation markers [osteocalcin and carboxyl-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP)], and timed 4-h urine samples were collected for measurement of calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and bone resorption markers (N-telopeptide of type I collagen and free deoxypyridinoline). During study A, serum osteocalcin had a circadian pattern, with a peak at 0400 h and a nadir at 1400 h. During study B, however, the afternoon nadir of serum osteocalcin was eliminated (P < 0.001 and P < 0.005 for the difference in the patterns of peak and nadir, respectively, on the 2 study days). In contrast, the circadian patterns of serum PICP and urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen and free deoxypyridinoline were virtually identical during the two studies. Urinary calcium excretion declined after the cortisol peak, without differences between the 2 study days in phosphorus or sodium excretion or in serum PTH. We conclude that the circadian variation in serum cortisol is responsible for the circadian pattern of serum osteocalcin, but not that of PICP or bone resorption markers.  The physiological variation in serum cortisol may also reduce urinary calcium excretion.

AB  - We compared the referral diagnoses of TIAs and minor strokes made by non-specialists with those of two consultant neurologists, in 565 consecutive cerebrovascular clinic patients, of whom 508 (90%) were referred with a diagnosis of any TIA or stroke. In 373 (73%), the neurologists felt the diagnosis of a cerebrovascular event to be correct. Agreement with the vascular syndrome (CVA vs. TIA) was significantly higher for patients with a referral diagnosis of stroke (136/176) (77%) than it was for patients with a referral diagnosis of TIA (200/332) (60%) (difference in proportions 17%, 95% CI 9-25). In 37 patients (7%) the neurologists confirmed the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease but not the specific TIA/stroke diagnosis. Vascular surgeons were more likely to be correct in their referral diagnosis of carotid territory cerebrovascular disease (88% correct) than all other sources combined (63% correct) (difference in proportions 25%, 95% CI 11-39), but there was no significant variation in diagnostic accuracy between other individual groups.

Alternative diagnoses included migraine (3%), epilepsy (1%), hyperventilation (1%), multiple sclerosis (1%) and a case of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but many symptoms (8%) were unclassifiable. A strict comparison of diagnostic accuracy would have required assessment of patients not referred for specialist opinion, to estimate false-negative as well as false-positive diagnoses. However, in this patient group (which reflects current local practice) TIAs and strokes seem overdiagnosed.

TI  - Interstitial fluid flow in tendons or ligaments: a porous medium finite element simulation.  
AB  - The purpose of this study is to describe interstitial fluid flow in axisymmetric soft connective tissue (ligaments or tendons) when they are loaded in tension. Soft hydrated tissue was modelled as a porous medium (using Darcy's Law), and the finite element method was used to solve the resulting equations governing fluid flow. A commercially available computer program (FiDAP) was used to create an axisymmetric model of a biomechanically tested rat ligament. The unknown variables at element nodes were pressure and velocity of the interstitial fluid (Newtonian and incompressible). The effect of variations in fluid viscosity and permeability of the solid matrix was parametrically explored. A transient loading state mimicking a rat ligament mechanical experiment was used in all simulations. The magnitude and distribution of pressure, stream lines, shear (stress) rate, vorticity and velocity showed regular patterns consistent with extension flow. Parametric changes of permeability and viscosity strongly affected fluid flow behaviour. When the radial permeability was 1000 times less than the axial permeability, shear rate and vorticity increased (approximately 5-fold). These effects (especially shear stress and pressure) suggested a strong interaction with the solid matrix. Computed levels of fluid flow suggested a possible load transduction mechanism for cells in the tissue.

TI  - Structural analysis of the Spiroplasma virus, SpV4: implications for evolutionary variation to obtain host diversity among the Microviridae.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spiroplasma virus, SpV4, is a small, non-enveloped virus that infects the helical mollicute Spiroplasma melliferum. SpV4 exhibits several similarities to the Chlamydia phage, Chp1, and the Coliphages alpha 3, phi K, G4 and phi X174. All of these viruses are members of the Microviridae. These viruses have isometric capsids with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, cause lytic infections and are the only icosahedral phages that contain single-stranded circular DNA genomes. The aim of this comparative study on these phages was to understand the role of their capsid proteins during host receptor recognition. RESULTS: The three-dimensional structure of SpV4 was determined to 27 A resolution from images of frozen-hydrated particles. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed 20, approximately 54 A long, 'mushroom-like' protrusions on the surface of the capsid. Each protrusion comprises a trimeric structure that extends radially along the threefold icosahedral axes of the capsid. A 71 amino acid portion of VP1 (the SpV4 capsid protein) was shown, by structural alignment with the atomic structure of the F capsid protein of phi X174, to represent an insertion sequence between the E and F strands of the eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel. Secondary structure prediction of this insertion sequence provided the basis for a probable structural motif, consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel beta sheet connected by small turns. Three such motifs form the rigid stable trimeric structures (mushroom-like protrusions) at the threefold axes, with hydrophobic depressions at their distal surface. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence alignment and structural analysis indicate that distinct genera of the Microviridae might have evolved from a common primordial ancestor, with capsid surface variations, such as the SpV4 protrusions, resulting from gene fusion events that have enabled diverse host ranges. The hydrophobic nature of the cavity at the distal surface of the SpV4 protrusions suggests that this region may function as the receptor-recognition site during host infection.

TI  - Comparison of clinical and morphologic cardiac findings in patients having cardiac transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  
AB  - This article compares intergroup and intragroup clinical and morphologic findings in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), and dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) undergoing cardiac transplantation (CT). Few previous publications have described findings in native hearts explanted at the time of CT. The explanted heart in 92 patients having CT was examined in uniform manner with particular attention to the sizes of the ventricular cavities and the presence of and extent of ventricular scarring. Of the 92 hearts examined, 47 had IC, 35 had IDC, and 10 had dilated HC. Although considerable degrees of intragroup variation occurred, the mean degree of left ventricular dilatation was similar among the patients with IC, IDC, and dilated HC. All patients with IC had left ventricular free wall scarring more extensive than that involving the ventricular septum, but the intragroup variation in the amounts of scarring was considerable. Nine of the 10 patients with dilated HC also had ventricular wall scarring, but it was more extensive in the ventricular septum than in the left ventricular free wall and involvement of the right ventricular wall also was present. Eight (23%) of the 35 IDC patients also had grossly visible ventricular scars but they were small and only 1 of the 8 had coronary narrowing and that was not in the distribution of the scarring. Narrowing of 1 or more epicardial coronary arteries >75% in cross-sectional area by plaque was present in all 47 IC patients, in 8 of the 35 IDC patients (7 had no ventricular scars), and in none of the 10 dilated HC patients. Coronary angiography was the major clinical tool allowing separation of the IC, IDC, and HC patients. Coronary angiography did not detect narrowing in any of the 8 patients with IDC who were found to have coronary narrowing on anatomic study. Thus, among patients with IC, IDC, and dilated HC having CT, distinctive anatomic features allow separation of patients with IC, IDC, and dilated HC, but within each group considerable variation in left ventricular cavity size and extent of ventricular scarring occurs.

TI  - Variation between studies in reported relative risks associated with hypertension: time trends and other explanatory variables.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the variation in reported relative risks of coronary heart disease and stroke associated with hypertension and determined reasons for the interstudy variation. METHODS: Studies published since 1970 were examined that reported the absolute number of events and person-years for men by age and hypertensive status. The data were pooled in Poisson regression models with the coronary heart disease or stroke rate as the dependent variable. Independent variables were hypertensive status, age at entry, age of study, duration of follow-up, diastolic blood pressure cut-off point, and interactions of all these variables with hypertensive status. RESULTS: The reported relative risks associated with hypertension ranged from 1.45 to 2.77 for coronary heart disease and from 1.86 to 5.78 for stroke. Smaller relative risks were found in more recent studies, in studies with long follow-up, and in studies using a lower cut-off point to define hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Part of the interstudy variation in relative risks associated with hypertension can be attributed to differences in duration of follow-up, blood pressure cutoff point, and time at which blood pressure was measured, suggesting declining relative risks over time.

TI  - Conformational investigations on glycosylated threonine-oligopeptides of increasing chain length.  
AB  - Stepwise solution syntheses are described of the homo-oligomers Z-(Thr)n-NHCH3 (n=1-4, I1-4), Z-{[Gal(Ac)4beta]Thr}n-NHCH3(n=1-5, II1-5) and Z-[(Galbeta)Thr]n-NHCH3 (n=1-5, III1-5). Members of the III1-5 series were obtained by de-acetylation of the corresponding oligomers of the II1-5 series. The conformational preferences of the terminally protected homo-peptides of the three series were investigated by FT-IR absorption spectroscopy both in the solid state and in CDCl3 solution, at various concentrations. Proton NMR measurements in CDCl3 and in DMSO-d6 were also carried out and the effect of temperature variation on the chemical shifts of amide protons was determined in DMSO-d6 (range 298-335 K) and in CDCl3 (range 298-320K). CD spectra were recorded in water and in TFE. Solubility problems prevented measurements in CDCl3 solution for Z-(Thr)4-NHCH3 and for the entire III1-5 series. The existence of unordered structures in the carbohydrate-free oligomers and of more or less extended, organized structures in the glycosylated derivatives is indicated by the NMR and IR measurements. The sugar moieties apparently show a structure-inducing effect on the peptide chain.

TI  - Does the efficacy of BCG decline with time since vaccination?  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the protective efficacy of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis decreases with time since vaccination. DESIGN: A quantitative review of all 10 randomized trials of BCG against tuberculosis in purified protein derivative (PPD)-negative individuals, that presented data for discrete periods. For each trial, we derived log rate ratios for the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. We also compared efficacy in the first two years, and the first 10 years, to that in the rest of the trial. RESULTS: There was considerable heterogeneity between trials in the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. In seven efficacy decreased overtime, while in three it increased. Average annual change in efficacy was not related to overall efficacy. Efficacy also varied between trials in the first two years after vaccination, at more than two years after vaccination and in the first ten years after vaccination. However the variation in efficacy between trials more than 10 years after vaccination was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). We therefore calculated that the average efficacy more than 10 years after vaccination was 14% (95% confidence interval -9% to 32%). CONCLUSION: BCG protection can wane with time since vaccination. There is no good evidence that BCG provides protection more than 10 years after vaccination.

TI  -  Variation in the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections and otitis media in an urgent medical care practice.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation among hospitalized medical conditions have been reported previously, but there is little information on variation among physicians for medical conditions that constitute a substantial part of ambulatory care. OBJECTIVE: To measure variation in the diagnosis of 2 common medical conditions, otitis media (OM) and upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in an urgent care practice. DESIGN: Estimate the variation in the incidence of new diagnoses of OM and URIs among 19 physicians working at 2 urgent care clinics between January 1, 1995, and March 31, 1995. Patients are seen in order of arrival, and assignment to each physician is random. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Two urgent care clinics staffed by the same 19 physicians. During the 3-month study period, 21,259 patients were seen at the 2 clinics; of these, 1839 (8.65%) received a diagnosis of first time OM; and 8020 (37.73%), of an URI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of new diagnoses of OM and URI estimated as a proportion of all diagnoses for each individual physician. RESULTS: There was substantial variation between physicians in the diagnosis of OM, ranging from a low of 4.2% to a high of 21.8%. There was less variation in the diagnosis of URI (31.7%-48.4%). Some physicians with a low incidence of OM or URI diagnoses had increased the proportion of diagnoses in the other diagnostic category. For OM the variation was greatest for children younger than age 5 years, but substantial variation was also found in adults. For URIs the variation was more uniform across all age groups. The variation was not explained by type of specialty training or years in medical practice. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation between physicians in their diagnosis of OM and URI in an urgent care setting. This variation has implications for cost of diagnosing and treating these conditions, the training of physicians, and our understanding of the treatment of OM.

TI  - Influence of biological and analytical variation on urine measurements for monitoring exposure to cadmium.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the mean intraindividual biological variation in urinary concentrations of cadmium and retinol binding protein (RBP) in untimed, random urine samples and the influence of creatinine or specific gravity correction on reducing this variation. The relation between biological variation and analytical variation in defining uncertainty in a single measurement and significant differences between successive measurements was explored. METHODS: Repeat measurement study in subjects with either high historical exposure to cadmium but without current exposure, or unexposed volunteers. Standard statistical tools used in clinical laboratory medicine were applied to define intraindividual biological and analytical variation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Both creatinine and specific gravity correction of urinary cadmium measurements in random urine samples seem to reduce the intraindividual variability compared with uncorrected values. With a standard definition, acceptable long term analytical precision for measurements of cadmium and RBP combined with creatinine analyses should be < 9% and < 15% respectively. The mean intraindividual biological variation of cadmium and RBP, expressed as creatinine corrected, was 18% and 40% respectively in the subjects exposed to cadmium. With the analytical precision used, significant differences (p < 0.05) between consecutive measurements for creatinine corrected urinary cadmium and RBP would need to show changes of > 54% and > 110% respectively. The relation between significant differences in consecutive results and differences in the analytical precision of the method used to measure the samples is described.

TI  - Relationship between monoamine oxidase (MAO) A specific activity and proportion of human skin fibroblasts which express the enzyme in culture.  
AB  - Total deficiency of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in affected males of a single, human kindred appears to be associated with mild mental retardation and significant behavioral anomalies. Though total MAO-A deficiency appears to be rare, the extent and significance of individual variation in monoamine oxidase A activity in human populations is unclear. Since MAO-A activity is undetectable in blood cells, most systematic surveys of individual variation MAO-A activity have compared enzyme activity in human fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies. Surprisingly, MAO-A activity in skin fibroblast cultures from unrelated donors ranges over 100-fold. It has been suggested that this extreme variation in fibroblast MAO-A activity between donors reflects individual, genetic variation in the regulation of MAO-A in fibroblasts. I have found from studies with immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry that the proportion of MAO-A+ cells in fibroblast cultures is (a) highly variable between cultures, (b) a reproducible characteristic of each culture and (c) the primary factor responsible for variation in MAO-A specific activity in whole cell, skin fibroblast homogenates. It has been shown previously that MAO-A activity of a skin fibroblast culture is relatively constant with continued passage prior to cellular senescence. Therefore, these new data raise the possibility that MAO-A expression is confined to a functionally distinct subset of human skin fibroblasts.

TI  - Subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.  
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. Subgingival paper point samples were taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). Another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group A) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group B) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. Under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. Low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. There was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group A and group B in morphotypes of the different microflora. The predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus, Stomatococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Neisseria, Veillonella, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Kingella, Porphyromonas and Prevotella species. There was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of Kingella dentrificans isolated from group B sites. However, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (Peptostreptococcus prevotii and Propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (Eubacterium aerofaciens, Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium) was detected. These findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  - Metabolite analysis of [11C]flumazenil in human plasma: assessment as the standardized value for quantitative PET studies.  
AB  - Analysis of carbon-11 labeled metabolites in plasma was carried out during positron emission tomography (PET) studies with a central benzodiazepine receptor ligand [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ) in 24 human subjects (14-76 y.o.) including five normal volunteers and 19 patients with neurological disorders. Arterial plasma samples were obtained at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 min after i.v. injection of the tracer, and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rate of plasma [11C]FMZ degradation was associated with a large individual variation, but no significant difference was found in the degradation of [11C]FMZ either between male and female, young and old, or between normal subjects and patient groups. When the mean fraction of unchanged [11C]FMZ at each time point was used instead of individually measured metabolite data for the arterial input function, as much as a 30% error occurred in the distribution volume of the [11C]FMZ binding in the brain. These results indicate that the mean percentage of unchanged [11C]FMZ fraction in subjects cannot be used as the standardized value, and that the analysis of metabolites in plasma is necessary to determine the exact arterial input function for quantitative PET measurement.

AB  - The haemodynamic effects of variations in the relative duration of the compression and active decompression (4 cm/2 cm) during active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACD-CPR), 30/70, 50/50 and 70/30, were tested in a randomized cross-over design during ventricular fibrillation in seven anaesthetized pigs (17-23 kg) using an automatic hydraulic chest compression-decompression device. Duty cycles of 50/50 and 70/30 gave significantly higher values than 30/70 for mean carotid blood flow (32 and 36 vs. 21 ml min-1, transit time flow probe, cerebral blood flow (30 and 34 vs. 19, radionuclide microspheres), mean aortic pressure (35 and 41 vs. 29 mmHg) and mean right atrial pressure (24 and 33 vs. 16 mmHg). A higher mean aortic, mean right atrial and mean left ventricular pressure for 70/30 were the only significant differences between 50/50 and 70/30. There were no differences in myocardial blood flow (radionuclide microspheres) or coronary perfusion pressure (CPP, aortic-right atrial pressure) between the three different duty cycles. CPP was positive in both the early and late compression period and during the whole decompression period. The expired CO2 was significantly higher with 70/30 than 30/70 during the compression phase of ACD-CPR. Beyond that no significant differences in the expired CO2 levels were observed. In conclusion a reduction of the compression period to 30% during ACD-CPR reduced the cerebral circulation, the mean aortic and right atrial pressures with no effect on the myocardial blood flow of varying the compression-decompression cycle.

TI  - The correlation between surface measurement of head and neck posture and the anatomic position of the upper cervical vertebrae.  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Repeated measurements were made of surface postural angles registering the relative positions of the head and neck in photographs and of angles of the upper cervical vertebrae recorded in lateral cephalometric radiographs in the same subjects. For all registrations, subjects assumed the natural head rest position. OBJECTIVES: To examine the correlation between external measurement of head and neck posture and the anatomic positions of the upper four cervical vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Interpretation of surface cervical posture measurement is confounded by lack of knowledge about the extent of the underlying compensatory adjustments among the upper cervical vertebrae that may accompany variation in head and neck posture. The correlation between surface measurement and postural characteristics of the upper cervical spine has not been reported to date. METHODS: The association between a set of angles describing the anatomic position of the four upper cervical vertebrae on lateral cephalometric radiographs and a surface measurement of head and neck posture, the craniovertebral angle, was studied in 34 young adult women aged between 17.2 and 30.5 years, mean age, 24.5 years. Anatomic positions of the upper four cervical vertebrae were expressed by angles relative to the true vertical or horizontal. Surface angles registering head and neck position for each subject were obtained from photographs recorded on two occasions. RESULTS: No strong correlation could be established between the angles taken from the lateral cephalometric radiographs measuring the extent of upper cervical lordosis, orientation of the atlas, vertebral inclination, or odontoid process tilt and surface angles recording head and neck position. This finding was attributed principally to the much greater positional variability demonstrated within the upper cervical spine when compared with the surface measurements of head and neck position. CONCLUSION: Anatomic alignment of the upper cervical vertebrae cannot be inferred from variation in surface measurement of head and neck posture. This is the case even in those people identified with more extreme head and neck postural tendencies.

TI  - A quality assurance network in Central European countries--radiotherapy infrastructure.  
AB  - A survey of the infrastructure in radiotherapy centres in three Central European countries has been performed as a first step in the development of a quality assurance network. Data concerning radiotherapy equipment, staff and number of patients treated in most of the radiotherapy centres from Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were collected at the beginning of 1994. Equipment data have shown that 35% of 182 treatment units are conventional x-ray units, 35% 60Co units, 19% linear accelerators, 7% 137Cs units and 4% betatrons. About 47% of high energy units are older than 12 years and about 20% older than 21 years. An important number of centres still have no simulator which would constitute an important handicap to carry out adequate radiotherapy. The number of treatment planning systems has also been registered; 44% being PC-based systems with locally developed software.  Large variations are observed in the number of patients treated per year, per high energy unit, but 12/47 centres treat more than 700 patients per year and unit. On the average, staffing seems adequate in numbers though there are wide variations. The main limitation of radiotherapy infrastructure in the Central European countries is the low number of linear accelerators and simulators and the advanced age of therapy units.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) Project of the Adolescent Medicine Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Research Network, a unique collaborative effort to conceive and implement a research design intended to examine HIV pathogenesis, pubertal hormonal variation, and the effects of sexually transmitted disease comorbidity in HIV-infected youth to improve their health care. METHODS: This multidisciplinary team has drawn on basic science and clinical experience to produce a study design with relevant and feasible study aims and testable hypotheses. Particular attention has been paid to centralized training and quality control practices. Standardized measurements include direct and computer interviews, physical examination, laboratory analysis, and medical chart abstraction. The protocol has been approved by local institutional review boards. RESULTS: A highly standardized and quality control monitored protocol has been implemented at 16 sites throughout the United States collecting historical, observational, and laboratory data in a group of HIV-infected adolescents and HIV-negative controls. Preliminary data collected on subjects are consistent with published reports of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the HIV epidemic in sexually active youth, thus supporting the integrity of the protocol development process. The study population is, for the most part, in older adolescence, predominantly minority and female, and with publicly financed or no health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The REACH Project is positioned to address questions about the clinical course, immunologic profile, and viral dynamics in HIV-positive youth, and thus is able to inform drug development and management strategies for this understudied population.

TI  - Age and region-dependent contraction to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in rat and guinea-pig isolated trachea.  
AB  - 1. The influence of age and of region on alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction to (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline was examined in rat (4-136 weeks) and guinea-pig (2-156 weeks) isolated tracheal ring preparations with particular emphasis on the early (up to 12 weeks) maturation phase. 2. In rat tracheal rings, significant regional variation was observed with respect to maximal (-)-adrenaline-induced contraction, such that the greatest activity was seen in ring preparations from the laryngeal end of the trachea. Tracheal rings from the carinal end responded very poorly or were unresponsive to (-)-adrenaline, depending on animal age. These regional differences were seen across the age range. The potencies of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline remained unchanged with respect to animal age, but the maximum contractile tension that developed in response to these agonists increased with increasing animal age in all regions of the trachea. 3. In guinea-pig isolated tracheal tissue, maximum contractile responses (Emax) to (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline remained unchanged with increasing animal age. In addition, there was no evidence for a region-dependence in the responsiveness of tracheal tissue to alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction in this species. 4. In both guinea-pig and rat isolated tracheal tissue, alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction appeared to involve the activation of alpha1-adrenoceptors.

We review geographic variation of breast cancer rates in the United States, and exposure to organochlorines, ionizing and electromagnetic radiation, and passive smoking. Results are inconclusive but do not support a major role of environmental risk factors in the etiology of breast cancer.

AB  - The association between herd size and sero-prevalence of Salmonella was assessed in a random-effects model with herd size, county and date of slaughter as fixed effects. A total of 510,915 meat-juice samples from 14,593 herds located in 13 counties in Denmark was included in the study. A random-effects model was developed from separate models for smaller strata of data from herds with approximately equal sizes. The combined model was analysed and the results reported. Herd size was positively associated with the sero-prevalence of Salmonella enterica, but the size of the association was biologically of little importance, because the within-herd and the between-herd variations were relatively large in comparison. The relative magnitudes of the variance components indicated that factors associated with both the herd level and the pig level could be important in the prediction of seroprevalence of S. enterica.

TI  - Sexual selection related to developmental stability in Drosophila buzzatii.  
AB  - Relationships among developmental stability, sexual selection, and body size were examined in the cactophilic fly Drosophila buzzatii. Developmental stability, as measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of wing length, was positively associated to male's copulatory success in a mass-mating experiment with wild-reared flies. Previous studies showed that body size is positively correlated with mating success and other fitness components in this species, but no phenotypic correlation between wing asymmetry and size was found in the present study. Thus, wing asymmetry does not indicate male quality in terms of phenotypic variation in body size. This study suggests that sexual selection against wing asymmetry may be mediated through unknown factors related to developmental stability rather than body size.

TI  - The Collaborative Hospital Transfusion Study: variations in use of autologous blood account for hospital differences in red cell use during primary hip and knee surgery.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell use in patients undergoing Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) 209 procedures (major joint and limb reconstruction procedures of the lower extremities) has been shown to have large, unexplained interhospital variations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Abstracted records of 2590 consecutive DRG 209 patients at five university hospitals from January 1992 to December 1993 were stratified by procedure and preoperative blood deposit status. Patient characteristics and transfusion and in-hospital outcomes were compared across hospitals. RESULTS: Blood use among patients who did not preoperatively deposit blood was similar across hospitals. Significant differences were found across hospitals for total hip replacement patients in the percentage of patients preoperatively depositing blood (59-80%), percentage of patients receiving transfusion(s) (51 to > 99%), the mean number of units collected per patient (1.6-2.9), and the mean number of unused autologous units per 100 patients (1-185). No significant differences were found in the percentage of those who deposited blood and then required allogeneic units. There was little variability in length of hospital stay or in last hematocrits. Findings were similar for total knee replacement patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital variations in red cell use for primary total hip and knee reconstruction are primarily due to hospital-specific differences in autologous blood collection and transfusion.

TI  - DNA sequence diversity in a 9.7-kb region of the human lipoprotein lipase gene [see comments]  
AB  - Lipoprotein lipase plays a central role in lipid metabolism and the gene that encodes this enzyme (LPL) is a candidate susceptibility gene for cardiovascular disease. Here we report the complete sequence of a fraction of the LPL gene for 71 individuals (142 chromosomes) from three populations that may have different histories affecting the organization of the sequence variation. Eighty-eight sites in this 9.7 kb vary among individuals from these three populations. Of these, 79 were single nucleotide substitutions and 9 sites involved insertion-deletion variations. The average nucleotide diversity across the region was 0.2% (or on average 1 variable site every 500 bp). At 34 of these sites, the variation was found in only one of the populations, reflecting the differing population and mutational histories. If LPL is a typical human gene, the pattern of sequence variation that exists in introns as well as exons, even for the small number of samples considered here, will present challenges for the identification of sites, or combinations of sites, that influence variation in risk of disease in the population at large.

TI  - Holoprosencephaly: from Homer to Hedgehog.  
AB  - Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a common developmental defect affecting the forebrain and face, is etiologically heterogeneous and exhibits wide phenotypic variation. Graded degrees of severity of the brain malformation are also reflected in the highly variable craniofacial malformations associated with HPE. In addition, individuals with microforms of HPE, who usually have normal cognition and normal brain imaging, are at risk for having children with HPE. Some obligate carriers for HPE may not have any phenotypic abnormalities. Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with HPE suggest loci containing genes important for brain development, and abnormalities in these genes may result in HPE. Recently, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) was the first gene identified as causing HPE in humans. Proper function of SHH depends on cholesterol modification. Other candidate genes that may be involved in HPE include components of the SHH pathway, elements involved in cholesterol metabolism, and genes expressed in the developing forebrain.

TI  - Coevolution of immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain variable-region gene families.  
AB  - The gene families encoding the immunoglobulin variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains in vertebrates are composed of many genes. However, the gene number and the extent of diversity among VH and VL gene copies vary with species. To examine the causes of this variation and the evolutionary forces for these multigene families, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of VH and VL genes from the species of amniotes. The results of our analysis showed that for each species, VH and VL genes have the same pattern of clustering in the trees, and, according to this clustering pattern, the species can be divided into two groups. In the first group of species (humans and mice), VH and VL genes were extensively intermingled with genes from other organisms; in the second group of species (chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, swine, and horses), the genes tended to form clusters within the same group of organisms. These results suggest that the VH and VL multigene families have evolved in the same fashion: they have undergone coordinated contraction and expansion of gene repertoires such that each group of organisms is characterized by a certain level of diversity of VH and VL genes. The extent of diversity among copies of VH and VL genes in each species is related to the mechanism of generation of antibody variety. In humans and mice, DNA rearrangement of immunoglobulin variable, diversity, and joining-segment genes is a main source of antibody diversity, whereas in chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, swine, and horses, somatic hypermutation and somatic gene conversion play important roles. The evolutionary pattern of VH and VL multigene families is consistent with the birth-and-death model of evolution, yet different levels of diversifying selection seem to operate in the VH and VL genes of these two groups of species.

TI  - The effect of selective sweeps on the variance of the allele distribution of a linked multiallele locus: hitchhiking of microsatellites.  
AB  -  Microsatellite variation and the mechanisms which are responsible for this variation have received much attention in the last few years. Most theoretical studies of microsatellite allele distributions, however, did not incorporate the evolutionary dynamics of linked sites. The dynamics is usually modeled by invoking a special mutation mechanism such as stepwise mutation, which leads to a stepwise increase or decrease of the number of motif repeats on the occasion of mutation. It is shown here that selection at a locus, which itself is not subject to mutation, but which is adjacent to a microsatellite locus has an influence on statistics of the microsatellite allele distribution, provided that mutation rates are low to intermediate, when compared to 1/t1, the inverse of the time to fixation of a linked favorable substitution. If mutation rates are high, as for example in humans, a selective effect upon the microsatellite locus, such as hitchhiking, will quickly be obscured by mutations. In particular, in the latter case, the model shows that no correlation is to be expected between recombination rates and variability of microsatellites--such as had been predicted and experimentally demonstrated for nucleotide variability and recombination rates in Drosophila. The present model is a generalization of the two locus two allele hitchhiking model which had been studied by Stephan and co-workers.

TI  - Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to define epidemiologically linked and un-linked infections in South Africa.  
AB  - Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of HBV infection. In an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the preS1 gene, that 52 children were infected with HBV strains that displayed only 5 different SSCP profiles. Sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire preS1 gene, revealed that isolates with same SSCP profile were identical in sequence across the entire preS1 gene, confirming that those patients with the same SSCP pattern had epidemiologically linked infections. A second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different hospitals, 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had occurred. Two of these 5 patients had HBV strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these two, while diversity of both SSCP profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common source. The donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these patients. HBV isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of preS1 sequence variation of local HBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference HBV clones revealed that of 27 local HBV strains, genotypes A and D occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients respectively, while genotype C was detected in one patient.

TI  - Involvement of IsK-associated K+ channel in heart rate control of repolarization in a murine engineered model of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.  
AB  - The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome affects the human cardioauditory system, associating a profound bilateral deafness with an abnormally long QT interval on the ECG. It results from mutations in KVLQT1 and ISK genes that encode the 2 subunits forming the K+ channel responsible for the cardiac and inner ear slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs). A JLN mouse model that presents typical inner ear defects has been created by knocking out the isk gene (isk-/-). This study specifically reports on the cardiac phenotype counterpart, determined in the whole animal and at mRNAs and cellular levels. Surface ECG recordings of isk-/- mice showed a longer QT interval at slow heart rates, a paradoxical shorter QT interval at fast heart rates, and an overall exacerbated QT-heart rate adaptation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A 300-ms increase in the heart rate cycle length induces a 309+/-21% increase in the QT duration of the WT mice versus a 500+/-50% in isk-/- mice (P<0.001). It is concluded that the isk gene product and/or IKs, when present, blunts the QT adaptation to heart rate variations and that steeper QT-RR relationships reflect a greater susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients lacking IKs.

AB  - We have investigated the degree of spatial correlation between the cerebral blood flow variations measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and the electromagnetic sources as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in five subjects while performing a self-paced right index finger tapping task. Data were processed independently for each technique using both single-case and intersubject analysis. PET and MEG were coregistered with anatomical magnetic resonance images for each subject. Both extension and flexion motor-related fields were extracted from the MEG signal. Using the single dipole model we identified the motor evoked field 1 (MEF1) in all subjects and the motor field (MF) in three subjects. Individual and intersubject averaged PET data showed consistent contralateral primary sensorimotor (PSM) hand area and bilateral supplementary motor area activation. MEG individual and intersubject averaged results demonstrated that both MEF1 and MF dipoles were localized within the PSM PET activated area. Individual PSM mass center to dipole distance was 12 and 15.3 mm on average for the MEF1 and the MF component, respectively. For the same components, the intersubject averaged analysis shows distances between the PET Z-score maximum and the dipole locations of 6.3 and 15.0 mm, respectively. These results show that PET and MEG MEF1 activation signals spatially coincide within instrumental, registration, and modeling errors.

TI  - Transforming growth factor beta1 in the human endometrium. Cyclic variation, increased expression by estradiol and progesterone, and regulation of plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify cyclic variations and hormonal regulation of endometrial transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) mRNA. Regulation of the plasminogen-activating system was also examined, since it is involved in activation of latent TGFbetas. We measured TGFbeta1 mRNA in 51 normal endometrial samples by Northern blot and densitometric scanning of autoradiograms. Each value was related to the corresponding beta-actin value to allow quantitative evaluation. TGFbeta1 mRNA was higher in the mid and late secretory and menstrual phases than in the earlier parts of the cycle. This pattern implies progesterone dependence. The content of TGFbeta1 mRNA in endometrial tissue explants obtained in the proliferative phase was significantly increased after stimulation for 4 days with estradiol + progesterone in vitro. Both TGFbeta1 and estradiol + progesterone increased the content of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA and protein in primary cultures of endometrial stromal cells. Conditioned-medium concentrations of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) were increased by TGFbeta1, but decreased by estradiol + progesterone. This effect of estradiol + progesterone results from increased internalization and degradation of u-PA secondary to up-regulation of the cell surface receptor for u-PA by progesterone (Casslen et al., JCEM 1995; 80: 2776-2784). Increased extracellular u-PA in response to TGFbeta1 exposure was thus in concordance with an unchanged amount of available u-PA receptors on the cell surface. The activation mechanism of latent TGFbeta involves u-PA activity; since u-PA activity is reduced in the secretory endometrium, we suggest that although TGFbeta1 mRNA is increased in the mid and late secretory phase, TGFbetas are mainly in their latent form until the premenstrual rise in u-PA activity stimulates activation. TGFbeta may promote capillary growth during endometrial regeneration.

TI  - Muscle spindles are concentrated in the superior vocalis subcompartment of the human thyroarytenoid muscle.  
AB  - It is hypothesized that different parts of the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) are functionally specialized. Specifically, the TA is divided into a lateral muscularis compartment and a medial vocalis compartment. This study examined the distribution of muscle spindles throughout the human TA as an indicator of these functional differences. Histological cross-sections from the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of five human membranous vocal folds were examined for the number and location of muscle spindles. There was an average of 6.1 muscle spindles in sections from each region with no significant variation between the different regions (p < .05). However, in sections from all three regions, the muscle spindles were always found to be concentrated in the superior medial quadrant of the TA (mean 85.9%, p < .01). The inferior medial, superior lateral, and inferior lateral quadrants of the TA contained 11.96%, 2.17%, and 0%, respectively, of the total muscle spindles. Within the superior medial quadrant, most of the muscle spindles were localized in the most superficial part of the muscle. The results of this study demonstrate that the majority of TA muscle spindles are concentrated in its superior medial quadrant, an area we have termed the superior vocalis subcompartment (SC). This finding suggests that the superior vocalis SC is functionally distinct from the remainder of the TA. It is hypothesized that tension in the superior vocalis SC can be controlled independently from the remainder of the TA, and this capability is used to effect the biomechanics of vocal fold vibration during phonation.

AB  - In an attempt to differentiate between Weissella viridescens, W. paramesenteroides, W. hellenica and some atypical arginine-negative Weissella isolates from meats, their cellular fatty acid composition was determined by a rapid GC method. Results showed that W. viridescens synthesized eicosenoic (n-C20:1) acid, while the other two species did not. Meanwhile, unlike W. paramesenteroides, W. hellenica lacked cyclopropane fatty acids with 19 carbon atoms, i.e. dihydrosterculic or lactobacillic acid. Weissella viridescens contained zero to low amounts (< 1%) of C19 cycl. Original meat isolates identified as W. viridescens or W. hellenica shared similar fatty acid profiles with the respective type strains, whereas the "wild" atypical Weissella isolates resembled more with W. paramesenteroides, and all together with Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides.  Interesting variations were noted in the total C19 cycl contents among unidentified Weissella, being generally consistent with their grouping based on the type of lactate they formed and the whole-cell protein profile similarity they shared.

TI  - Clinical performance of glass-ionomers.  
AB  - Glass-ionomers were introduced to the profession 20 years ago and have been shown to be a very useful adjunct to restorative dentistry. Their major advantages include the ion exchange adhesion to both enamel and dentine and a continuing fluoride release throughout the life of the restoration. The chemistry of the setting reaction is essentially an acid/base reaction but recent research has introduced variations in an effort to improve clinical handling. Small additions of resin increase the physical properties to a degree and allow for a light-initiated setting mechanism. However, it is essential that the acid/base reaction remains dominant if the full advantages of the glass-ionomer are to be retained. The material has multiple uses in dentistry and it shows a high degree of biocompatibility to the pulp and surrounding soft tissues. The main limitation at this time is a relatively low fracture resistance but it is possible to protect it through lamination with stronger materials if the need arises. This paper examines the essential parameters for successful clinical placement and comments on its longevity.

TI  - Follicle stimulating hormone international standards and reference preparations for the calibration of immunoassays and bioassays.  
AB  - Follicle stimulating hormone is a dimeric glycoprotein hormone which is used widely in reproductive and developmental medicine both as a diagnostic analyte and as a therapeutic product. It is therefore a good example of a clinically important heterogeneous material for which a number of different assay methodologies have been developed. Immunoassays for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are used in the diagnosis of disorders of reproduction and development, whereas in vivo bioassays are used for calibration of therapeutic preparations. Different immunoassay systems, based on different formats, exhibit variability in their estimates of activity of FSH which arises from different specificities of antibodies for different forms of FSH which are encountered. In order to minimise between assay variation and to enable better between laboratory comparisons the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a series of ampouled preparations of FSH. The availability of these materials has been reviewed previously but on the completion of a recent collaborative study to evaluate candidate standards for rDNA-derived FSH and highly purified urinary FSH (urofollitropin) it is now appropriate to review the current status of these standards and to discuss the future of standardisation for FSH in particular and where appropriate to make reference to other materials.

TI  - Influence of pH on metabolism and urease activity of Helicobacter pylori.  
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The metabolic and urease responses of Helicobacter pylori to variations in gastric acidity are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine effects of changes of environmental pH on metabolism, urease activity, and survival of H. pylori in an unbuffered environment. METHODS: Bacterial metabolism and urease activity were determined by measuring pH changes in perfused microphysiometer chambers over a pH range from 2.5 to 9.0 with or without urea and survival by restoration of metabolism at pH 7.4. RESULTS: Glucose metabolism by acid-adapted H. pylori occurred at a perfusion pH between 3.5 and 8.6 and was highest between 7.4 and 8.2. Metabolism was irreversibly inhibited at pH <3.5 or >8.6. In the presence of 2.5 mmol/L urea, the chamber pH increased to about 6.2 during perfusion between pH 5.5 and 4.0. At pH 4.0 and below, urease activity increased several-fold without change of chamber pH. Urea in the perfusate enabled retention of metabolism after acid exposure but was toxic at pH 7.4. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic range of acid-adapted H. pylori is between an environmental pH of 3.5 and 8.6. Extracellular pH-regulated internal urease activity allows metabolism in the pH range between 4.0 and 2. 5 by maintaining periplasmic pH at 6.2. The organism is an acid-tolerant neutralophile due to internal urease activity.

TI  - Short-term growth: evidence for chaotic series of mini growth spurts in rat growth.  
AB  - Five thousand and eighteen quadruplet daily measurements of lower-leg length of 62 female and 81 male rats, were performed in order to characterize short-term growth. Within a short time, growth proceeds irregularly and consists of multiple incremental bursts (mini growth spurts) with no evidence for strict periodic behavior. Mini growth spurts are S-shaped incremental patterns that can be characterized by double-exponential functions (Gompertz's functions). Gompertz's functions are S-shaped, and can be defined by three parameters that identify amplitude, inflection point (age at peak growth velocity), and slope. The latter not only refers to the rapidity of each incremental burst, but also alludes to the duration that one incremental burst needs for completion. In regard to these characteristics, mini growth spurts differ significantly between the sexes in rats. Mean amplitude of mini growth spurts was 2153 microm (SD 1034 microm) in female rats and 2958 microm (SD 1614 microm) in male rats. Peak growth velocity of mini growth spurts appeared lower in male rats than in female rats. Female rats showed mean gamma of -1.23 (SD 0.72), whereas male rats showed mean y of -0.96 (SD 0.72). Partial growth hormone deficiency led to a modification in rats that was reversed when exogenous growth hormone was administered. Mean intervals between subsequent mini growth spurts ranged between 4.2 and 4.6 days, but the large variation of these intervals (SD between 1.6 and 2.3 days) and the fact that neither spurt-spurt interval nor spurt amplitude appeared predictable, strongly suggest chaotic behavior of mini growth spurts.

In normal adult brain, microglial cells are in a resting state, but they become activated during inflammation of the central nervous system, after neuronal injury, and in several neurological diseases. Patch-clamp studies of microglial cells in cell culture and in tissue slices demonstrate that microglia express a wide variety of ion channels. Six different types of K+ channels have been identified in microglia, namely, inward rectifier, delayed rectifier, HERG-like, G protein-activated, as well as voltage-dependent and voltage-independent Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Moreover, microglia express H+ channels, Na+ channels, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ channels, and voltage-dependent and voltage-independent Cl- channels. With respect to their kinetic and pharmacological properties, most microglial ion channels closely resemble ion channels characterized in other macrophage preparations. Expression patterns of ion channels in microglia depend on the functional state of the cells. Microglial ion channels can be modulated by exposure to lipopolysaccharide or various cytokines, by activation of protein kinase C or G proteins, by factors released from astrocytes, by changes in the concentration of internal free Ca2+, and by variations of the internal or external pH. There is evidence suggesting that ion channels in microglia are involved in maintaining the membrane potential and are also involved in proliferation, ramification, and the respiratory burst. Further possible functional roles of microglial ion channels are discussed.

TI  - Swellable microparticles containing Suprofen: evaluation of in vitro release and photochemical behaviour.  
AB  - Suprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug was incorporated in polymer networks based on biocompatible macromolecules, such as alpha,beta-polyasparthydrazide (PAHy) and alpha,beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide (PHEA) crosslinked by glutaraldehyde or gamma-rays, respectively. Swelling tests carried out in aqueous media showed that pH value affects the swelling degree of the prepared hydrogels. In vitro release tests were performed in simulated gastrointestinal fluids (pH 1/6.8) using the pH variation method and in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Experimental data indicated that Suprofen was released in a sustained way both from PAHy and PHEA microparticles. Further, incorporation of Suprofen in PAHy and PHEA networks provided a significant reduction of the drug photosensitizing activity, as evidenced by in vitro hemolysis tests.

TI  - The kinetics of tracer movement through homologous gap junctions in the rabbit retina.  
AB  - Observation of the spread of biotinylated or fluorescent tracers following injection into a single cell has become one of the most common methods of demonstrating the presence of gap junctions. Nevertheless, many of the fundamental features of tracer movement through gap junctions are still poorly understood. These include the relative roles of diffusion and iontophoretic current, and under what conditions the size of the stained mosaic will increase, asymptote, or decline. Additionally, the effect of variations in amount of tracer introduced, as produced by variation in electrode resistance following cell penetration, is not obvious. To examine these questions, Neurobiotin was microinjected into the two types of horizontal cell of the rabbit retina and visualized with streptavidin-Cy3. Images were digitally captured using a confocal microscope. The spatial distribution of Neurobiotin across the patches of coupled cells was measured. Adequate fits to the data were obtained by fitting to a model with terms for diffusion and amount of tracer injected. Results indicated that passive diffusion is the major source of tracer movement through gap junctions, whereas iontophoretic current played no role over the range tested. Fluorescent visualization, although slightly less sensitive than peroxidase reactions, produced staining intensities with a more useful dynamic range. The rate constants for movement of Neurobiotin between A-type horizontal cells was about ten times greater than that for B-type horizontal cells. Although direct extrapolation to ion conductances cannot be assumed, tracer movement can be used to give an estimate of relative coupling rates across cell types, retinal location, or modulation conditions in intact tissue.

TI  - Topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves in the subarachnoid space and internal auditory canal.  
AB  - PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate the topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves from the brain stem through the internal auditory canal. METHODS: We dissected 15 formalin-fixed cadaveric heads and performed MR examinations in 35 healthy subjects in order to examine the topographical relationship of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves. The cadaveric dissections and the in vivo MR imaging findings were compared indirectly. RESULTS: The relationship between the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves showed some variation among individuals and according to the location of the nerves within the cisterns or canal. Near the brain stem, 53% of the vestibulocochlear nerves were partially segmented on MR images. The vestibulocochlear nerve was completely divided into separate nerves only in the most lateral portion of the canal, except in three cadaveric dissections, in which separation of the superior vestibular nerve was seen near the brain stem. The facial and cochlear nerves were of similar size on 36% of the MR images. The superior vestibular nerve was larger than the inferior vestibular nerve on 81% of the MR images. CONCLUSION: The appearance of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves was variable but followed certain consistent patterns.

We conclude that the PCR-SSCP strategy we developed could be advantageously used to fully characterize the extent of allelic variation at the TPMT gene locus in populations and thus to improve our understanding of the genetic polymorphism of TPMT activity, which has considerable consequences for the toxicity and efficacy of therapeutically important and widely used drugs.

TI  - Detection of known and new mutations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.  
AB  - To detect mutations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene (TPMT), we have developed a strategy based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivity of the method was first evaluated by analyzing DNA samples from five individuals, including two high methylators (HMs), two intermediate methylators (IMs), and one deficient methylator (DM). TPMT alleles and mutations in each of these individuals had previously been characterized by conventional PCR-based assays and direct sequencing analysis. All mutations were associated with particular shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments, allowing their identification. We further tested the efficiency of the strategy to detect new TPMT mutations. For this purpose, additional DNAs from 15 IMs and 15 HMs were submitted to PCR-SSCP analysis. A total of 7 alleles were characterized, including two new alleles. The first one, termed TPMT*1A, harbors a single mutation C-->T at nucleotide -178 in exon 1 and was detected in a HM subject. The second one, termed TPMT*7, was characterized by a T-->G transversion at nucleotide 681 in exon 10. This allele should be a nonfunctional allele of the TPMT gene since it was observed in combination with a wild-type allele in an intermediate methylator. We conclude that the PCR-SSCP strategy we developed could be advantageously used to fully characterize the extent of allelic variation at the TPMT gene locus in populations and thus to improve our understanding of the genetic polymorphism of TPMT activity, which has considerable consequences for the toxicity and efficacy of therapeutically important and widely used drugs.

TI  - Minimax optimization-based inverse treatment planning for interstitial thermal therapy.  
AB  - The following work represents the development and evaluation of a minimax optimization-based inverse treatment planning approach for interstitial thermal therapy of cancer and benign disease. The goal is to determine a priori optimal applicator placements and power level settings to maintain the minimum tumour temperature, Tmin, and maximum normal tissue temperature, Tmax within a prescribed therapeutic temperature range. The temperature distribution is approximated by a finite element method (FEM) solution of a bioheat transfer equation on a nonuniform finite element mesh. Lower and upper therapeutic temperature thresholds are specified in the tumour and surrounding normal tissues. A constrained minimax optimization problem is formulated to determine optimal applicator positions and power level settings that minimize the maximum (rather than average) temperature errors in the target tumour region and surrounding normal tissues. The optimization problem is formulated for two general classes of interstitial heating applicators, those with and without a surface cooling mechanism. The viability and sensitivity of this approach is investigated in the two-dimensional setting for various tumour shapes and blood perfusion levels using surface-cooled and direct-coupled interstitial ultrasound applicator power deposition models. These preliminary results indicate the utility of this approach for meeting a prescribed Tmin/Tmax-based clinical objective criterion, and its potential for generating optimal treatment plans that can withstand variations or uncertainty in blood perfusion levels.

TI  - Measurement of lumbar spine flexion-extension using a low-field open-magnet magnetic resonance scanner.  
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors investigated the feasibility of using a low-field open-magnet magnetic resonance (MR) scanner to acquire functional flexion-extension images for range of motion (ROM) measurements on the lumbar spine. METHODS: Seventeen healthy subjects with no symptoms of back pain (age range, 22-59 years) were scanned in a low-field open-magnet MR scanner in the flexed, neutral, and extended positions. Each image was downloaded to a computer workstation for subsequent flexion-extension, lordosis, and ROM measurement. RESULTS: Data from two subjects were not analyzed because their images did not show all the lumbar vertebrae. For the remaining 15, there was a large variation in the magnitude of the ROM values (range, 9 degrees-70 degrees; mean 36.4 degrees, SD 16.5 degrees). However, there was a significant correlation between age and ROM (r = -0.63; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The low-field open-magnet MR scanner provides a method for noninvasive imaging of the lumbar spine, allowing the subject freedom of movement in the horizontal plane. This enables functional flexion-extension images of the lumbar spine to be acquired.

TI  - Schizophrenia: the illness that made us human.  
AB  - Any hypotheses concerning the origins of humans must explain many things. Among these are: 1, the growth in brain size around two million years ago; 2, the presence of subcutaneous fat; 3, the near absence of change or cultural progress for around 2 million years after the brain grew in size; 4, the cultural explosion which began somewhere between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years ago with the emergence of art, music, religion and warfare; 5, the further cultural explosion around ten thousand to fifteen thousand years ago which developed with the emergence of agriculture and which has continued since. Since the brain, like subcutaneous fat, is particularly rich in lipids, and since the microconnections of the brain are substantially lipid in nature, it is suggested that changes in lipid metabolism are what differentiated humans from the great apes. The growth in brain size and in the quality of subcutaneous adipose tissue may have occurred because of changes in the proteins which regulate the rate of delivery of fatty acids to tissues, notably lipoprotein lipases and fatty acid binding proteins. The creativity which occurred one hundred thousand years ago may have resulted from changes in phospholipid-synthesizing, -remodelling and -degrading enzymes which largely determine the microconnectivity of neurons. Family studies and adoption studies indicate that schizophrenia in a family member is associated with an increased risk of the illness in other family members. It is also associated with an increased risk of schizotypy, manic-depression, dyslexia, sociopathy and psychopathy. On the other hand it is also an indication of an increased likelihood of high creativity, leadership qualities, achievements in many fields, high musical skills and an intense interest in religion. I propose that the characteristics which entered the human race about one hundred thousand years ago and which ended around two million years of cultural near-stagnation are precisely those shown by the families of people with schizophrenia. I propose that these features are caused by variations in phospholipid biochemistry which are responsible both for schizophrenia and for our humanity. This would help to explain why schizophrenia is present to approximately the same degree in all races. It is the illness which made us human prior to the separation of the races.

TI  - Advances toward the implantable artificial pancreas for treatment of diabetes.  
AB  - Recent research on development of the implantable artificial pancreas for treatment of diabetes is reviewed, based on a Medline literature search that focused on glucose sensors, insulin pumps, and pump control systems. To achieve a closed feedback loop, a clinically applicable implantable artificial pancreas requires miniaturization and coordination of three components: an insulin pump, a blood glucose monitor, and a control system. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that implantable insulin pumps are feasible for satisfactory control of diabetes for over a year, with the major complication being obstruction of the infusion catheter. Research on continuous glucose sensors has predominantly used the glucose-oxidase reaction or near-infrared light spectroscopy. Implantable glucose oxidase sensors have been limited by local factors causing unstable signal output, whereas optical sensors must overcome interference by substances with absorption spectra similar to glucose. Investigators have developed control algorithms in an effort to stabilize operation of the integrated artificial pancreas in the face of variations in sensor output and pump function. The ultimate goals of fully automatic glucose control by an artificial pancreas include prevention or delay of chronic complications of diabetes, lowered risk of hypoglycemia, and less patient inconvenience and discomfort than with multiple daily glucose self-tests and insulin injection. The recent developments of optical glucose sensing, radiotelemetry systems to link pump and sensor, and miniaturization and refinement of insulin pumps are significant steps toward a clinically applicable artificial pancreas.

TI  - Artificial cells with emphasis on bioencapsulation in biotechnology.  
AB  - The most common use of artificial cells is for bioencapsulation of biologically active materials. Each artificial cell can contain combinations of materials. The permeability, composition and shape of an artificial cell membrane can be varied using different types of synthetic or biological materials.  These possible variations in contents and membranes allow for large variations in the properties and functions of artificial cells. Artificial cells containing adsorbents have been a routine form of treatment in hemoperfusion for patients. This includes acute poisoning, high blood aluminum and iron, and supplement to dialysis in kidney failure. Artificial red blood cell substitutes based on modified hemoglobin are already in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in patients. Artificial cell encapsulated cell cultures are being studied for the treatment of diabetes, liver failure, gene therapy and other conditions. Research on artificial cells containing enzymes includes their use for treatment in hereditary enzyme deficiency diseases and other diseases. Recent demonstration of extensive enterorecirculation of amino acids in the intestine has allowed oral administration to deplete specific amino acids. One example is phenylketonuria, an inborn error or metabolism resulting in high systemic phenylalanine levels. Preliminary clinical studies in patients using bioencapsulation of cells or enzymes have started. Artificial cells containing complex enzyme systems convert wastes like urea and ammonia into essential amino acids. Artificial cells are being used for the production of monoclonal antibodies, interferon and other biotechnological products. Other areas of biotechnological uses include drug delivery, and other areas of biotechnology, chemical engineering and medicine.

AB  - Fecal specimens from 100 healthy adults were collected and examined for the presence of Bacillus cereus which has been associated with 28% of the outbreaks of food poisoning on Taiwan within the last 3 years. Total isolate rate from these specimens was 8%.  Variations in isolation rates were found not only in sexes, but also in different age-groups. Therefore, presence of B. cereus in the feces of healthy adults may be unpredictable and relate to foods consumed or to other factors. Obviously, an isolation rate of B. cereus as high as 30% during the outbreak investigation is still not a strong evidence to implicate this organism as an etiological agent.
