TI  - Excretion of citalopram in breast milk.  
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to measure to secretion of the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram in breast milk. METHODS: The excretion of citalopram in breast milk was studied at steady-state conditions in two patients with depression and in one healthy volunteer after ingestion of a single dose citalopram. RESULTS: Milk/serum concentration ratios based on single pairs of samples from the two patients ranged from 1.16 to 1.88. Based on milk concentration data from the patients, the absolute dose ingested by a suckling infant would be 4.3-17.6 micrograms kg-1 day-1, and the relative dose 0.7-5.9% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Based on area-under-the-time-concentration curves from the healthy volunteer, the milk/serum ratio was 1.00, the absolute dose to the infant during steady-state conditions would be 11.2 micrograms kg-1 day-1 and the relative dose 1.8% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the relative dose to a suckling infant is close to that reported for fluoxetine, and higher than reported for fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline.

TI  - Reproducibility of the Wisconsin cataract grading system in the Blue Mountains Eye Study.  
AB  - PROBLEM: To measure the inter- and intra-grader reliability of the Wisconsin cataract grading system for grading of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) in the Blue Mountains Eye Study. METHODS: Random samples of lens photographs from study subjects were regraded by each grader according to the Wisconsin cataract grading system. The results were compared using quadratic weighted kappa statistics to derive measures of inter- and intra-grader reliability for the grading of nuclear (5 grades), PSC (3 grades), and cortical cataract (3 grades). RESULTS: Inter-grader reliability (quadratic weighted kappa) for grading of nuclear cataract varied between 0.82 and 0.79; kappa was 0.78 for cortical cataract and 0.57 for PSC. Intra-grader reliability was slightly higher than inter-grader reliability for all three cataract types. CONCLUSION: In the Blue Mountains Eye Study, the Wisconsin cataract grading system provided good reproducibility, comparable to that reported from the Beaver Dam Eye Study, endorsing its usefulness in cataract epidemiology.

TI  - Endothelial dysfunction and cardiorenal injury in experimental salt-sensitive hypertension: effects of antihypertensive therapy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacological control of hypertension has contributed to a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although the beneficial effect on cardiac and renal diseases has been far more modest than the reduction in stroke. The endothelium plays a crucial homeostatic role in the regulation of vascular tone thrombogenesis and vascular remodeling. We studied the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and cardiorenal injury in hypertensive rats and evaluated the effects of two classes of antihypertensive agents commonly used in the clinical setting, a diuretic (DIU) and an ACE inhibitor (CEI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS) given high dietary salt (4% NaCl) developed hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP], 218+/-9 versus 147+/-3 mm Hg in DS given 0.5% NaCl; P<.001), which was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) in aortic rings (ED50, 5.44+/-.18 versus 7.51+/-.10; P<.05) and mesenteric vessels (area under the curve, 299+/-11 versus 217+/-11 arbitrary units; P<.05). Hypertensive DS also demonstrated depressed nitric oxide synthase activity in the aorta (0.76+/-.15 versus 2.83+/-.17 nmol x min(-1) x g protein(-1); P<.05), left ventricular hypertrophy (0.43+/-.02 versus 0.29+/-.02 g ventricular weight/100 g body weight; P<.05), glomerular injury (histological injury score: 151+/-8 versus 11+/-2; P<.05), and increased urinary protein excretion (95+/-21 versus 25+/-5 mg/24 hours; P<.05). Treatment of DS rats with the CEI perindopril (4.56 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) did not affect SBP (225+/-6 mm Hg) but modestly improved EDR (ED50: 6.07+/-.37; P<.05 versus hypertensive DS) as well as proteinuria and glomerular histology. Addition of the DIU indapamide (1.44 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) normalized SBP (151+/-2 mm Hg; P<.05), EDR (ED50, 7.33+/-.08; P<.05), left ventricular hypertrophy (0.27+/-.01 g/100 g body weight; P<.05), and proteinuria (31+/-4 mg/24 hours; P<.05) and prevented glomerular injury (injury score: 30+/-2; P<.05). Monotherapy with DIU reduced SBP (175+/-3 mm Hg; P<.05) and normalized EDR and left ventricular hypertrophy but did not provide effective renal protection. In hypertensive DS, impaired EDR and left ventricular hypertrophy were positively correlated with SBP. In addition, we found a significant correlation between cardiac hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that impaired aortic EDR, and therefore decreased aortic compliance, positively contributed to left ventricular hypertrophy in addition to but independently of SBP [F(2,37)=6.29; P=.004]. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest a dissociation of the endothelial, cardiac, and renal effects of antihypertensive therapy in hypertension and may explain the variable success of antihypertensive regimens in treating hypertension while preventing cardiac and renal damage.

TI  - Effect of feeding blends of Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated grains containing deoxynivalenol and fusaric acid on growth and feed consumption of immature swine.  
AB  - Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of feeding diets containing combinations of the Fusarium metabolites deoxynivalenol (DON) and fusaric acid (FA) to starter swine. In all experiments, pigs of approximately 8.2 kg initial weight were fed diets containing blends of mycotoxin-contaminated corn, wheat, and barley for 21 d with growth and feed consumption determined weekly. In the first experiment, diets were determined to contain 0 microgram DON/g + 58.9 micrograms FA/g (control), 4.4 micrograms DON/g + 57.1 micrograms FA/g, 6.0 micrograms DON/g + 48.6 micrograms FA/g, and 7.5 micrograms DON/g + 57.4 micrograms FA/g. The feeding of all diets containing DON caused significant linear depressions in growth and feed intake after only 1 wk. Lower concentrations of DON and FA were fed in the second experiment with diets containing 0 microgram DON/g + 16.3 micrograms FA/g (control), .5 microgram DON/g + 14.3 micrograms FA/g, 1.1 micrograms DON/g + 14.1 micrograms FA/g, and 1.9 micrograms DON/g + 13.6 micrograms FA/g. There was a significant linear reduction in feed intake after 1 wk with increasing levels of dietary DON. Weight gains declined significantly only after 3 wk. Increasing amounts of FA combined with relatively constant amounts of DON were fed in the third experiment. By analysis, diets contained .5 micrograms DON/g + 2.9 micrograms FA/g (control), 2.2 micrograms DON/g + 12.2 micrograms FA/g, 2.5 micrograms DON/g + 15.6 micrograms FA/g, and 2.4 micrograms DON/g + 15.9 micrograms FA/g. In the 1st wk, the feeding of increasing amounts of fusaric acid combined with a relatively constant amount of DON caused a significant linear depression in weight gain. We concluded that a toxicological synergism exists between DON and FA when fed to immature swine and that FA concentrations in feeds should be determined whenever DON analysis is conducted.

TI  - Obesity, levels of lipids and glucose, and smoking among Navajo adolescents.  
AB  - Although there is a high prevalence of overweight among Navajo children and adolescents, other risk factors for chronic disease in this population have received little attention. We therefore examined the distribution and interrelationships of overweight, cigarette smoking, blood pressure and plasma levels of lipids and glucose among 160 Navajo 12- to 19-y-olds. In agreement with previous reports, participants were approximately 2 kg/m2 heavier than adolescents in the general U.S. population, and the prevalence of overweight (> 85th percentile) was 35-40%. Levels of total cholesterol and blood pressure were similar to those in the general U.S. population, but Navajo adolescents had a 5-10 mg/dL lower median level of HDL cholesterol, and a 30 mg/dL higher median triglyceride level. Eight percent of the adolescents examined had either impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus as assessed through an oral glucose tolerance test (n = 10) or self-report (n = 1).  Relative weight (kg/m2) was associated with adverse levels of lipids, lipoproteins and glucose, with overweight adolescents having a fivefold greater risk for elevated triglyceride levels than other adolescents. Tobacco use was fairly prevalent among boys (24% cigarettes, 23% smokeless tobacco), but not girls (9% cigarettes, 3% smokeless tobacco). Because of its associations with other risk factors and with various chronic diseases in later life, it may be beneficial to focus on the primary prevention of obesity among Navajo children and adolescents.

TI  - Integrin Mac-1 and beta-amyloid in microglial release of nitric oxide.  
AB  - The beta-amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well characterized biochemically; however, its primary biological function and mode of action in AD has not been determined. We have shown previously that beta-amyloid (beta25-35), in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), can induce nitric oxide release from cultured hippocampal microglial cells. In the present study, binding of beta-amyloid with the leukocyte integrin Mac-1, a cell surface receptor on microglia, was studied by observing (1) inhibition of beta-amyloid (beta25-35)-mediated release of nitric oxide from cultured microglial cells following exposure to monoclonal antibodies against Mac-1 (anti-CD18 and anti-CD11b) and (2) competitive binding of fluorochrome-labeled beta25-35 with anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b using fluorescent flow cytometry. Wt.3 (anti-CD18 antibody) and OX42 (anti-CD11b antibody) were as effective as opsonized zymosan at inducing the release of nitric oxide from microglia. Furthermore, Wt.3 and OX42 acted synergistically to induce maximum nitric oxide release. An interaction between beta-amyloid and CD18 of Mac-1 was evidenced by the suppressive action of beta25-35 on Wt.3-mediated release of nitric oxide and the synergistic action between OX42 and beta25-35 in inducing nitric oxide release from microglia. The tissue culture study was supported by competitive binding assays of fluorochrome-labeled beta25-35 and Mac-1 antibodies (Wt.3 or OX42). The majority of microglial cells (71%) did bind biotinylated beta-amyloid in the presence of cytochalasin B, suggesting that beta-amyloid binding to microglia is a receptor-mediated event. Furthermore, pre-exposure to Wt.3, but not OX42, significantly decreased binding of biotinylated beta25-35 to microglia. These findings suggest that CD18 of Mac-1 may play a role in beta-amyloid-mediated release of nitric oxide.

Three Greater Rheas (Rhea americana) and 5 Lesser Rheas (Pterocnemia pennata) were slaughtered, using the procedures conventional for ostriches in South Africa, in order to determine the expected yield of by-products and saleable lean meat, fat and bone of rheas. 2. Differences (P < 0.05) between species were found in the proportional weight of the wings, feet, skin and liver. The wings, feet and head of rheas form a higher proportion of the carcase than in ostriches, whereas the skin of the former represents a lower percentage of body weight. 3. Lean meat production from rheas (64% on a carcase weight basis) is in the same order as for ostriches, broilers, turkeys and beef.

TI  - In vitro tissue-digesting properties of krill enzymes compared with fibrinolysin/DNAse, papain and placebo.  
AB  - Wound debridement, the removal of necrotic tissue, can be achieved with proteolytic enzymes. Recently, a new multi-enzyme preparation, krill enzyme, isolated from Antarctic shrimp-like organisms (Euphausia superba), was reported to possess powerful proteolytic activity towards protein substrates. In this paper, we study the in vitro digestive properties of krill enzymes towards whole tissue, compared with placebo, papain, and fibrinolysin/DNAse. Freshly obtained skin specimens were exposed for 3 days to krill enzymes (3; 0.6 and 0.06 U/ml), papain (120; 60; 6 and 0.6 U/ml), fibrinolysin/DNAse (2.5/1500 E and 1/600 E), and phosphate-buffered saline control solution. Tissue digestion was estimated by measuring wet wt, dry wt, and histological examination. After 72 hr of exposure to 3 U/ml krill enzymes, the dry wt of the specimens was reduced to 2.7% +/- 1.9 (SEM, n = 5), compared with 31.0% +/- 2.7 for placebo, 25.7% +/- 2.5 for 120 U/ml papain, and 24.5% +/- 3.3 for 2.5/1500 E/ml fibrinolysin/DNAse. The differences between krill enzymes and fibrinolysin/DNAse, papain, and control solution were statistically significant (p < 0.007). These data suggest that krill enzymes are more active than other commonly available proteolytic agents used for wound debridement.

TI  - Characteristic differences of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, with special reference to liver weight at autopsy.  
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Liver weight at autopsy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been found to differ by geographic region. The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC in relation to liver weight at autopsy have not been reported for Japanese cases. METHODOLOGY: From 1980 to 1992, a total of 107 consecutive HCC autopsy cases were studied. Seven cases were excluded (5 surgically resected cases and 2 cases of occult-type HCC (Berman) which were diagnosed at autopsy for the first time). The 100 cases of HCC were divided into 4 groups according to liver weight at autopsy: less than 999 g (group A, n = 15, 15%); 1000-1999 g (group B, n = 50, 50%); 2,000-2,999 g (group C, n = 20, 20%); and more than 3,000 g (group D, n = 15, 15%). Various clinical and pathological findings, including age, sex, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status, history of blood transfusions, treatment, cause of death, underlying liver disease, survival after diagnosis, tumor size, macroscopic findings, microscopic findings, splenic weight and liver weight were studied. RESULTS: Significant differences between groups were found in sex (p < 0.01), underlying liver disease (p < 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.0001), microscopic findings (p < 0.001) and survival (p < 0.01). The lowest liver weight group (group A) had a significantly longer mean survival rate than the other three groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that 15% of HCC occurred in large size livers (more than 3,000 g), 15% occurred in small size livers (less than 999 g) and 70% occurred in livers between 1,000 g and 2,999 g, and that tumor size (p < 0.0001) and microscopic findings (p < 0.001) were the major determinants of liver weight in HCC patients. The total liver volume reflected by liver weight in HCC cases may be valuable for the assessment of the clinicopathological features of HCC and its prognosis.

TI  - [Comparison of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance with fast sequences with and without paramagnetic contrast media in the assessment of liver metastasis: qualitative and quantitative analysis]  
AB  - We compared unenhanced and contrast-enhanced fast MRI and CT in the detection of liver metastases. Eleven patients with single or multiple hepatic lesions (42 in all) were submitted to CT and MR studies; T1- and T2-weighted TSE, T2-weighted TSE with fat suppression, unenhanced breath-hold TFE and early or delayed enhanced breath-hold TFE images were acquired with a 1.5 T super-conductive magnet (Philips NT). The quantitative analysis of all MR images was performed for contrast/noise ratio (CNR) and number of detected lesions; MR and CT images were also compared qualitatively for lesion conspicuity, anatomical structure identification and artifacts. The results were compared with Student's t test. Early enhanced breath-hold TFE was statistically superior to T1-weighted TSE (p = .0009), T2-weighted TSE (p = .01) and CT (p = .0004) for lesion conspicuity and to T1-weighted TSE, T2-weighted TSE, unenhanced TFE (p = .0001) and CT (p = .01) for anatomical structure identification. CT was superior to T1- and T2-weighted TSE (p = .0001) and unenhanced TFE (p = .004) for the lack of artifacts. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted TSE images had a statistically higher CNR than T2-weighted TSE (p = .02), T1-weighted TSE (p = .0006) and unenhanced and delayed TFE sequences (p = .007; p = .0001, respectively). To conclude, MRI appears superior to CT in the detection of liver metastases; the examination should include early enhanced breath-hold T1-weighted TFE and T2-weighted fat-suppressed TSE images.

TI  - Health effects of diesel emissions [see comments]  
AB  - We have reviewed the literature relating to the health effects of diesel emissions with particular reference to acute and chronic morbidity and to carcinogenicity. It is apparent that exposure to diesel fumes in sufficient concentrations may lead to eye and nasal irritation but there is no evidence of any permanent effect. A transient decline of ventilatory capacity has been noted following such exposures. There is also some evidence that the chronic inhalation of diesel fumes leads to the development of cough and sputum, that is chronic bronchitis, however, it is usually impossible to show a cause and effect relationship because of the concomitant and confounding exposures to mine dust and cigarette smoke. Although there have been a number of papers suggesting that diesel fumes may act as an carcinogen, the weight of the evidence is against this hypothesis. Finally, the role of small particles, less than 10 microns, which are frequently present in diesel emissions requires further study since there is some limited evidence that they may be partly responsible for some of the exacerbations of asthma.

TI  - The validation of three human reliability quantification techniques--THERP, HEART and JHEDI: Part III--Practical aspects of the usage of the techniques.  
AB  - This is the third paper in a series of three dealing with the detailed investigation of the empirical validity of three human reliability assessment (HRA) techniques. The first paper introduced the need for validation and specified the three techniques most requiring validation. The second paper detailed the results of an extensive independent validation experiment. This experimental validation involved 30 UK assessors using the techniques THERP, HEART and JHEDI (10 assessors per technique) to estimate the human error probabilities (HEPs) for 30 nuclear power and reprocessing (NP&R) tasks. The results for all three techniques were positive in terms of significant correlations, and general precision levels of 72% of all HEP estimates within a factor of 10 of the true value (unknown to the assessors). These results lend support to the empirical validity of these techniques in particular, and to HRA in general. However, the results were not all positive. In particular the consistency of usage of the techniques was variable. Additionally, subjects were generally not good at knowing their own uncertainty, i.e. they were not able to accurately predict when they were accurate nor when they were inaccurate. This desirable parameter is known as calibration, and the results from the validation suggested that subjects were not well-calibrated. This paper aims to determine how consistency of usage can be improved and to discern whether certain task types are, in practice, not well-assessed by the techniques, and hence are effectively currently beyond these techniques' abilities. Such information is aimed at aiding the HRA practitioner, or the ergonomist, interested in using these techniques. Recommendations for improving calibration are also discussed in this paper. A subsidiary but important focus of this paper is of a more fundamental nature, and of more general interest to the ergonomist. It concerns the validity of the techniques from an error reduction perspective. Currently these techniques may be used to identify how to reduce error probability, which is generally (in the qualitative sense) within the domain of ergonomics. One major mechanism for HRA-based error reduction is the utilisation of Performance Shaping Factor (PSF) information. This paper considers the validity of these PSF as ergonomics constructs. Drawing results from the validation exercise, it is seen how different PSF can be applied to the same scenario and can result in the same error probability, but will result in different error reduction guidance. It is therefore recommended that error reduction guidance must be based on a composite analysis of the results of the task, error identification and quantification analyses, with most weighting given to the qualitative analyses.

AB  - The effect of permethrin on relative liver weight (RLW) and the activity of hepatic monooxygenase system related to cytochrome P-4502B and 2A was studies. The effect of permethrin was compared with DDT used as phenobarbital-type of monooxygenase inducer (induces cyt. P-4502B). Male Wistar rats received permethrin and DDT for 4 days at 24 h intervals in daily oral doses of 1/10, 1/50 and 1/100 LD50. 3-methylocholantrene and phenobarbital which served as inducers of cytochrome P-4501A and 2B, respectively and were used as positive controls. The activities of cytochrome(s) P-450 were measured by 7-pentoxy- and 7-etoxyresofurin O-dealkylation by S-9 fraction of rat liver; these two compounds have been shown to be the substrates for reactions mediated by cytochrome P-4502B and 2A. Thus this biochemical procedure permits to determine whether tested compound belongs to one of two main types of inducers of the cytochrome P-450 monoxygenase system. Treatment of rats with both pesticides resulted in significant increase in RLW, to 30 and 15% of control, respectively. In animals treated with permethrin the metabolism of 7-pentoxyresofurin increased in a dose dependent manner. Phenobarbital and the highest dose of permethrin (620 mg/kg b.w. x day-1) induced similar (about 30-fold) increase in O-dealkylation of 7-pentoxyresofurin. DDT stimulated metabolism of 7-pentoxyresofurin to much higher degree as compared with phenobarbital. It should be noted that both pesticides induced only slight increase in O-dealkylation of 7-etoxyresofurin (cyt. P-4501A-mediated reaction). The present results indicate that permethrin as well as DDT shows the ability to induce the phenobarbital-type of cytochrome P-4502B.

TI  - [Localized lesions on MRI in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nuclei and hippocampus in patients with severe intellectual and motor disabilities]  
AB  - We examined the clinical picture of eight patients with severe intellectual and motor disabilities, who had experienced prolonged and severe neonatal jaundice, and showed localized lesions in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nuclei and hippocampus on MRI. All patients had athetoid tetraplegia, and five patients showed disturbed ocular movements and seven showed dysphagia. Five patients could communicate with others or utter words, and all showed mental retardation. Auditory brainstem responses were abnormal in seven, and the percentage of REM sleep on all-night polysomnography was reduced in three. Neither CT nor T1-weighted MR images could detect any changes in the pallidum or subthalamic nuclei, while T2-weighted MR images disclosed bilateral high signals in the pallidum, especially in the internal segment, in all patients. Five of the 7 patients, in whom coronal T2-weighted MR imagings were obtained, showed high signals in the subthalamic nuclei. The hippocampus showed atrophy and/or T2-prolongation in seven patients. In one autopsy case, these MRI changes were concordant with pathological lesions. In patients with athetoid cerebral palsy, brainstem dysfunctions, and abnormal ABR, localization of MRI lesions to the pallidum and subthalamic nuclei is evidence for neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy.

TI  - Impact of physical activity on cardiovascular risk factors in IDDM.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of physical activity on glycemic control and plasma lipids [HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL-C subfractions, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a)], blood pressure, weight, and abdominal fat and to determine the necessary short-term adaptations in diabetes management during intensive endurance training in patients with IDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Well-controlled subjects with IDDM (n = 20; HbA1c = 7.6%) engaged in a regular exercise program over a period of 3 months involving endurance sports such as biking, long-distance running, or hiking. Subjects were instructed to exercise at least 135 min per week. If baseline activity exceeded this level, subjects were to increase further their physical activity as much as possible and record the type and time of such activity. RESULTS: During the 3-month intervention, physical activity increased from 195 +/- 176 to 356 +/- 164 min (mean +/- SD) per week (P < 0.001). Physical fitness as assessed by VO2max increased from 2,914 +/- 924 to 3,092 +/- 905 ml/min (P < 0.001), and insulin sensitivity increased significantly (steady-state plasma glucose [SSPG] decreased from 10.5 +/- 4.8 to 7.0 +/- 3.3 mmol/l; P < 0.01). Subsequently, LDL cholesterol decreased by 14% (P < 0.05), and HDL and HDL3-C subfraction increased by 10 (P < 0.05) and 16% (P < 0.05), respectively. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly from 127 +/- 9 to 124 +/- 8 (P < 0.05) and from 80 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 5 mmHg (P < 0.01), respectively. Resting heart rate decreased from 63 +/- 6 to 59 +/- 7 bpm (P < 0.01). Waist-to-hip circumference ratio decreased from 0.882 +/- 0.055 to 0.858 +/- 0.053 (P < 0.001), body weight decreased from 70.7 +/- 10.4 to 68.7 +/- 10.2 kg (P = 0.003), with a consequent decrease in body fat from 21.9 +/- 8.2 to 18.0 +/- 6.3% (P < 0.001) and an increase in lean body mass from 54.9 +/- 12.2 to 56.8 +/- 11.0 kg. These effects occurred independently of glycemic control. The overall frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes was reduced from 0.14 to 0.10 per patient-year during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that increasing physical activity is safe and does not result in more hypoglycemic episodes and that there is a linear dose-response between increased physical activity and loss of abdominal fat and a decrease in blood pressure and lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors, with a preferential increase in the HDL3-C subfraction.

TI  - Transformation suppression by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B requires a functional SH3 ligand.  
AB  - We have recently shown that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) associates with the docking protein p130Cas in 3Y1 rat fibroblasts. This interaction is mediated by a proline-rich sequence on PTP1B and the SH3 domain on p130Cas. Expression of wild-type PTP1B (WT-PTP1B), but not a catalytically competent, proline-to-alanine point mutant that cannot bind p130Cas (PA-PTP1B), causes substantial tyrosine dephosphorylation of p130Cas (F. Liu, D. E. Hill, and J. Chernoff, J. Biol. Chem. 271:31290-31295, 1996). Here we demonstrate that WT-, but not PA-PTP1B, inhibits transformation of rat 3Y1 fibroblasts by v-crk, -src, and -ras, but not by v-raf. These effects on transformation correlate with the phosphorylation status of p130Cas and two proteins that are associated with p130Cas, Paxillin and Fak. Expression of WT-PTP1B reduces formation of p130Cas-Crk complexes and inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by Src and Crk. These data show that transformation suppression by PTP1B requires a functional SH3 ligand and suggest that p130Cas may represent an important physiological target of PTP1B in cells.

TI  - Simultaneous quantification of an enantiomer and the racemic compound of ibuprofen by X-ray powder diffractometry.  
AB  - PURPOSE: An X-ray powder diffractometric method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of the relative amounts of the racemic compound (+/-) of ibuprofen (I) and S(+)-ibuprofen (II), when they occur as a mixture. METHOD: The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of I and II show pronounced differences. This formed the basis for the determination of the relative amounts of I and II when they occur as a mixture. X-ray lines with d-spacings of 14.41 and 4.37 A were unique to I and II, respectively. Mixtures containing different proportions of I and II were prepared which also contained lithium fluoride (III) as an internal standard. RESULTS: A linear relationship was obtained when the intensity ratio (intensity of the 4.37 A line of II/intensity of the 2.01 A line of III) was plotted as a function of the weight fraction of II in the mixture. Similar results were obtained in the case of I. Using these standard curves, the weight fractions of I and II in "unknown" mixtures were determined. The experimentally determined analyte concentration ranged between 98 and 104% of the true value. The relative error in the analyses of individual samples was < 10%.  The minimum detectable weight fraction of I and II and II in I were 0.032 (3.2% w/w) and 0.034 (3.4% w/w), respectively. The minimum quantifiable weight fractions were 0.136 for I and 0.112 for II. Since the X-ray diffraction patterns of S(+)-ibuprofen and R(-)-ibuprofen are identical, the conclusions drawn regarding mixtures of I and II will also hold true in the quantitative analyses of mixtures of I and R(-)-ibuprofen.

TI  - Perceptions of effort and heaviness during fatigue and during the size-weight illusion.  
AB  - Previous work has shown that force perception and the sense of motor effort are different attributes of sensorimotor function. This study explores the hypothesis that one reason force and effort perceptions are distinct is to inform an individual of impaired motor function when muscular force lags effort. This hypothesis predicts that effort and force perceptions will dissociate when motor function is impaired by fatigue but not during the size-weight illusion. All subjects reported a distinct increase in effort when lifting a standard test weight as fatigue developed. When fatigue was sufficiently marked so that they could barely lift the test weight, they rated their effort as similar to that required to lift a maximal weight in the unfatigued state. The perceived heaviness of the test weight also increased as fatigue developed, but this fatigue-weight illusion was smaller than the increase in effort for all subjects and displayed greater variability. In contrast, both the perceived weight of a small object and the effort required to lift it increased in parallel when small and large objects were lifted sequentially. The size-weight and size-effort illusions appear to be examples of a common phenomenon in which perceptual experience is rescaled to maintain acuity under different working conditions. The fatigue-weight illusion also has the effect of increasing perceptual acuity as the subject's weight lifting range decreases due to fatigue.

TI  - Morbidity and growth performance of infants in Madura, Indonesia.  
AB  - Between January 1987 and July 1988, all children born in two villages on the island of Madura, Indonesia were visited weekly by a field worker trained to interview mothers on disease symptoms. The maximum recall period was 1 week. All infants were measured (weight and height) at monthly intervals. Information on growth and morbidity is analysed for infants from birth until the age of 11 months. Morbidity, defined as acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), diarrhoea, fever and other diseases, is analysed over 4-week periods and related to growth performance. In total, there are 1373 4-week reporting periods with morbidity information from birth to the age of 12 months. Of all the diseases recorded (1021), 47% were ARI, 13% diarrhoea, 14% fever and 26% other diseases. The average (SD) duration of diarrhoea was 7 (11) days, ARI 14 (9) days, fever 6 (4) days and 16 (10) days for other diseases. The most striking results in this analysis are: (i) the lack of a relationship between morbidity and growth (either linear or weight) during the 1st 6 months of life; (ii) the existence of a relationship between illness and weight increment for which only ARI showed significant influence for infants of 6 months and more; (iii) the lack of a relationship between morbidity and linear growth performance at all ages; and (iv) the fact that no cumulative effect of disease on growth performance was found to explain the observations.

TI  - MRI of pelvic masses: efficacy of the rectal superparamagnetic contrast agent Ferumoxsil.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the potential value of rectally administered Ferumoxsil for pelvic MRI. Twenty patients with suspected rectosigmoid and ovarian tumors were prospectively examined before and after rectal administration of 300 to 600 ml of the superparamagnetic contrast agent Ferumoxsil. Imaging parameters (1.5-T system, phased-array coil, transverse T1-weighted spin echo (SE) and T2-weighted turbo-SE sequences, 6-mm slice thickness, 350-mm field of view [FOV], 512 x 512 matrix) were kept constant. Images were evaluated for tumor presence, lymphadenopathy, bowel involvement, and peritoneal implants. Precontrast and postcontrast studies were rated for bowel delineation, lesion/organ-to-bowel differentiation, presence of artifacts, and confidence of diagnosis. Delineation of rectum and sigmoid colon (P < .001) as well as separation of bowel and vagina, uterus/adnexa, dome of the urinary bladder, lymph nodes, and vessels improved significantly (P < .01) on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted postcontrast sequences. The rectal contrast agent did not increase the level of artifacts. Changes in diagnosis in 7 of 20 patients were mainly due to identification of colorectal tumors or bowel involvement on postcontrast images. The readers' diagnostic confidence was significantly higher on contrast-enhanced than on unenhanced studies (93 +/- 6.4% vs 68 +/- 25.2%). Rectal application of Ferumoxsil improves lesion/organ-to-bowel delineation and overall diagnostic confidence in pelvic MRI.

TI  - RARE imaging of PCr in human forearm muscles.  
AB  - Rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequences have been used to map the 31P phosphocreatine (PCr) signal in human forearms at 4.7 T. Signal-to-noise levels of approximately 10 were achieved from the major muscle groups in 5.5-minute scan times with a spatial resolution of 4 x 2 x 2 cm3. Exercise caused demonstrable reductions in PCr signal from activated muscles, which correlated with affected muscle groups in T2-weighted proton images. RARE imaging of the PCr signal at 4.7 T is feasible and, with technically achievable improvements in signal-to-noise ratio, should prove useful in studying energy metabolism in muscle and other organs.

TI  - The effects of dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid on the phospholipid fatty acid composition of avian spermatozoa.  
AB  - This study represents an attempt at the dietary manipulation of the fatty acid composition of chicken spermatozoa in order to enhance the levels of n-3 polyunsaturates at the expense of the n-6 fatty acids, which normally predominate in the lipids of avian semen. Male chickens were provided with either a control diet supplemented with maize oil or the test diet supplemented with fish oil (Tuna Orbital Oil) from 10 weeks of age. Semen samples were collected from the birds after 30 and 48 weeks of supplementation. The fish oil diet induced a significant but limited increase in the proportion of 22:6n-3 in the spermatozoan phospholipid in parallel with an equivalent decrease in the proportions of 20:4n-6 and 22:4n-6. However, since the maximal level of 22:6n-3 in the phospholipid that was achieved by fish oil feeding was less than 10% (wt/wt of fatty acids), these changes fell far short of representing a switch from the typical avian pattern to that more characteristic of the n-3 enriched mammalian semen. Analysis of the fatty acid compositions of the constituent classes of phospholipid in the spermatozoa indicated that, in both dietary states, the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction contained much greater proportions of n-6 and n-3 C20-22 polyunsaturates than the phosphatidylcholine fraction. The results indicate that the typical fatty acid profile of the spermatozoa of domesticated poultry, characterised by the predominance of C20-22 n-6 polyunsaturates, displays a considerable degree of resistance to manipulation by dietary means and does not adopt the "mammalian" type of profile following supplementation with n-3 fatty acids.

TI  - The relationship between variations in knee replacement utilization rates and the reported prevalence of arthritis in Ontario, Canada.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To determine the relationship between regional variations in knee replacement (KR) utilization rates in Ontario, Canada, and the reported prevalence of arthritis and rheumatism as a chronic health problem. METHODS. Utilization data were acquired from the Canadian Institute for Health Information for KR procedures performed in Ontario between fiscal years 1984 and 1990. Census information was obtained from Statistics Canada. Disease prevalence data were derived from the 1990 Ontario Health Survey (OHS). Public Health Units (PHU) were used as the unit of analysis, with utilization rates defined as the number of KR performed on all PHU residents (irrespective of where these procedures were performed) divided by the population. Direct methods were used to standardize utilization for age, sex, and disease prevalence. The extremal quotient, the weighted coefficient of variation, and the systematic component of variation were used as measures of variation. The relationship between the number of KR performed in each age-sex-year strata and various demographic (age and sex), disease prevalence, and regional dummy variables was estimated using a Poisson regression model. RESULTS. Regional variation in the standardized utilization of KR surgery was wide, but declined over the study period; the extremal quotient fell from 8.0 to 3.3, the weighted coefficient of variation fell from 0.49 to 0.30, and the systematic component of variation fell from 0.20 to 0.17. Variation in the provision of KR surgery remained even after controlling for the demographic composition of the population and disease prevalence. Moreover, while demographic, regional, and temporal covariates were significant (p < 0.0001) in accounting for over 90% of the variation in utilization, disease prevalence was not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION. This study merged population based reports of disease prevalence with administrative data to account for regional variations in utilization. While regional variations in KR surgery have fallen over time, variations remain even after adjusting for patient reported disease prevalence. The finding that demographic variables and the reported prevalence of disease were poorly correlated suggests that current area variation studies may not be adjusting fully for disease prevalence or severity.

TI  - Half-dose gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging with magnetization transfer technique in brain tumors: comparison with conventional contrast-enhanced MR imaging [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether half-dose enhanced MR imaging with magnetization transfer (MT) saturation can replace standard-dose enhanced MR imaging without MT saturation in patients who have brain tumors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three sets of enhanced T1-weighted MR images were prospectively obtained for each of 25 patients with 32 brain tumors; the first conventional MR images without MT were obtained after administration of standard-dose (0.1-mmol/kg) gadopentetate dimeglumine. Within 1 week, patients underwent administration of one half-dose (0.05 mmol/kg) of the contrast medium, and then two sets of enhanced T1-weighted images were obtained with and then without MT. The degree of contrast enhancement was assessed qualitatively for all 32 tumors and quantitatively for 26 tumors. In the quantitative analysis, we compared mean values for tumor-brain contrast-to-noise ratios in three sets of images. RESULTS: The visual conspicuity of enhancing lesions in half-dose T1-weighted MR images with MT was comparable with that of standard-dose conventional T1-weighted MR images in 43% of cases including most extraaxial tumors. In approximately 75% of cases, the degree of enhancement of the lesions was similar for half-dose T1-weighted images obtained with and without MT. Overall, mean values for tumor-brain contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly lower in half-dose T1-weighted images with MT than in standard-dose T1-weighted images. Also, mean values for tumor-brain contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher in half-dose T1-weighted images with MT than in half-dose T1-weighted images without MT. CONCLUSION: Because half-dose enhanced MR imaging with MT yields enhancement comparable with that of standard-dose enhanced conventional MR imaging in less than 50% of cases, the former technique would replace the latter in only limited cases such as selected extraaxial tumors.

TI  - GRASE (gradient- and spin-echo) MR of the brain.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical utility of GRASE (gradient- and spin-echo) MR imaging of the brain by comparing it with the T2-weighted turbo spin-echo technique. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients referred for MR imaging of the brain were studied with T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and GRASE techniques, matched for effective echo time (110 milliseconds), echo train length (eight), and spatial resolution. The examinations were evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists for lesion detection (high- and low-signal-intensity lesions) and lesion conspicuity, and for susceptibility, motion, and chemical-shift artifacts. RESULTS: The GRASE technique provided greater detection of both high- and low-signal-intensity lesions and of low-signal-intensity lesions with paramagnetic susceptibility characteristics (ie, calcium and hemorrhage). Chemical-shift artifacts in the frequency-encoding direction were more prominent with the turbo spin-echo technique, whereas chemical-shift artifacts in the phase-encoding direction were more prominent with the GRASE technique. There was no significant difference in the degree of diamagnetic susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull, or in motion artifacts. CONCLUSION: T2-weighted GRASE is a fast imaging technique with a potential for replacing turbo spin-echo in routine MR imaging of the brain. GRASE maintains the contrast resolution of turbo spin-echo imaging and is better at depicting lesions with paramagnetic susceptibility characteristics.

Repeated injections of IHP-12 induced resistance of the liver cells to its anti-proliferative effect. After intraperitoneal injection, IHP-12 is localized in the cytosol and to a lesser extent, in cell nuclei. IHP-12 is degraded in the cytosol but in nuclei it retained its native structure for at least 8 h. The mechanism of induced resistance to IHP-12 was not related to a change in cell binding of IHP-12, its distribution in cellular compartments, and intracellular metabolism. The induced resistance may be associated with a change in the direction of IHP-12 activity, i.e., change in its function in the animal.

AB  - The relationship between therapeutic response to racemic mianserin and steady-state plasma concentrations of S(+)- and R(-)-mianserin was studied in 26 Japanese patients with major depression. The daily dose of mianserin was 30 mg, and the duration of treatment was 3 weeks. Regarding S-mianserin, the proportion of responders (final Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score of 10 or less) was significantly higher in the plasma concentration range of 10 to 23 ng/mL than outside (10 of 11 vs. 3 of 15, p = 0.0005). Such a plasma concentration difference between responders and nonresponders was not found for R-mianserin. In 15 patients, the relationships between the CYP2D6 genotype, determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis and Escherichia coli RI restriction fragment length polymorphism, plasma concentrations of the enantiomers, and the therapeutic response were studied. Five patients were homozygous for the wild type (wt) allele (wt/wt), nine were heterozygous for the CYP2D6Ch (Ch) allele causing decreased CYP2D6 activity (Ch/wt), and one patient was heterozygous for the Ch allele and the defect allele CYP2D6D (D) (Ch/D). The Ch/wt group showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of S-mianserin (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 6 vs. 8 +/- 1 ng/mL, p = 0.007) and proportion of responders (8 of 9 vs. 1 of 5, p = 0.023) than the wt/wt group. The patient with the Ch/D genotype had the highest plasma concentration of S-mianserin (37 ng/mL) and a poor response. No significant relationship was found between the CYP2D6 genotype and plasma concentration of R-mianserin. The study presented here thus suggests that the CYP2D6 genotype plays a major role in controlling plasma concentration of the S-enantiomer of mianserin, which contributes to a major extent to the antidepressant effect during mianserin treatment.

TI  - Impact of nutrition education on health of the mother and newborn belonging to the poor urban slum community.  
AB  - To find the nutritional knowledge among mothers of one child of the poor community and to relate status of education to the nutritional health of them and the newborn and to get a thorough knowledge on the impact of nutritional education, a comprehensive study was undertaken in an urban slum area. Nutritional grading was done through scoring system. There were 47 mothers (24.1%) out of 195 having normal nutritional grade and 37 mothers (19%) having severe nutritional grade. There were 80 mothers having 'no knowledge' on maternal nutrition. 'Adequate knowledge' was found in 31 cases. Mothers (n = 80) of 'no knowledge' delivered babies of average weight 2.3 kg whereas 'adequate knowledge' mothers gave birth to babies of average weight 2.9 kg.

TI  - The effect of orally administered clodronate on bone mineral density and bone geometry in ovariectomized rats.  
AB  - The effects of clodronate administered p.o. on bone mineral density (BMD), bone geometry and strength of bone were investigated in 6-month-old ovariectomized rats. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups. Three groups were ovariectomized (OVX) and one group was sham-operated (SHAM). The OVX groups were given p.o. either clodronate (100 mg/kg/d or 500 mg/kg/d) or a vehicle. The SHAM group received the vehicle. Treatments started on the day of OVX and continued for 3 months. BMD of proximal tibial metaphysis was measured by computed tomography in vivo 1 day before OVX and 6 and 12 weeks after OVX. At the end of the study, left tibiae and femora were removed for ex vivo BMD and bone geometry measurement. A three-point bending test of the tibial shaft was carried out, and ash weights of femur and tibia were determined. OVX induced a marked decrease in total and trabecular BMD over time at the proximal tibial metaphysis. This bone loss was prevented by clodronate. Clodronate also prevented the decrease in BMD and change in bone geometry at distal and proximal femur, as well as the decrease in total ash weight of femur and tibia. OVX did not cause any marked changes in cortical BMD or bone geometry at the level of mid-diaphysis of tibia or femur over a 3-month period. Neither were there any changes between groups in bending strength in the tibial diaphysis. However, a positive correlation (n = 58, r = 0.51, P < .001) was found between bending strength and calculated density-weighted polar moment of resistance of tibial diaphysis. We conclude that clodronate administered p.o. in adult rats prevents changes due to estrogen deficiency in BMD and bone geometry.

TI  - Obesity and reproduction.  
AB  - Obesity produces a variety of alterations in the reproductive system and, similarly, manipulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis produce changes in food intake, body weight and fat distribution. In men, the primary effects of obesity are a weight related reduction in testosterone and, with massive overweight, a reduction in free testosterone. In females, the weight-related development of menarche leads to earlier menarche in obese girls than in normal weight girls. One explanation for the relationship of fatness to menarche may be the ob protein (leptin) which is defective in the obese (ob/ob) mouse. Leptin is secreted by adipose tissue in proportion to the quantity of fat and may serve as a signal to the hypothalamus that fat stores are adequate to nourish a conceptus to term. In women, parity affects obesity and obesity in turn affects the regularity of the menstrual cycle. In many experimental animals with obesity, particularly the genetic forms of obesity, there is complete infertility in the females and marked impairment of reproductive function in the males. In animals with hypothalamic lesions, there is a gender effect on the magnitude of weight gain associated with the sexually dimorphic regions in the medial preoptic area. Castration with removal of oestrogen is followed by obesity in female animals and this can be prevented, as can most forms of obesity, by adrenalectomy. The inhibitory effects of oestrogen on food intake may result from suppression of neuropeptide-Y or galanin peptidergic systems in the arcuate nucleus or medial preoptic area.

TI  - Expression of exogenous wt-p53 does not affect normal hematopoiesis: implications for bone marrow purging.  
AB  - Some gene therapy approaches for cancer treatment attempt to transduce onco-suppressor genes into tumor cells. A central problem of this strategy is the targeting of tumor cells to avoid damage to normal ones. It has been noticed that transduction of wt-p53 into a large number of cancer cells induces tumor suppression. In contrast, some observations suggest that introduction of exogenous wt-p53 into nontransformed cells does not impair proliferation. If normal bone marrow (BM) cells are not affected by wt-p53 transduction, BM purging from p53-responding leukemic cells might be achieved in vitro by delivering the wild-type onco-suppressor to all marrow cells. We undertook a series of experiments to assess whether transduction of wt-p53 into normal hematopoietic cells is harmful. Two different wt-p53-recombinant retroviruses were used to infect primary, murine BM cells. Expression of exogenous wt-p53 in these cells did not affect in vitro colony formation, and did not induce any observable effects on morphology and differentiation. In contrast, the same viruses suppressed the tumor phenotype of v-src-transformed 32D cells. These results might open the way to gene therapy approaches to leukemias with the p53 gene without the need to target specifically and uniquely the tumor cells, sparing the normal ones.

TI  - Comparison of lithium dosage methods for preschool- and early school-age children.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lithium may be useful in the treatment of prepubertal children with bipolar disorder or aggressive conduct disorder. However, there are few dosage guidelines. This study compares two dosage methods reported for prescribing lithium to prepubertal children: (1) a weight-based dosing schedule and (2) a single-dose, kinetics-based method. METHOD: Lithium doses were calculated using each method and then compared with doses actually used in the clinical care of hospitalized children. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between mean lithium dose estimates calculated by the two methods. Average lithium dose estimates for both kinetic and weight-based methods were less than the observed discharge doses. Differences were seen between the two methods for children weighing between 25 and 30 kg. CONCLUSIONS: The weight-based dosing schedule and the single-dose, kinetics-based methods for calculating lithium dose result in similar dosage estimates when applied to young children.

TI  - Auditory discrimination of material changes in a struck-clamped bar.  
AB  - The principles of theoretical acoustics were applied to approximately reconstruct the sound pressure waveform at the ear as would be generated by an idealized struck-clamped bar. The result is an inharmonic sum of damped sinusoids whose individual acoustic parameters (frequency, intensity, and decay modulus) are, for a fixed geometry and fixed driving force, uniquely determined by the material composition of the bar. In the standard 2IFC procedure, listeners were asked to discriminate changes in material composition based on their perception of the acoustic waveform. Listener strategies for discriminating such changes were estimated by perturbing slightly the individual acoustic parameters from trial to trial and computing correlations with the listener's response [cf. R. A. Lutfi and E. Oh, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 2963(A) (1994)]. In general, the correlations reveal that listeners fail to make optimal use of the information in the acoustic waveform by tending to give undue weight, for a given material change, to changes in component frequency. In some case, the accompanying reduction in performance efficiency amounted to 80%.

TI  - Validation of benzene exposure assessment.  
AB  - We conducted a methodologic study to validate a quantitative retrospective exposure assessment method used in a follow-up study of workers exposed to benzene. Assessment of exposure to benzene was carried out in 672 factories in 12 cities in China. Historical exposure data were collected for 3179 unique job titles. The basic unit for exposure assessment was a factory/work-unit/job-title combination over seven periods between 1949 and 1987. A total of 18,435 exposure estimates was developed, using all available historical information, including 8477 monitoring data. Overall, 38% of the estimates were based on benzene monitoring data.  The highest time-weighted average exposures occurred in the rubber industry (30.7 ppm), particularly for rubber glue applicators (52.6 ppm). Because of its recognized link with benzene exposure, the association between a clinical diagnosis of benzene poisoning (hematotoxicity) and benzene exposure was evaluated (412 cases and 614,509 person-years) to validate the exposure-assessment method. Relative risks of benzene hematotoxicity increased very sharply with increasing estimated intensity of benzene exposure. Odds ratios were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7-2.9), 4.7 (95% CI: 3.4-6.5), and 7.2 (95% CI: 5.3-9.8) for the intensity levels of less than 5 ppm, 5-19 ppm, 20-39 ppm, and 40 and more ppm, respectively. This sharp trend between benzene hematotoxicity and estimated exposure to benzene indicated that the exposure-estimation method used in this cancer epidemiology study is reliable.

PMID- 9436987
TI  - Plasma membrane localization of G alpha z requires two signals.  
AB  - Three covalent attachments anchor heterotrimeric G proteins to cellular membranes: the alpha subunits are myristoylated and/or palmitoylated, whereas the gamma chain is prenylated. Despite the essential role of these modifications in membrane attachment, it is not clear how they cooperate to specify G protein localization at the plasma membrane, where the G protein relays signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effector molecules. To explore this question, we studied the effects of mutations that prevent myristoylation and/or palmitoylation of an epitope-labeled alpha subunit, alpha z. Wild-type alpha z (alpha z-WT) localizes specifically at the plasma membrane. A mutant that incorporates only myristate is mistargeted to intracellular membranes, in addition to the plasma membrane, but transduces hormonal signals as well as does alpha z-WT. Removal of the myristoylation site produced a mutant alpha z that is located in the cytosol, is not efficiently palmitoylated, and does not relay the hormonal signal. Coexpression of beta gamma with this myristoylation defective mutant transfers it to the plasma membrane, promotes its palmitoylation, and enables it to transmit hormonal signals. Pulse-chase experiments show that the palmitate attached to this myristoylation-defective mutant turns over much more rapidly than does palmitate on alpha z-WT, and that the rate of turnover is further accelerated by receptor activation. In contrast, receptor activation does not increase the slow rate of palmitate turnover on alpha z-WT. Together these results suggest that myristate and beta gamma promote stable association with membranes not only by providing hydrophobicity, but also by stabilizing attachment of palmitate. Moreover, palmitoylation confers on alpha z specific localization at the plasma membrane.

TI  - Persistent diarrhoea in Nigerian children aged less than five years: a hospital-based study.  
AB  - To identify possible risk factors for persistent diarrhoea, 307 children with acute diarrhoea presenting at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria over a 10-month period from July 1993 to April 1994 were followed up prospectively until the resolution of the illness. The children were aged 6-60 months. In 36 (11.7%) of them, diarrhoea became persistent (i.e. lasted more than 14 days). This hospital frequency of 11.7% of persistent diarrhoea is, as expected, higher than the figures from previous community-based studies of diarrhoea from Nigeria. The major factor associated with persistent diarrhoea was poor nutritional status. Mean z scores of weight-for-height and weight-for-age were significantly lower in the persistent diarrhoea group, while mean z scores of height-for-age were similar in the two groups. The frequencies of occurrence of undernutrition, marasmus and kwashiorkor were also higher in the persistent diarrhoea group. Therefore, in common with studies from other regions of the world, malnutrition is an important risk factor for persistent diarrhoea in this group of Nigerian children. The implication of these findings is that reduction in the prevalence of malnutrition may be associated with reduction in the proportion of acute diarrhoeal episodes that eventually progress to persistent diarrhoea.

AB  - The clinical and postsurgical TNM classifications (cTNM and pTNM) for neuroblastoma (NB), nephroblastoma (WT) and soft tissue sarcomas were presented in 1982 by the TNM Committee in UICC in collaboration with SIOP. The Japanese TNM Committee proposed new pTNM systems (J-pTNM) for NB and WT, and new cTNM and pTNM system for primary liver carcinoma in infants and children (HT). These pTNMs were based on the staging systems developed by the Malignant Tumor Committee of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Surgeons. The proposal of subdivision of M category in NB was presented for testing the new telescopic ramifications of TNM. The TNM for HT was added as a new classification recommended for testing. The effectiveness of these TNM systems was assessed using NB, WT and hepatoblastoma (HB) cases which were registered in collaborating institutes. The analyses suggested that pTNM, especially the J-pTNM system in NB, WT and HT were effective for the assessment of prognoses, although cTNM systems were not enough to assess the extent of the disease.

TI  - Electron probe microanalysis and transverse microradiography studies of artificial lesions in enamel and dentin: a comparative study.  
AB  - In cardiology and research involving the interactions between restorative materials and dental hard tissues, it is important for small changes in tooth mineral content to be measurable. Currently, transverse microradiography (TMR) is the most accepted tool for the above purpose. Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) can yield both qualitative identification of elements and quantitative compositional information. The purpose of this study was to compare the mineral distribution in well-defined artificial lesions, in dentin and enamel, by the use of both TMR and EPMA on the same sample. The good correlation between the two sets of data validates EPMA as a technique and helps in the interpretation of its results. The data from TMR analysis are expressed as vol% of mineral, while EPMA gives the levels of Ca and phosphate in wt%. The conversion between the two sets of data is complicated by the fact that local density is, as yet, unknown.

AB  - Using autoimmune serum from a patient with anti-centromere antibodies, we have identified and partially characterized a novel protein with a mol. wt of approximately 27 kD (hereafter referred to as p27). A cDNA expression library was screened with this serum, and two overlapping inserts were isolated among three positive clones other than clones corresponding to centromere protein (CENP)-B and CENP-C. Analysis of the sequence showed an open reading frame of approximately 0.6 kb encoding 199 amino acids with a predicted mol. wt of 21.5 kD. Immunoblotting analysis with bacterial recombinant p27 showed that approximately 2% of anti-centromere antibody-positive patients had autoantibodies to p27, whereas only one of 215 autoimmune patients without anti-centromere antibodies reacted with the recombinant. All five cases with anti-p27 antibodies, who were diagnosed as having scleroderma and/or Sjogren's syndrome, showed internal organ involvement. Although affinity-purified anti-p27 human or mouse polyclonal antibodies failed to stain any cellular structures in an immunofluorescence study, the potential association of anti-p27 with anti-centromere antibodies suggests that this novel autoantigen might play a role in mitosis.

TI  - Requirements for p53 and the ATM gene product in the regulation of G1/S and S phase checkpoints.  
AB  - We investigated the requirements for protein p53 and the ATM gene product in radiation-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and regulation of the cyclin E/ and cyclin A/cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). Wild type (WT) mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs), p53(-/-) knock-out MLFs, normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF-55), and human AT skin fibroblasts (GM02052) were used in the investigations. The absence of p53 had no significant effect on the inhibition or recovery of DNA synthesis throughout the S phase, as determined from BrdU labeling and flow cytometry, or the rapid inhibition of cyclin A/Cdks. Gamma radiation (8 Gy) inhibited DNA synthesis and progression into G2 during the first 3 h after irradiation, and the recovery of these processes occurred at similar rates in both WT and p53(-/-) MLFs. The cyclin A/Cdks were inhibited 55-70% at 1 h after irradiation in both cell types, but p21WAF1/Cip1 levels or p21 interaction with Cdk2 did not increase in the irradiated p53(-/-) MLFs. Although p53(-/-) MLFs do not exhibit prolonged arrest at a G1 checkpoint, radiation did induce a rapid 20% reduction and small super-recovery of cyclin E/Cdk2 within 1-2 h after irradiation. Similar inhibition and recovery of cyclin E/Cdk2 previously had been associated with regulation of transient G1 delay and the inhibition of initiation at an apparent G1/S checkpoint in Chinese hamster cells. In contrast, loss of the ATM gene product abrogated transient cyclin E/Cdk2 inhibition, most inhibition of DNA synthesis and all, but a 10-15% inhibition, of the cyclin A/Cdks. The results indicate that neither p53 nor p21 is required for transient inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 associated with the G1/S checkpoint or for inhibition of DNA synthesis at 'checkpoints' within the S phase. Conversely, the ATM gene product appears to be essential for regulation of the G1/S checkpoint and for inhibition of DNA replication associated with the inhibition of cyclin A/Cdk2. Differential aspects of DNA synthesis inhibition among cell types are presented and discussed in the context of S phase checkpoints.

TI  - Pancreatic enhancement and pulse sequence analysis using low-dose mangafodipir trisodium.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pancreatic enhancement with low-dose mangafodipir trisodium (5 mumol/kg) using three different T1-weighted pulse sequences. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients, six of whom had proven focal pancreatic tumors, underwent T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo imaging, spin-echo imaging, and fat-suppressed spin-echo imaging before and 30 min after injection of 5 mumol/kg of mangafodipir trisodium. Region-of-interest measurements were obtained in the pancreas before and after contrast enhancement. Signal-to-noise ratios were calculated in all 15 patients. Contrast-to-noise ratios were calculated in the six patients with pancreatic tumors. RESULTS: The signal-to-noise ratios of the pancreas increased after injection of mangafodipir trisodium on all three T1-weighted pulse sequences (p < .001). Enhanced fat-suppressed sequences (29 +/- 7.7) and gradient-recalled echo sequences (29 +/- 9.6) had the highest signal-to-noise ratios. Contrast-to-noise ratios between normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic tumor also increased after contrast administration (p < .05) and were highest on the fat-suppressed (-9.6 +/- 4.0) pulse sequence. CONCLUSION: Mangafodipir trisodium produced marked pancreatic enhancement at a dose of 5 mumol/kg for all three T1-weighted pulse sequences. The enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo fat-suppressed sequence showed the highest signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios.

TI  - Effects of epidermal growth factor, cholecystokinin, and secretin on growth of the alimentary tract in the neonatal guinea pig.  
AB  - Gut hormones and growth factors are likely to be involved in the functional changes and substantial growth of the alimentary tract that occurs during early neonatal life. The present experiments investigated the effects of continuous subcutaneous infusion of cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in neonatal guinea pigs for 4 or 15 days. At doses of 20, 100 or 500 pmol/kg/h, CCK and secretin had no effect on alimentary tract organs except for an increase in pancreatic weight at 4 days with the highest dose of CCK and an increase in stomach weight at 4 days with the highest dose of secretin. In contrast, EGF showed dose-dependent and time-dependent effects on all the alimentary tract organs when infused at 70, 210 and 630 pmol/kg/h. These results suggest that EGF, but not CCK or secretin, is likely to be an important trophic factor during the neonatal period.

TI  - Enteral nutrition for patients with cystic fibrosis: comparison of a semi-elemental and nonelemental formula.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differences in tolerance and absorption of fat and nitrogen exist between a semi-elemental nutritional formula without enzyme replacement and a nonelemental formula with enzyme replacement. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen patients (eight girls and eight boys) with cystic fibrosis, 4 to 20 years of age (12+/-1.3, mean +/- SEM), who were pancreatic insufficient completed two 6-day regimens of nocturnal continuous enteral feedings offered in random order. Forty-four percent of the total daily energy was consumed as enteral tube feedings, and the remaining oral dietary intake remained constant throughout the study. Seventy-two-hour fecal collections from each study period were analyzed for total fat, long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), and nitrogen. RESULTS: Fat absorption was 80.2%+/-2.9% and 82.3%+/-3.1% (p = 0.58) for the semi-elemental and nonelemental formulas, respectively. Similarly, the coefficient of absorption of LCFAs was 69.5%+/-4.5% and 79.6%+/-3.4% (p = 0.30) for the semi-elemental and nonelemental formulas. Malabsorption of MCFAs contributed minimally to total fat malabsorption. There was no difference between formulas for MCFA or for nitrogen absorption, 83.7%+/-1.9% and 87.4%+/-1.4%, p = 0.48. All patients tolerated all feedings, and weight gained was 1.8+/-0.3 kg with no difference in weight gain between the trials. CONCLUSION: A nonelemental formula, with enzyme replacement, is absorbed as well as a predigested formula in patients with CF who are pancreatic insufficient.

TI  - Information content of individual genetic sequences.  
AB  - Related genetic sequences having a common function can be described by Shannon's information measure and depicted graphically by a sequence logo. Though useful for many purposes, sequence logos only show the average sequence conservation, and inferring the conservation for individual sequences is difficult. This limitation is overcome by the individual information ( R i) technique described here. The method begins by generating a weight matrix from the frequencies of each nucleotide or amino acid at each position of the aligned sequences. This matrix is then applied to the sequences themselves to determine the sequence conservation of each individual sequence. The matrix is unique because the average of these assignments is the total sequence conservation, ad there is only one way to construct such a matrix. For binding sites on polynucleotides, the weight matrix has a natural cut off that distinguishes functional sequences from other sequences. R i values are on an absolute scale measured in bits of information so the conservation of different biological functions can be compared with one another. The matrix can be used to rank-order the sequences, to search for new sequences, to compare sequences to other quantitative data such as binding energy or distance between binding sites, to distinguish mutations from polymorphisms, to design sequences of a given strength, and to detect errors in databases. The R i method has been used to identify previously undescribed but experimentally verified DNA binding sites. The individual information distribution was determined for E. coli ribosome binding sites, bacterial Fis binding sites, and human donor and acceptor splice junctions, among others. The distributions demonstrate clearly that the consensus sequence is highly unusual, and hence is a poor method to describe naturally occurring binding sites. Copyright 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - [Body image disturbance in anorexia nervosa]  
AB  - 30 girls aged 13-19, who met DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa, and control group were investigated by using: 1. semistructured interview with subjects and their mothers about the pubertal status, history of marked overweight and the teasing about weight, the discrepancy between actual and ideal body weight, 2. a specially prepared questionnaire aimed to establish onset of body image disturbances, and the connection with above-mentioned symptoms and life events and lowered self-esteem, 3. Hamilton Anxiety Scale and 4. subscale from the Eating Disorders Inventory--Body Dissatisfaction Scale. Body image disturbances were characterized for anorectic persons with low global self-esteem and high level of anxiety, and developed during the change of the peer group or a change of the patient's position within the peer group.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy does not correct hypertension in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.  
AB  - Both hypertension and secondary hyperparathyroidism (2 degrees HPT) are common features of the uremic syndrome. It has been suggested that 2 degrees HPT causes hypertension in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We compared predialysis blood pressure (BP), weight and dose of antihypertensive medications (AHM) prescribed in 19 hemodialysis patients 1 month before total parathyroidectomy (PTx), during the first month after PTx, and long-term (mean 16 months) in 12 of 19 patients. At the time of PTx, study patients had a mean age of 47 +/- 9 years, mean duration of ESRD was 112 +/- 57 months, and mean intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 1,181 +/- 552 pg/ml. Mean BP and predialysis weight were equivalent during the month before and the month after PTx. Of 12 patients followed long term, 8 (67%) were receiving AHM before PTx; after PTx; 3 (36%) of 8 discontinued AHM within 1 year, 2 (25%) of 8 required more AHM, while 2 (25%) of 8 continued on their original AHM, and 1 patient who was not on AHM prior to PTx required initiation of AHM after PTx. There was a clinically significant increase in predialysis weight at 1 year after PTx (median 13 lb) and over time (r = 0.7; slope = 0.5; p = 0.07). However, there was neither a clinically nor statistically significant change in either systolic (r = -0.18; slope = -0.01; p = 0.61) or diastolic (r = -0.6; slope = -0.24; p = 0.12) BP over time. We conclude that PTx fails to correct hypertension in hemodialysis patients with 2 degrees HPT.

TI  - Characterization of hepatic lesions by perfusion-weighted MR imaging with an echoplanar sequence.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of perfusion-weighted MR imaging with a single-shot gradient echoplanar sequence in characterizing hepatic tumors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Perfusion-weighted imaging was performed in 61 patients with 91 confirmed hepatic tumors (14 hemangiomas, 19 metastases, and 58 hepatocellular carcinomas). The perfusion-weighted imaging was started at the time of administration of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium, and images were continuously obtained every 2 sec for 88 sec. Time-intensity curves for all the tumors were created for quantitative analysis. Patterns of enhancement were also evaluated. RESULTS: Changes in signal intensity that occurred throughout examination differed in three types of tumor. Transient signal intensity decreases in the perfusion phase significantly differed in three types of tumors (46% in hepatocellular carcinoma, 48% in hemangioma, and 15% in metastasis, p < .05 for hepatocellular carcinoma versus metastasis and for hemangioma versus metastasis). Signal intensity recovered rapidly for hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis, whereas recovery was slower for hemangioma. Final signal intensity recovery was 94% in hepatocellular carcinoma, 91% in metastasis, and 54% in hemangioma compared with their initial signal intensities. (p < .05 for hepatocellular carcinoma versus hemangioma and for hemangioma versus metastasis.) The enhancement patterns also differed in three types of tumor. CONCLUSION: Perfusion-weighted imaging with a gradient echoplanar sequence provides real-time mapping of many points along the enhancement profile curves because of its excellent temporal resolution. Therefore, it accurately characterizes hepatic tumors based on their different negative-enhancement patterns.

TI  - The relative weighting of acoustic properties in the perception of [s] + stop clusters by children and adults.  
AB  - We examined the perceptual weighting by children and adults of the acoustic properties specifying complete closure of the vocal tract following a syllable-initial [s]. Experiment 1 was a novel manipulation of previously examined acoustic properties (duration of a silent gap and first formant transition) and showed that children weight the first formant transition more than adults. Experiment 2, an acoustic analysis of naturally produced say and stay, revealed that, contrary to expectations, a burst can be present in stay and that first formant transitions do not necessarily distinguish say and stay in natural tokens. Experiment 3 manipulated natural speech portions to create stimuli that varied primarily in the duration of the silent gap and in the presence or absence of a stop burst, and showed that children weight these stop bursts less than adults. Taken together, the perception experiments support claims that children integrate multiple acoustic properties as adults do, but that they weight dynamic properties of the signal more than adults and weight static properties less.

TI  - Effect of 4-acryloxyethyltrimellitic acid in a self-etching primer on bonding to ground dentin.  
AB  - To develop a self-etching primer for ground dentin, 4-acryloxyethyltrimellitic acid (4-AET) was newly synthesized, and the effect of concentrations varying from 0 (control) to 56.5 wt% 4-AET in the water/ HEMA primer on bonding to the dentin was investigated. Bond strength to the dentin was significantly affected by the inclusion of 4-AET in the primer which also contained N,N-di(hydroxyethyl)-p-toluidine (DEPT) when compared with the control (0% 4-AET) (p < 0.01). The optimum 4-AET-concentration and the mean bond strength (SD) were found to be 6.5 wt%: 24.2 (3.6 MPa, 37.4 wt%: 25.3 (4.4) MPa, 47.2 wt%: 26.9 (11.6) MPa and 54.4 wt%: 29.7 (12.9) MPa. The role of DEPT in the 4-AET/HEMA primer was assessed, and the optimum DEPT-concentration was found to be 0.154 and 0.307 mol%. Regarding the hypothetical bonding mechanism to dentin, it was thought that the ionized 4-AET in water/HEMA would penetrate into dentin substrates, and DEPT as an accelerator in situ would facilitate photo-polymerization at the dentin-resin interface, and result in increased bond strength to ground dentin.

TI  - Demonstration of in-situ apoptosis in mouse liver and kidney after short-term repeated exposure to fumonisin B1.  
AB  - Fumonisin B1, a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium moniliforme, inhibits the activity of ceramide synthetase, the key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, leading to accumulation ofsphinganine and sphingosine. Ceramide and other sphingolipid pathways have been implicated in signal-induced apoptosis in cells. Groups of male BALB/c mice received subcutaneous injections (0, 0.25, 0.75, 2.25 or 6.25 mg/kg) of fumonisin B1 daily for 5 days and the liver and kidneys were sampled 1 day after the last injection. A decrease in kidney weight was observed after fumonisin treatment. A "blind" random evaluation of stained sections revealed dose-dependent fumonisin B1-associated hepatic and renal lesions in all groups. Terminal uridine triphosphate (UTP) nick-end labelling (TUNEL) in liver and kidney sections confirmed the presence of dose-related apoptotic cells at all treatment levels. Thus fumonisin B1 produced apoptosis after a brief exposure to relatively low doses. The toxicity of fumonisin B1 was greater than that previously found in studies on oral toxicity.

TI  - MR-microscopic visualization of anisotropic internal cartilage structures using the magic angle technique.  
AB  - NMR microscopic studies of articular cartilage at 7.1 T are presented. Using a special experimental design, T2-weighted spin-echo images of cartilage-bone plugs were taken under variable angles with respect to the static magnetic field B0 to visualize the angular-dependent representation of internal matrix structures mediated by the collagen network arrangement. To quantify the observed orientational effect in the MR images, exact measurements of the transverse relaxation time T2 were taken using the CPMG sequence. The NMR experiments show the strong influence of the cartilage orientation with respect to the static magnetic field on the inhomogeneous appearance of the articular cartilage in the MR image. Additionally performed polarization light microscopic investigations demonstrate the direct relation between the oriented collagenous structures and the anisotropic regions observed in the MR images. A simple cartilage matrix model derived from the experimental findings is proposed, and consequences for the clinical assessment of the articular joint are discussed.

TI  - L-arginine prevents lung neutrophil accumulation and preserves pulmonary endothelial function after endotoxin.  
AB  - L-Arginine supplementation has been shown to restore endothelium-derived nitric oxide production in several pathological states. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of administration of exogenous L-arginine on the endotoxin-induced lung neutrophil accumulation and impairment of endothelium-dependent guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated pulmonary vasorelaxation in rats. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was tested by receptor-dependent [acetylcholine (ACh)] and receptor-independent (A-23187) pathways. Endothelium-independent relaxation was tested with sodium nitroprusside (SNP). In isolated pulmonary arterial rings, concentration-response curves were generated with ACh, A-23187, and SNP (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) 4 h after endotoxin (500 micrograms/kg i.p.) with and without prior administration of L-arginine (300 mg/kg i.p.). Lung neutrophil accumulation was determined by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. After endotoxin, lung neutrophil accumulation was significantly increased (MPO activity, 3.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1 units/g lung weight in control cells; P < 0.05), which was prevented by L-arginine treatment (MPO activity, 1.3 +/- 0.3 units/g lung weight; P < 0.05 vs. endotoxin). Endotoxin produced a significant impairment of endothelium-dependent cGMP-mediated pulmonary vasorelaxation by receptor-dependent (ACh) and -independent (A-23187) pathways as well as of endothelium-independent relaxation (SNP). Prior treatment with L-arginine, but not with D-arginine, preserved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Neither L- nor D-arginine influenced endotoxin-induced impairment of endothelium-independent, cGMP-mediated pulmonary vasorelaxation. We conclude that administration of exogenous L-arginine prevents endotoxin-induced lung neutrophil accumulation and attenuates its associated impairment of endothelium-dependent, cGMP-mediated pulmonary vasorelaxation.

TI  - Differences in resting metabolic rates of inactive obese African-American and Caucasian women.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare resting metabolic rates (RMR) of African-American (n = 25) and Caucasian (n = 22) premenopausal (35+/-1 y, Mean +/- s.e.m.) women who are obese (95.2+/-2.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) = 34.7+/-0.9, % body fat = 45.2+/-0.9), inactive and free from metabolic disorders or medications that would affect heart rate or RMR. MEASUREMENTS: RMR and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) by indirect calorimetry, body composition by plethysmography, maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) and girth measurements. RESULTS: Group mean comparisons were made with a Student's t-test or an ANCOVA, which controlled for individual differences in body weight and lean body mass (LBM). Significance was set at P < 0.05. Groups were not significantly different in age, height, weight, BMI, % body fat, fat mass, RER, VO2max, resting heart rate, maximal heart rate; or chest, waist, hip, arm, thigh or calf circumferences. After adjusting for body weight, RMR (I O2/min) for African-Americans (0.254+/-0.007) was significantly lower (9%) than for Caucasians (0.277+/-0.008). After RMR (I O2/min) was adjusted for LBM, an even larger difference (-12%) persisted for African-Americans (0.250+/-0.008) compared to Caucasians (0.281+/-0.008). Predicted RMR (kJ/d) for the African-Americans was the same as measured RMR, whereas Caucasian women expended about 13% more energy than predicted. When controlling for LBM, the partial correlation between VO2max and RMR was r=0.51 when VO2max was expressed as I/min, and r=0.56 when VO2max was expressed as ml O2/kg/min, both highly significant (P < 0.000). CONCLUSION: The lower prevalence of obesity in Caucasian women may be due in part to a higher RMR as well as an under estimation of RMR in weight control therapy. Fitness level (VO2max) as well as LBM are significant predictors of RMR for both races.

TI  - Comparison of debris extruded apically in straight canals: conventional filing versus profile .04 Taper series 29.  
AB  - The purposes of this study were to determine quantitatively the amount of debris and irrigant forced in an apical direction, the frequency of apical plug development, and the time required to prepare canals when a step-back technique using K-files was compared with the .04 Taper system. Sixty-nine extracted teeth with straight canals were divided into four statistically similar groups. Two groups were instrumented either 1 mm short of the apical foramen or to the apical foramen with K-files. The other two groups were instrumented to the same levels using .04 Taper files. The extruded debris and irrigant were collected in preweighed vials.  The weight of the debris and volume of irrigant extruded using both techniques were compared and analyzed using paired t test and one-way ANOVA. Tukey's Multiple Comparisons Procedure showed K-files used to the apical foramen extruded significantly more debris than the other three groups (p < 0.01). The .04 Taper files used 1 mm short extruded less debris than the other groups. Significantly more irrigant was extruded when filing was performed to the apical foramen (p < 0.007), regardless of the technique used. More apical plugs were created in teeth filed short of the apical foramen, but the difference between the two preparation techniques was not statistically significant. It took significantly less time to instrument canals with the .04 Taper system than with K-files (p < 0.002).

TI  - Turbo spin-echo diffusion-weighted MR of ischemic stroke [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: Our objective was to determine whether a multisection technique, diffusion-weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) imaging, can compensate for the drawbacks common to other diffusion-weighted techniques; specifically, the need for echo-planar technology and the presence of susceptibility artifacts in areas close to the skull base. METHODS: Forty subjects who were referred to the stroke service with signs of acute (less than 24 hour) neurologic dysfunction were included in this prospective study. MR imaging of the brain was performed with diffusion-weighted echo-planar and diffusion-weighted HASTE sequences. The images obtained with both sequences were analyzed for the presence of hyperintensities corresponding to ischemic lesions as well as for the presence of image artifacts and distortions. RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted HASTE images showed areas of hyperintensity corresponding to the infarcts present on diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging studies without distortion or susceptibility artifacts in all the patients who had a stroke. Twelve patients had no acute ischemic lesions; of these, five had other findings, six had normal findings, and in one patient, a hyperintensity seen on diffusion-weighted echo-planar images proved to be an artifact on diffusion-weighted HASTE images. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-weighted HASTE is equal to diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging in the detection of early ischemia. Because of the absence of significant image distortions and other artifacts, diffusion-weighted HASTE permits fast multiplanar imaging in artifact-prone regions, such as the posterior fossa and the inferior frontal and temporal lobes. Diffusion imaging can be performed on conventional systems with strengths of 1.5 T that do not have echo-planar imaging capabilities.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare high-resolution contrast-enhanced (Gd-DTPA) dynamic MR imaging with T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) imaging in the evaluation of uterine cervical carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with cervical carcinoma underwent MR imaging on a 1.5 T superconductive unit to have the extension of the disease assessed before treatment. A phased-array coil was used in all patients. In 25 patients, surgical confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained after imaging. Radiation therapy was selected for the remaining 7 patients with advanced carcinoma. Qualitative and quantitative image analyses were also performed. RESULTS: The cervical carcinomas showed maximum contrast in the cervical stroma and myometrium in the early dynamic phase. The tumor/cervical-stroma contrast in the early dynamic phase obtained with the T1-weighted TSE technique (contrast-to-noise ratio 22.6) was significantly higher than that obtained in T2-weighted TSE imaging (contrast-to-noise ratio 4.3). In the evaluation of parametrial invasion, the accuracy of T2-weighted imaging was 71.8% and contrast-enhanced dynamic imaging 81.2%. CONCLUSION: High-resolution contrast-enhanced (Gd-DTPA) dynamic MR imaging in cervical cancer offers improved tumor/cervical-stroma contrast and provides useful information on parametrial invasion.

TI  - Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid status and early growth of low birth weight infants.  
AB  - We correlated arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status with anthropometric measures and growth rates in a group of low birth weight infants (< or = 2500 g; gestational ages 30-41 weeks; n = 143). AA and DHA status were measured in erythrocytes (RBC) and plasma cholesterol esters (CE) during days 10 to 42. Infants received preterm formula without long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP; n = 81), with LCP (n = 29) or maternal milk (n = 33). RBC AA contents on day 10 were correlated (P < 0.05) with birth weight in breast-fed infants and all formula-fed infants, with on day 10 a standard deviation score (SDS) for weight, length and occipito-frontal circumference in all formula-fed infants, and with on day 10 an SDS for length in breast-fed infants.  Brain weight was related to RBC DHA and CE DHA contents on both day 10 and day 42 in formula-fed infants. Of the variances of brain growth parameters on day 42, 21-34% were explained by DHA status on day 42 and protein intake from days 10-42. CONCLUSION: We conclude that parameters of early neonatal AA status are related to intra-uterine rather than to post-natal growth. Parameters of post-natal brain growth are related to RBC DHA and CE DHA contents on day 42, and to dietary protein intake. These results point to the importance of dietary DHA for brain growth in the first 6 post-natal weeks.

TI  - Calcitonin gene-related peptide and spinal afferents partly mediate postoperative colonic ileus in the rat.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a widely distributed neuropeptide contained in intrinsic and extrinsic neurons of the gastrointestinal wall that has been shown to be released by noxious stimulation, to be involved in nociception, to inhibit gastrointestinal motility, and to partly mediate postoperative gastric ileus. We hypothesized that abdominal surgery-induced release of CGRP might inhibit postoperative colonic motility and food intake. METHODS: Colonic transit, stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake were measured for 48 hours after induction of postoperative ileus in rats. CGRP was immunoneutralized by preoperative injection of CGRP monoclonal antibody, or visceral afferent nerve fibers containing CGRP were functionally ablated by topical capsaicin treatment of the vagus nerves or of the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia before abdominal surgery. RESULTS: Abdominal surgery increased colonic transit time and decreased 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake. CGRP immunoneutralization reversed postoperative inhibition of colonic transit, 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake by 77%, 82%, 80%, and 52%, respectively. Whereas ablation of vagal afferent nerve fibers had no effect, spinal afferent nerve fiber ablation reversed postoperative inhibition of 24-hour cumulative stool pellet number, stool pellet weight, and food intake by 41%, 38%, and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CGRP and spinal afferent nerve fibers partly mediate postoperative colonic ileus and inhibition of food intake in the rat. By the magnitude of reversal of postoperative ileus, CGRP seems to be an important mediator of postoperative colonic ileus. Our results for the first time show involvement of a neuropeptide and spinal afferents in the mediation of postoperative colonic ileus and postoperative inhibition of food intake in rats.

TI  - Adequate clinical control of congenital nephrotic syndrome by enalapril.  
AB  - The combination of captopril and indomethacin has been shown to control nephrotic proteinuria in an infant with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. We report the satisfactory control of congenital nephrotic syndrome by enalapril, maintaining normal serum albumin levels without albumin infusions. The haplotype data of our patient were consistent with the diagnosis of a Finnish-type nephrotic syndrome. After 21 months, during which daily infusions of albumin allowed partial control of the symptoms, captopril treatment was started. No adverse effects were noted. Serum creatinine levels remained normal. Within 8 weeks, albumin infusions were completely stopped. After 1 month the treatment was changed to a single dose of enalapril (0.8 mg/kg per day). During the next 15 months, the serum protein concentration was maintained around 6.5-7 g/dl, although proteinuria persisted (0.3-0.5 g/day).  Weight and length gain are now satisfactory. We conclude that enalapril may be safely used in infants with severe forms of congenital nephrotic syndrome and might allow the avoidance of aggressive treatments for prolonged periods.

TI  - Effect of age on furosemide-induced nephrocalcinosis in the rat.  
AB  - Furosemide (F)-induced nephrocalcinosis (NC) has been traditionally described in low birth weight premature infants. To investigate the role of age on F-induced nephrocalcinosis we studied 24 Sprague-Dawley male rats grouped by age and F therapy vs. control as follows: A (4-week-old control), B (4-week-old + F), C (6-week-old control), D (6-week-old + F), E (10-week-old control), F (10-week-old + F). The rats were placed in metabolic cages for measurement of urine output, food and water intake. At day 14 they were anesthetized, exsanguinated and their kidneys harvested. Renal calcium deposition was assessed using NC score (scale 0-4) and quantitative calcium analysis in the contralateral kidney. Treated animals gained less weight and had higher urine output and fluid intake than the age-matched controls demonstrating the diuretic effect of furosemide. Control groups A, C, and E scored 0 histologically compared with B 2.75 +/- 0.50, D 2.00 +/- 0.58, and F 3.00 +/- 0.82 (p < 0.05 in all three paired groups). Kidney calcium content (micrograms/g dry weight) in B was 2,815.68 +/- 1,553.77 vs. A 202.58 +/- 32.02 (p = 0.04); D 1,574.05 +/- 540.21 vs. C 212.22 +/- 30.91 (p = 0.02); F 2,591.40 +/- 1,269.80 vs. E 210.38 +/- 26.79 (p = 0.02). There was no difference in the magnitude of NC among the three treated groups themselves. To determine the possible effect of age on timing of onset of NC additional 30 4-week-old and 30 10-week-old rats were studied. All 60 rats received furosemide. Six rats from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 11. In both groups, significant calcifications were seen already on day 3 and maximum calcification noted between days 3 and 5. We conclude that in this model the development of NC occurs within a few days of furosemide administration and that this phenomenon is not age dependent but rather reflects a property of the loop diuretic itself.

TI  - Calciotropic hormones and bone markers in the elderly.  
AB  - There is a lack of substantial data on changes in calciotropic hormones and bone markers in elderly subjects living in North America. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and bone markers (serum osteocalcin and urine N-telopeptide), were measured in 735 Caucasian subjects (235 men and 500 women) aged 65-87 years. There was a significant increase in serum osteocalcin and urine N-telopeptide with age in men, and a significant increase in serum osteocalcin with age in women. Serum PTH and 25(OH)D showed no significant change with age in men or women. After adjusting for age, calcium intake, serum creatinine, season, and weight, mean serum PTH (p = 0.01), serum osteocalcin (p = 0.0001) and 24 h urine N-telopeptide (p = 0.0001) were higher in women than men, and mean serum 25(OH)D (p = 0.0001) and 24 h urine calcium (p = 0.0001) were higher in men than women. Serum PTH was correlated with serum osteocalcin in men and women, r = 0.24, r = 0.17, p < 0.001, but not with urine N-telopeptide. Serum PTH was inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D (r = -0.25, r = -034,p < 0.001), and positively correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.14, r = 0.17,p < 0.01) in men and women. The prevalence of serum 25(OH)D levels below 12 ng/ml was only 33% in females and 0.4% in men. Thus vitamin D deficiency was very uncommon in the U.S.A. compared with Europe. Although mean serum PTH was increased in the elderly, only 4-6% had PTH levels above the normal range. In summary, the increase in serum PTH in the elderly can be explained more by changes in vitamin D status than by declining renal function. These data also show significantly higher (p = 0.001) bone remodeling markers in women.

TI  - Quantification of muscarinic cholinergic receptors with [11C]NMPB and positron emission tomography: method development and differentiation of tracer delivery from receptor binding.  
AB  - Quantification of human brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors was investigated with the use of [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzylate (NMPB) and positron emission tomography (PET). Whole-brain uptake of NMPB at 90 to 110 minutes after intravenous injection was approximately 10% of the administered dose. The initial cerebral distribution of NMPB corresponded to the pattern of cerebral perfusion; however, at progressively longer postinjection intervals, regional distinctions consistent with muscarinic receptor binding were evident: activity at 90 to 110 minutes postinjection was highest in the striatum and cerebral cortex, intermediate in the thalamus and pons, and lowest in the cerebellum. After the development of a chromatographic system for isolation of authentic [11C]NMPB in plasma, tracer kinetic modeling was used to estimate receptor binding from the cerebral and arterial plasma tracer time-courses. Ligand transport rate and receptor-binding estimates were obtained with the use of compartmental models and analytical methods of varying complexity, including a two-parameter pixel-by-pixel-weighted integral approach and regional least-squares curve-fitting analyses employing both two- and three-compartment model configurations. In test-retest experiments, precision of the methods and their abilities to distinguish altered ligand delivery from binding in occipital cortex during an audiovisual presentation were evaluated. Visual stimulation increased the occipital blood-to-brain NMPB transport rate by 25% to 46% in estimates arising from the various approaches. Weighted integral analyses resulted in lowest apparent transport changes and in a concomitant trend toward apparent binding increases during visual activation. The regional least-squares procedures were superior to the pixel-by-pixel method in isolating the effects of altered tracer delivery from receptor-binding estimates, indicating larger transport effects and unaltered binding. Precision was best (less than 10% test-retest differences) for the weighted integral analyses and was somewhat lower in the least-squares analyses (10-25% differences). The authors conclude that pixel-by-pixel-weighted integral analyses of NMPB distribution introduce transport biases into receptor-binding estimates. Similar confounding effects also are predicted in noncompartmental analyses of delayed radiotracer distribution. The use of regional nonlinear least-squares fitting to two- and three-compartment models, although more labor intensive, provides accurate distinction of receptor-binding estimates from tracer delivery with acceptable precision in both intra- and intersubject comparisons.

TI  - Dibasic protein kinase A sites regulate bursting rate and nucleotide sensitivity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel.  
AB  - 1. The relationship between phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and its gating by nucleotides was examined using the patch clamp technique by comparing strongly phosphorylated wild-type (WT) channels with weakly phosphorylated mutant channels lacking four (4SA) or all ten (10SA) dibasic consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). 2. The open probability (Po) of strongly phosphorylated WT channels in excised patches was about twice that of 4SA and 10SA channels, after correcting for the number of functional channels per patch by addition of adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). The mean burst durations of WT and mutant channels were similar, and therefore the elevated Po of WT was due to its higher bursting rate. 3. The ATP dependence of the 10SA mutant was shifted to higher nucleotide concentrations compared with WT channels. The relationship between Po and [ATP] was noticeably sigmoid for 10SA channels (Hill coefficient, 1.8), consistent with positive co-operativity between two sites. Increasing ATP concentration to 10 mM caused the Po of both WT and 10SA channels to decline. 4. Wild-type and mutant CFTR channels became locked in open bursts when exposed to mixtures of ATP and the non-hydrolysable analogue AMP-PNP. The rate at which the low phosphorylation mutants became locked open was about half that of WT channels, consistent with Po being the principal determinant of locking rate in WT and mutant channels. 5. We conclude that phosphorylation at 'weak' PKA sites is sufficient to sustain the interactions between the ATP binding domains that mediate locking by AMP-PNP. Phosphorylation of the strong dibasic PKA sites controls the bursting rate and Po of WT channels by increasing the apparent affinity of CFTR for ATP.

TI  - Parents as the exclusive agents of change in the treatment of childhood obesity.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive weight in childhood is a serious public health concern because of its costly health consequences and its increasing prevalence. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the efficacy of a family-based approach for the treatment of childhood obesity, in which the parents served as the exclusive agents of change, with that of the conventional approach, in which the children served as the agents of change. DESIGN: This study had a randomized, longitudinal prospective design and lasted 1 y. Sixty obese children aged 6-11 y were randomly allocated to the experimental (parents as agents of change) or control (children as agents of change) group. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were determined at the start and end of the study. A sociodemographic questionnaire and a family eating and activity habits questionnaire were completed by both parents. Hour-long support and educational sessions were conducted by a clinical dietitian: 14 sessions for the parents in the experimental group and 30 sessions for the children in the control group. RESULTS: The dropout rate was nine times greater in the control group (n = 9) than in the experimental group (n = 1). Mean percentile weight reduction was significantly (P < 0.03) higher in children in the experimental group (14.6%) than in the control group (8.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of childhood obesity with parents as the exclusive agents of change was superior to the conventional approach, as indicated by the dropout rate and the percentage weight loss of the children during the 1-y intervention.

Follow-up imaging at more than 170 days revealed isointensity to hypointensity on T1WI (96.2%) and reduced HI on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and Gd-DTPA T1WI. All lesions became less conspicuous and were reduced in volume. HCC shows time-related changes in signals and size after LMC. Identifying the irradiated lesion is necessary to estimate the adequacy of treatment by comparison with the pretherapeutic image.

TI  - Serum distemper virus and parvovirus antibody titers among dogs brought to a veterinary hospital for revaccination [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine serum canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) antibody titers in healthy dogs brought to a veterinary hospital for revaccination. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 122 dogs. PROCEDURE: Serum antibody titers were measured by means of hemagglutination inhibition (CPV titers) or serum neutralization (CDV titers) at the time dogs were brought to the hospital for revaccination. All dogs had been vaccinated between 271 and 1,665 days previously. Dogs were grouped by age, breed (purebred vs mixed breed), sex, and weight to determine whether these factors were associated with antibody titers. Serum CPV titers > or = 1:80 and serum CDV titers > or = 1:96 were considered protective. RESULTS: Breed, sex, and weight were not significantly associated with serum CPV and CDV titers. Age was significantly associated with CPV titer, with younger dogs having higher titers, but was not associated with CDV titer. Thirty-three of 122 (27%; 95% confidence interval, 19.0 to 34.9%) dogs had a less-than-protective CPV titer. Twenty-five of 117 (21%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6 to 28.4%) dogs had a less-than-protective CDV titer. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that, on the basis of serum antibody titers, the current practice of annual revaccination of dogs against CPV and CDV infection should be maintained. Measurement of antibody titers to determine whether revaccination is truly needed would seem justifiable in those dogs that have previously had an adverse reaction to vaccination.

TI  - Increases in body mass index and waist circumference as outcomes of working overtime.  
AB  - This epidemiologic study was undertaken to determine whether working overtime is associated with anthropometric indices and serum lipids, risk factors for obesity, in white-collar workers. Non-management white-collar male workers were eligible. Body weight and height, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured.  Weight, height and waist circumference data obtained 3 years previously were also used. Lifestyle information was obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Overtime hours correlated significantly with the 3-year change in body mass index (r = 0.206, p < 0.0017) and waist circumference (r = 0.218, p = 0.0091), but not with either the most recent anthropometric indices or serum lipids. Overtime hours were also intercorrelated (r = 0.436, p < 0.0001) with dinner time. The present study suggested that working overtime is associated with the increases in BMI and waist circumference over a 3-year period although the associations were weak. Additionally, eating habits of those with working overtime might reflect an intervening effect on the anthropometric changes.

TI  - Impact of season and discharge weight on complications and growth of Kangaroo Mother Care treated low birthweight infants in Mozambique.  
AB  - This study aimed to determine the impact of season and weight at discharge on growth rate and complications in low birthweight infants treated with Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in Maputo, Mozambique. The study population included 246 infants of birthweight < 2000 g. Follow-up until 2400 g was obtained in 64%. There were no seasonal differences in weight gain and the risk of complications of infants treated with KMC in hospital. During the cold season after discharge, the risk of serious complications, including death, was higher (risk ratio 1.96; p = 0.02) and more readmissions occurred (risk ratio 2.77; p = 0.04). We postulate that after discharge mothers are unable to comply with the kangaroo position at all hours of the day and that exposure to low ambient temperatures may explain the more frequent occurrence of complications in the cold season. The weight at discharge did not affect complications or growth rate. We conclude that the current policy to discharge infants when having gained weight on 3 consecutive days, regardless of the actual weight, or whether the weight at birth has been regained, is adequate. In the cold season particularly, more efforts may be needed to ensure compliance with kangaroo position after discharge and to educate mothers on early signs of complications such as bronchopneumonia to encourage timely care seeking. With this method, low birthweight infants can grow adequately.

We examine the use of profile alignment methods for rRNA alignment and try to optimize the choice of parameters and sequence weights. RESULTS: Using a large alignment of eukaryotic SSU rRNA sequences as a test case, we empirically compared the performance of various sequence weighting schemes over a range of gap penalties. We developed a new weighting scheme which gives most weight to the sequences in the profile that are most similar to the new sequence. We show that it gives the most accurate alignments when combined with a more traditional sequence weighting scheme.

TI  - [Prevention of intraoperative hypothermia in children]  
AB  - Children are very sensible to the occurrence of intraoperative hypothermia (HT) (core temperature < or = 36.0 degrees C) during general anaesthesia because their regulation capacity is less effective than in adults and due to a large skin-surface area compared with their body mass. We compared the efficacy of different heating devices to prevent HT in children during surgery. METHODS: With approval of the local ethics committee 50 children between one and seven years, scheduled for peripheral surgery lasting at least 2 hours were included in this study. Anaesthesia was standardized in all patients. Patients were randomly divided into 5 groups. In group 1, in addition to the usual cotton blankets, room temperature was elevated to 27-28 degrees C. In group 2, room temperature was maintained at 27-28 degrees C, and the patients were additionally wrapped into an aluminum blanket. In group 3, elevated room temperature was combined with a convective heating blanket. Patients in group 4 were warmed with an aluminum blanket, while the room temperature was maintained at 22 degrees C. In group 5, room temperature was maintained at 22 degrees C and patients were warmed with a convective heating device (Tab. 1). Room and core body temperature (tympanon membrane) were continuously measured. ANOVA and Fisher's exact Test (significance level: p < 0.05) were performed for the statistical analysis of the results. RESULTS: The demographic data of all 5 groups, the infused fluid volume and the anaesthetic technique were similar. There were no significant differences concerning age, height and weight of the pediatric patients (Tab. 2). The core temperature decreased by -1.7 degrees C in group 1. In group 4 core temperature decreased by -1.6 degrees C. Using a convective warming system in normal ambient temperature (group 5) core temperature increased by 0.2 degree C and was as effective in the prevention of HT as group 2. A significant increase in core temperature occurred in group 3 +0.7 degree C (Tab. 3 and Fig. 1). DISCUSSION: OR temperature seems to be a critical factor influencing heat loss. Increasing OR temperature and covering with cotton sheets was not effective in preventing the heat loss. Increasing room temperature in combination with aluminum sheets is one alternative to prevent HT. Our study shows that the use of a convective warming device prevents HT during a 2-hour surgery in young children even at a OR temperature of about 22 degrees C. In conclusion, in pediatric patients the use of a convective heating system proved to be an effective alternative to room heating.

TI  - Small renal cell carcinoma: MRI with pathologic correlation.  
AB  - The MRI features of small renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with histology in 24 patients. MRI features on both T1- and T2-weighted images were classified into hypointensity, isointensity, and hyperintensity. Each tumor was pathologically classified into four types: alveolar, papillary, tubular, and cystic. These findings were correlated with MR signal intensities. Alveolar tumors showed hypointensity to isointensity on T1-weighted image and isointensity to hyperintensity on T2-weighted image. In contrast, all papillary tumors showed hypointensity on T2-weighted image. Four of six tumors with hypointensity on T2-weighted image were caused by hemosiderin deposition, hemorrhage, and necrosis. However, there were two papillary RCCs that showed hypointensity on T2-weighted image despite no hemosiderin deposition and no hemorrhage. We conclude that papillary RCC is associated with T2-hypointense appearance as well as hemosiderin deposition, hemorrhage, and necrosis.

TI  - Treating achalasia: from whalebone to laparoscope.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pathophysiology and management of achalasia. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications located via MEDLINE using the search term esophageal achalasia (subheadings: complications, drug therapy, epidemiology, etiology, physiopathology, surgery, and therapy) published in English from 1966 to December 1997. STUDY SELECTION: Of 2632 citations identified, 4.5% were selected for inclusion by authors' blinded review of the abstracts. New developments in the understanding of achalasia or reports of therapeutic efficacy in either controlled trials or uncontrolled consecutive series involving 10 patients or more observed for a year or longer were reviewed in detail. DATA EXTRACTION: All 6 controlled therapeutic trials were included, and therapeutic efficacy in uncontrolled series was assessed by the authors extracting the patients with a good-to-excellent response from each study and calculating a pooled estimate of response rate with individual studies weighted proportionally to sample size. DATA SYNTHESIS: Achalasia results from irreversible destruction of esophageal myenteric plexus neurons causing aperistalsis and failed lower sphincter relaxation. The only therapies that adequately compensate for this dysfunction for a sustained time are pneumatic dilation and Heller myotomy. The single controlled trial comparing these treatments found surgery superior to dilation (95% vs 51% nearly complete symptom resolution, P<.01). In uncontrolled trials pneumatic dilation (weighted mean [SD]) is 72% (26%) effective vs 84% (20%) for Heller myotomy. The limitation of dilation is a 3% risk of perforation; thoracotomy morbidity has been the major limitation of myotomy. Surgical morbidity has been sharply reduced by laparoscopic techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Both pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are effective therapies for achalasia; laparoscopic Heller myotomy is emerging as the optimal surgical therapy.

TI  - Automated detection and characterization of multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MR images.  
AB  - In the present study an automatic algorithm for detection and contouring of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain magnetic resonance (MR) images is introduced. This algorithm automatically detects MS lesions in axial proton density, T2-weighted, gadolinium enhanced, and fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain MR images. Automated detection consists of three main stages: (1) detection and contouring of all hyperintense signal regions within the image; (2) partial elimination of false positive segments (defined herein as artifacts) by size, shape index, and anatomical location; (3) the use of an artificial neural paradigm (Back-Propagation) for final removal of artifacts by differentiating them from true MS lesions. The algorithm was applied to 45 images acquired from 14 MS patients. The algorithm's sensitivity was 0.87 and the specificity 0.96. In 34 images, 100% of the lesions were detected. The algorithm potentially may serve as a useful preprocessing tool for quantitative MS monitoring via magnetic resonance imaging.

TI  - Coccidioidomycosis in Brazil. A case report.  
AB  - Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic infection with a relatively limited geographic distribution: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and the southwest of the United States. In these countries, the endemic area is restricted to the semiarid desert like regions which are similar to the northeast of Brazil. CASE REPORT: The patient is a 32 year-old male, born in the state of Bahia (Northeast of Brazil) and has been living in Sao Paulo (Southeast) for 6 years. He was admitted at Hospital das Clinicas, at the Department of Pneumology in October 1996, with a 6 month history of progressive and productive cough, fever, malaise, chills, loss of weight, weakness and arthralgia in the small joints. Chest x-rays and computerized tomography disclosed an interstitial reticulonodular infiltrate with a cavity in the right upper lobe. The standard potassium hydroxide preparation of sputum and broncoalveolar lavage demonstrated the characteristic thickened wall spherules in various stages of development. Sabouraud dextrose agar, at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C showed growth of white and cottony aerial miceleium. The microscopic morphology disclosed branched hyphae characterized by thick walled, barrel shaped arthroconidia alternated with empty cells. The sorological studies with positive double immunodiffusion test, and also positive complement fixation test in 1/128 dilution confirmed the diagnosis. The patient has been treated with ketoconazole and presents a favorable clinical and radiological evolution.

TI  - Histochemical and ultrastructural modification of mucosal mast cell granules in parasitized mice lacking the beta-chymase, mouse mast cell protease-1.  
AB  - The soluble beta-chymases mouse mast cell protease-1 (mMCP-1) and rat mast cell protease-II are predominantly expressed by intestinal mucosal mast cells (IMMCs) and may promote mucosal epithelial permeability when released during intestinal allergic hypersensitivity responses. To study the function of these chymases, we generated mice with a homozygous null mutation of the mMCP-1 gene and investigated their response to infection with the intestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Whereas mMCP-2, -4, and -5 were transcribed normally, there was no transcription of the mMCP-1 gene in null (-/-) mice, nor was mature mMCP-1 protein detected in (-/-) jejunal mucosa. In contrast, levels of mMCP-1 in wild-type (+/+) jejunal mucosa increased 200- to 350-fold from 0.66 microg mMCP-1/g wet weight in uninfected mice to 129 and 229 microg/g wet weight on days 8 and 10 of infection, respectively. The kinetics of IMMC recruitment differed in -/- mice compared with +/+ controls on days 8 (P < 0.05) and 10 (P < 0.03) of infection. The IMMCs in infected -/- mice stained poorly, if at all, for esterase with naphthol AS-D chloroacetate compared with the intense staining observed in +/+ controls. Ultrastructurally, the prominent crystal intragranular structures that are found in intraepithelial +/+ IMMCs were absent from -/- IMMCs. These data show that disruption of the mMCP-1 gene leads to profound histochemical and ultrastructural changes in IMMC granules.

TI  - [Effect of microwaves over Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. inoculated into frozen minced meat]  
AB  - The efficacy of the microwave oven in the destruction of some pathogenic microorganisms inoculated into minced meat was studied. These were inoculated with Salmonella spp. or Staphylococcus aureus, freezed for 2-3 days at -4 degrees C and thawed, according to their weight, in an Amana microwave (24450 Hz). They were radiated at levels of 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% for periods of 15, 45, 60, 90 and 105 seconds. The rate of survival of each bacteria was determined according to the methodology described by Vanderzant and Splittstoesser, as well as the activity of the acid phosphate enzyme as cooking parameter. The microbiological analysis shows that, despite the cooking level used, the time required for the elimination of both bacteria is greater than the one in which the meat is considered enzymatically and organoleptically cooked.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of hereditary hemochromatosis patients who lack the C282Y mutation.  
AB  - Approximately 85% of patients with typical hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for the C282Y mutation (C282Y/C282Y) in the recently identified candidate gene for HH. However, some HH patients are instead homozygous for the wild-type allele (wt/wt) at this locus. These wt/wt patients may represent a phenotypically similar, but genotypically different, heritable trait, or may be unrecognized cases of secondary iron overload. The purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth analysis of the wt/wt HH patients identified in the original description of the HH gene, and to compare them with 62 patients from the same analysis who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Eighteen of the 21 wt/wt HH patients from the original study were assessed for 14 historical and laboratory variables, including previously unrecognized causes of secondary iron overload, the heritability of iron overload and liver disease, and other clinical characteristics. Ten of these 18 wt/wt HH patients (55.6%) were found to have previously unrecognized causes for secondary iron overload compared with 3 of 62 (4.8%) of the C282Y/C282Y patients (P < .001). The remaining 8 wt/wt patients had no recognizable etiology of secondary iron overload. None of the 18 wt/wt patients had a family history of iron overload or liver disease, compared with 58% of the C282Y/C282Y patients (P < .001). When compared with C282Y homozygotes, the 8 wt/wt patients without secondary iron overload had a higher presenting hepatic iron index (HII) (9.5 vs. 4.7; P = .01). We conclude that, in this series of patients, over half of the wt/wt HH patients possessed previously unrecognized causes of secondary iron overload, and therefore, may have been misdiagnoses. If these cases are excluded, the number of false-negative tests is decreased, and the sensitivity of the mutational analysis is increased. However, there is a subgroup of wt/wt patients who have typical hemochromatosis without an identifiable cause of secondary iron overload. These patients may have more severe iron loading than C282Y homozygotes.

TI  - [Capacity of weight-for-age and length-for-age to predict stunting at 3 years of age]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the capacity of two cut-off points of weight-for-age and length-for-age (-1 and -2 standard deviations) at different ages in the interval between birth and 30 months to predict stunting in three year old children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from a longitudinal study in Guatemala were used to evaluate the hypothesis that the capacity of cut-off values of weight-for-age and length-for-age to predict stunting at three years of age varies according to age. RESULTS: Length-for-age at -1 standard deviation (SD) of the WHO/NCHS mean reference values is a satisfactory prognostic indicator of stunting at three years of age during the first semester of life, while the same index at -2 SD is adequate after 9 months of age. Weight-for-age at -1 SD is a suitable indicator only at 9 months and at -2 SD the indicator is satisfactory between 15 and 24 months of age. CONCLUSION: The capacity to predict stunting at three years of age, for weight-for-age and length-for-age cut-off values varies according to age.

TI  - Protein kinase B/akt and rab5 mediate Ras activation of endocytosis.  
AB  - Transient expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras (Ras:V12) stimulates endocytosis. Using NIH3T3 cells expressing constitutively active protein kinase B/akt (PKB/akt) or kinase-dead PKB/akt, we show that PKB/akt mediates the stimulatory effect of Ras on endocytosis. Fluid phase endocytosis of horseradish peroxidase in cells expressing the constitutively active form of PKB/akt was elevated and insensitive to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. However, expression of dominant negative Rab5:N34 blocked endocytosis in cells expressing the constitutively active form of PKB/akt. Transient expression of either Rab5:wt or Rab5:L79, a GTPase deficient mutant of Rab5, in cells expressing constitutively activated PKB/akt further increased endocytic rate. However, in cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt, endocytic rate was not affected by transient expression of Rab5:wt. Rab5:L79, on the other hand, increased endocytosis in cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt. Similar results were obtained using an in vitro endosome fusion reconstitution assay with cytosol prepared from cells expressing the activated PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt. Both Rab5:wt and Rab5:L79 stimulated endosome fusion when assayed in cytosol containing the activated PKB/akt, whereas only Rab5:L79 activated fusion when the assay utilized cytosol from kinase-dead expressing cells. We conclude that Ras activation of endocytosis requires both PKB/akt and Rab5 and that active kinase is required for activation Rab5.

TI  - What prevents professional drivers from following physicians' cardiologic advice?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of published studies of the effects of cardiac counselling among professional drivers (PD). Aims of the study were: (1) to examine explanatory variables for two classical 'driver' risk factors - body mass index (BMI), and smoking - and to analyse the interrelations among smoking cessation, losing weight and work-related life changes; (2) to assess the effectiveness of risk factor counselling after 6 months, and (3) to gain insight into possible discrepancies between PD perception of needed changes and compliance with the physician's advice. METHODS: There were 4 groups of male PD: 13 with ischemic heart disease, 12 hypertensives, 10 borderline hypertensives and 34 normotensives. Baseline cardiovascular risk factors as well as occupational and behavioral data were assessed via questionnaire. The counselling was aimed at smoking cessation, weight loss and promoting leisure-time physical activity. Qualitative methods were used to assess PD perceptions about the work environment and health promotion. RESULTS: Baseline smoking intensity was best predicted by the total burden of occupational stress and number of smoking years. Baseline BMI was best predicted by long work hours behind the wheel, low availability of attachment outside work and low self-reported job strain. Self-initiated smoking cessation was best predicted by few smoking years, low coffee intake and admitting fear during driving. Physical activity was significantly increased after 6 months.  Losing weight was associated with: quitting or diminishing smoking and making other, work-related, life changes. None of the heavy smokers decreased their daily number of cigarettes after 6 months, although expressing the need to do so in self-generated statements. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to occupational stressors, mainly, long work hours and the concomitant denial of job strain, in combination with low availability of social attachment outside work, could contribute to maintenance of maladaptive behavior in PD. These findings could serve as a basis for designing standardized intervention trials and suggest that modification of the work environment, with participation of the drivers, is a needed component of such trials. Particular attention should be paid to the length and scheduling of work shifts.

The central region of the neurinomas showed a slightly high intensity area with a marginal low intensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI), whereas on T2-weighted images (T2WI), the central area of the tumor was very low intensity with a marginal high intensity area. After gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) injection, these areas were homogeneously enhanced in both cases. The deference in enhancement after Gd-DTPA injection reflected the distribution of cellularity and vessels in the tumor.

TI  - Beta-blockers may cause ultrafiltration failure in peritoneal dialysis patients [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate mechanisms of ultrafiltration failure (UFF) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with UFF during CAPD compared with cross-sectionally selected controls. SETTING: University peritoneal dialysis center. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with UFF during CAPD necessitating change to hemodialysis (n = 6) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (n = 1), or causing greatly increased need for high glucose-containing solutes, were compared with 18 CAPD patients without such problems. STATISTICS: Fisher's exact test, Student's independent t-test, univariate and multivariate correlation analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected prior to analyses. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the UFF patients than in the controls (p = 0.006, p = 0.028, p = 0.013). Beta-blockers were used by 12 of the UFF patients, but only 2/ 18 controls (p < 0.0001). There was no intergroup difference in number of women, patient age or weight, incidence of diabetes or previous peritonitis, duration of PD, serum levels of albumin, creatinine, iron, or ferritin, or dosage of erythropoietin. Correlation was found between the daily amount of glucose instilled into the abdomen and serum triglycerides (r = +0.72, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (r = +0.56, p = 0.008), and HbA1C (r =-0.41, p = 0.039). Many patients were high absorbers of dialysis glucose. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that beta-blockers may cause UFF, and that glucose and lipid metabolism differed between these patients and controls without UFF.

TI  - Problem dieting behaviors among young adolescents.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine dieting, eating and exercise behaviors, use of diet pills, and vomiting or use of laxatives to lose weight among younger adolescents. DESIGN: Analysis of data from a modified version of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey administered to middle school students in North Carolina in 1995. SETTING: Fifty-three randomly selected middle schools in North Carolina. SUBJECTS: Two thousand three hundred thirty-one students in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to questions regarding weight control practices, including vomiting or laxative use, dieting, exercise, or diet pill use. RESULTS: Of the students surveyed, 110 (9.7%) of the girls and 46 (4.0%) of the boys reported vomiting or using laxatives to lose weight. Among the girls, vomiting or laxative use was associated with feeling overweight, other weight loss practices, older age, being a poor student, smoking, eating more salads or vegetables, and eating more candy or other sweets (P< or =.01). A logistic regression model consisting of diet pill use, dieting to lose weight, lower academic achievement, and currently trying to lose weight correctly classified 92% of female students who had or had not vomited or used laxatives. Among boys, vomiting or laxative use was associated with feeling overweight, other weight loss practices, minority racial status, smoking, frequency of eating hamburgers or other high-fat meats, and frequency of eating french fries or potato chips (P< or =.01). A model consisting of diet pill use, minority race, dieting to lose weight, smoking, feeling overweight, and number of servings of hamburgers, hot dogs, or barbecue correctly classified 97% of the boys who had or had not vomited or used laxatives. CONCLUSION: Younger adolescents trying to lose weight engage in a variety of problem dieting and weight loss behaviors that can compromise health and may be associated with eating disorders.

AB  - A 53-year-old man sustained a 50 Hz, 60 kV electrical injury. The current flowed between his right hand and both feet. There was necrosis of the distal portion of the right forearm, and the fourth and fifth toes on the right foot. The skin on the amputated right upper extremity appeared normal except for an ulcer in the antecubital fossa and some blister scars. However, most of the muscles of the arm at the elbow were necrosed and partially replaced by fatty tissue or fibrosis. These necrotic areas corresponded to minimally increased signal intensities on T1-weighted MRI, and high signal intensities on T2-weighted images. MRI may be employed to predict amputation level after electrical injury.

TI  - Evaluation of residual cellularity and proliferation on preoperatively treated breast cancer: a comparison between image analysis and light microscopy analysis.  
AB  - Histopathology has been suggested as a reliable method for tumour reduction evaluation of preoperatively treated breast cancer. Immunocytochemistry can be used to enhance the visibility of residual tumour cellularity and in the evaluation of its proliferative activity. We compared Image Analysis (IA) with Light Microscopy Analysis (LMA) on sections of breast carcinomas treated with preoperative chemo- or chemo/radiotherapy in the evaluation of the Neoplastic Cell Density (NCD) (69 cases) and the Proliferation Index (PI) (35 cases). NCD was expressed as the immunoreactive area to cytokeratin over the total original neoplastic area and PI was expressed as the number of immunostained tumoural nuclei with MIB 1 MoAb over the total of tumoural nuclei. The intraobserver agreement and that between IA and LMA for both indices were estimated by the common (kappa(w)) and the jackknife weighted kappa statistic (kappa(w)). The extent of agreement of each considered category was also assessed by means of the category-specific kappa statistics (kappa(cs)). The intraobserver agreement within LMA for NCD and PI and that between IA and LMA for PI were both satisfactory. Upon evaluation of the NCD, the agreement between IA and LMA showed unsatisfactory results, especially when the ratio between the residual tumour cells and the background was critical.

TI  - Diverse effects of renal denervation on ventricular hypertrophy and blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.  
AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy that accompanies hypertension seems to be a phenomenon of multifactorial origin whose development does not seem to depend on an increased pressure load alone, but also on local growth factors and cardioadrenergic activity. The aim of the present study was to determine if sympathetic renal denervation and its effects on arterial pressure level can prevent cardiac hypertrophy and if it can also delay the onset and attenuate the severity of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. DOCA-salt treatment was initiated in rats seven days after uninephrectomy and contralateral renal denervation or sham renal denervation. DOCA (15 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (soybean oil, 0.25 ml per animal) was administered twice a week for two weeks. Rats treated with DOCA or vehicle (control) were provided drinking water containing 1% NaCl and 0.03% KCl. At the end of the treatment period, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate measurements were made in conscious animals. Under ether anesthesia, the heart was removed and the right and left ventricles (including the septum) were separated and weighted. DOCA-salt treatment produced a significant increase in left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratio (2.44 +/- 0.09 mg/g) and right ventricular weight/body weight (RVW/BW) ratio (0.53 +/- 0.01 mg/g) compared to control (1.92 +/- 0.04 and 0.48 +/- 0.01 mg/g, respectively) rats. MAP was significantly higher (39%) in DOCA-salt rats. Renal denervation prevented (P > 0.05) the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats but did not prevent the increase in LVW/BW (2.27 +/- 0.03 mg/g) and RVW/BW (0.52 +/- 0.01 mg/g). We have shown that the increase in arterial pressure level is not responsible for cardiac hypertrophy, which may be more related to other events associated with DOCA-salt hypertension, such as an increase in cardiac sympathetic activity.

TI  - MR imaging of hyaline cartilage at 0.5 T: a quantitative and qualitative in vitro evaluation of three types of sequences.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify an optimal pulse sequence for in vitro imaging of hyaline cartilage at 0.5 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve holes of varying diameter and depth were drilled in the cartilage of two pig knees. These were submerged in saline and scanned with a 0.5-T MR system. Sixteen T1-weighted gradient echo (GE), two T2-weighted GE, and 16 fast spin echo sequences were used, by varying repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), flip angle (FA), echo train length, profile order, and by use of fat saturation. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of cartilage versus saline solution and cartilage versus subchondral bone were measured. Cartilaginous lesions were evaluated separately by three independent observers. Interobserver variability and correlation between the quantitative and qualitative analyses were calculated. RESULTS: The mean CNRs of two specimens of cartilage versus saline solution ranged from 6.3 (+/- 2.1) to 27.7 (+/- 2.5), and those of cartilage versus subchondral bone from 0.3 (+/- 0.2) to 22.5 (+/- 1.4). The highest CNR was obtained with a T1-weighted spoiled 3D-GE technique (TR 65 ms, TE 11.5 ms, FA 45 degrees). The number of lesions observed per sequence varied from 35 to 69. Observer agreement was fair to good.  The T1-weighted spoiled GE sequences with a TR of 65 ms, TE of 11.5 ms and FA of 30 degrees and 45 degrees were significantly superior to the other 34 sequences in the qualitative analysis. CONCLUSION: T1-weighted spoiled 3D-GE sequences with a TR of 65 ms, a TE of 11.5 ms, and a FA of 30-45 degrees were found to be optimal for in vitro imaging of cartilage at 0.5T.

TI  - Liver transplantation in the first three months of life.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric liver transplant recipients have traditionally been grouped according to age. Age-based classification schemes are useful in identifying clinical problems in selected age groups and also for developing solutions to these problems. Although infants in the first 3 months of life have not traditionally been considered a distinct age group, several features of these infants may distinguish them from other pediatric liver transplant recipients. METHODS: The experience with liver transplantation in infants during the first 3 months of life in three large pediatric liver transplant programs (University of Chicago, Stanford University, and UCLA) was analyzed in order to characterize this group. RESULTS: A total of 23 liver transplants were performed at these three centers in children younger than 3 months of age. This group of patients comprised approximately 37% of the U.S. experience between 1988 and 1994 according to United Network for Organ Sharing statistics. Age distribution at the time of transplantation included the following: <1 month, 28%; 1-2 months, 35%; and 2-3 months, 36%. Median age at the time of transplantation was 37 days (range, 7-90 days), and mean age was 57+/-30 days.  Mean weight at the time of transplantation was 3.8+/-1.0 kg. Etiology of liver disease included idiopathic hepatitis, 52%; iron storage disease, 17%; and other causes, 31%. Types of liver allografts used included cadaveric, 85% (reduced size, 60%, and full-size, 25%); living donor, 15%; ABO-identical, 65%; and ABO-compatible, 35%. Actuarial patient and graft survival rates were 60% and 60% at 1 year and 60% and 42% at 2 years, respectively. Median follow-up was 1.5 years. Rejection occurred in 42% of patients, with a median time to first rejection of 13 days. Of these patients, 28% required steroids only and 14% required OKT3. Three patients (14%) were retransplanted at a median time to retransplantation of 1.6 years. Vascular thrombosis occurred in three patients (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation performed in infants younger than 3 months of age (1) provides acceptable short- and long-term patient and graft survival, (2) is associated with significant rates of rejection, and (3) is not associated with excessive rates of vascular thrombosis. The etiology of end-stage liver disease occurring in the first 3 months of life is distinct from that in other pediatric liver transplant recipient age groups. These infants should be referred promptly for liver transplantation as reasonable survival can be expected.

TI  - Fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) MRI in the assessment of intraaxial brain tumors.  
AB  - This study demonstrates the value of a fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) technique in the assessment of primary intraaxial brain tumors. Twenty-one patients with primary intraaxial brain tumors were examined by T2-weighted, proton-density-weighted fast spin echo, fast FLAIR, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo using identical slice parameters. The images were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria were tumor-to-background and tumor-to-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The qualitative evaluation was performed as a multireader analysis concerning lesion detection, lesion delineation, and image artifacts. In the qualitative evaluation, all readers found the fast FLAIR to be superior to fast spin echo in the exact delineation of intraaxial brain tumors (P < .001) and the delineation of enhancing and nonenhancing tumor parts. Fast FLAIR was superior in the delineation of cortically located and small lesions but was limited in lesions adjacent to the ventricles. Fast FLAIR provided a significantly better tumor-to-CSF contrast and tumor-to-CSF CNR (P < .001). The tumor-to-background contrast and tumor-to-background CNR of the fast FLAIR images were lower than those of T2-weighted spin-echo images but higher than those of proton-density-weighted spin-echo images. FLAIR images had more image artifacts influencing the image interpretation in only two patients. Signal hyperintensities at the ventricular border were present in 92% of the patients. They are common findings in fast FLAIR and should be included into the image interpretation.

TI  - Ferrous ion diminished the antiarrhythmic effect of naloxone in myocardial ischemia of isolated rat hearts.  
AB  - This investigation was to examine the effect of ferrous ion (a prooxidant) on the antiarrhythmic effect of naloxone (an endogenous opioid receptor antagonist) in isolated rat hearts. Isolated Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode and myocardial ischemia was performed by ligating the left descending coronary artery. Cardiac rhythm was recorded. Heart alpha-tocopherol concentrations were analyzed. Naloxone (1.2 micromol/heart) was effective in reducing the severity of arrhythmia (arrhythmia score; mean+/-S.E.M: 2.82+/-0.69 for naloxone vs. 5.18+/-0.38 for control, p<0.01). Fe2+ (100 nmol/heart) alone did not significantly affect the arrhythmia score (5.63+/-0.32) when compared with the control, however, Fe2+ administration did cause significant early onset of ventricular premature contraction and ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, Fe2+ administration diminished the naloxone's antiarrhythmic effect (arrhythmia score 4.12+/-0.40). Alpha-tocopherol, a major free radical scavenger that exerts protective functions on heart tissues during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, was significantly higher in the naloxone-treated group (59.05+/-3.00 nmol/g wet wt) than in the control group (43.84+/-4.17 nmol/g wet wt, p<0.05). These results suggest that endogenous opioid peptides and reactive oxygen species might be related to ischemia-induced arrhythmia.

TI  - Nitric oxide and prostacyclin are involved in antithrombotic action of captopril in venous thrombosis in rats.  
AB  - The long-term administration of captopril to patients with a left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction reduces the rate of recurrent coronary thrombosis. Thus, in the present study we investigated the influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) on experimental venous thrombosis in normotensive rats and the involvement of NO and PGI2 in this effect. Animals were treated with captopril (1.5, 5 or 25 mg/kg twice daily, CAP), enalapril (15 mg/kg once daily, ENA) or distilled water for 10 days, per os. After ligation of the vena cava the thrombus weight decreased in both CAP and ENA treated rats. The effect was most pronounced in animals given the highest dose of CAP (p<0.0001 vs. control) and was significantly stronger than observed in ENA treated animals (CAP vs. ENA p<0.01). The mean blood pressure measured by the "tail cuff" method and platelet aggregation were not altered by either of the ACE-Is. The antithrombotic activity of CAP was reduced by indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and independently by the NO-synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (3 mg/kg i.v. bolus + 3 mg/kg/h i.v. infusion, L-NAME). In the latter case CAP regained its antithrombotic properties in rats pretreated with L-Arginine (300 mg/kg i.v. + 300 mg/kg/h i.v.) before administration of L-NAME (p<0.05 vs. control). Moreover, the concomitant administration of indomethacin and L-NAME failed to completely abolish the antithrombotic action of captopril. Similar effects were observed in respect to the incidence of venous thrombosis. Our study documents a novel and important effect of ACE-Is on the vein thrombotic process and demonstrates the involvement of NO and PGI2 in this phenomenon.

TI  - Long-term effects of erythropoietin on platelet serotonin storage and platelet aggregation in hemodialysis patients with reference to ketanserin treatment.  
AB  - Correction of uremic platelet serotonin (5-HT) storage pool deficiency is one of the very early hemostatic effects of erythropoietin (Epo) therapy. In this work, platelet 5-HT with relation to primary hemostasis was studied in 15 hemodialysis patients treated with Epo for 8 months. Moreover, effects of ketanserin, a blocker of platelet and vascular smooth muscle cell 5-HT2A receptors, in these patients were followed. The parameters studied were compared with relevant values in healthy controls and in hemodialysis patients not treated with Epo, and remeasured in the long-term Epo patients after a 14-day oral ketanserin trial. Platelet 5-HT content in the eighth month of Epo therapy was not different from the one in untreated patients. Ristocetin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation were enhanced in comparison with both control groups, as opposed to unaltered response to ADP and arachidonic acid. Fibrinogen concentration was lower than in the untreated group. An inverse correlation between ADP-induced platelet aggregation and the skin bleeding time (r=-0.536, p<0.05) and a positive one between the former and platelet 5-HT (r=0.644, p<0.01) were found. Platelet count correlated positively with both platelet 5-HT (r=0.823, p<0.0002) and ADP-induced platelet aggregation (r=0.596, p<0.02). Ketanserin produced a decrease in ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, fibrinogen, and prolongation of the bleeding time. The first two of the changes correlated positively with their pre-ketanserin values (r=0.923, p<0.00001 and r=0.839, p< 0.0001, respectively). Post-ketanserin, positive correlations between depressed ristocetin- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation (r=0.760, p<0.005), and between collagen- and corresponding values of arachidonic acid- (r=0.622, p<0.02), ADP-induced platelet aggregation (r=0.396, p<0.01), and platelet 5-HT (r=0.654, p<0.05) were found. Efficient hemostasis in hemodialysis patients on protracted Epo therapy is, in part, dependent on enhanced platelet aggregability. Correction of platelet 5-HT storage pool deficiency is not evident in this stage but 5-HT still influences complex mechanisms of primary hemostasis. Ketanserin is of anticoagulant value in these patients but its effects must be weighted against possible exacerbation of the anemia.

TI  - Mouse lemur microscopic MRI brain atlas.  
AB  - We present a three-dimensional (3D) digital atlas of a mouse lemur head at 60-micron cubic voxel isotropic resolution. It was constructed from a 3D proton magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquired at 500 MHz. It shows views of 3D volume-rendering and movies of contiguous 2D plane cuts in three orthogonal directions. This MR data set was acquired using a spin-echo pulse sequence under conditions of strong T2 and significant diffusion weighting. Experimental parameters were optimized to provide strong intrinsic contrast between gray and white matter. Familiar anatomical structures are clearly identifiable. Fine fiber tracts, laminations of cortices, details of the inner ears, and layering in the lateral geniculate nuclei are all visible. Anatomical identifications of structures in representative slices selected from the atlas are presented. We also describe some difficulties and trade-offs encountered in microscopic resolution MRI. We note that this type of atlas does not suffer from the spatial distortions and slice registration problems introduced by standard histological techniques. Future in vivo longitudinal studies will provide atlases describing in detail the development of the primate brain.
