TI  - Effects of music and white noise on working memory performance in monkeys.  
AB  - It has been suggested that Mozart's music may have beneficial effects on the performance of cognitive tasks in humans. In the present study the effects of Mozart's piano music, white noise, simple rhythm and silence were studied on the performance of a delayed response (DR) task in monkeys. The acoustic treatments were given for 15 min, either before or during DR testing. The acoustic treatments did not affect DR performance when given before testing. However, Mozart's piano music played during DR testing caused a significant deterioration in the performance of the monkeys, whereas white noise improved it. It is suggested that Mozart's music serves as distractive stimulation during DR performance thus affecting working-memory-related neuronal processing and performance. White background noise, on the other hand, may improve DR performance by protecting against environmental distraction during testing.

TI  - Performance of a new, HIV/AIDS-targeted quality of life (HAT-QoL) instrument in asymptomatic seropositive individuals.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychometric performance of a new human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-targeted quality of life (QoL) instrument in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals. METHODS: 201 urban and rural, HIV-seropositive subjects were recruited to complete a 76-item pilot QoL measure developed using content provided in group process by seropositive individuals. Questionnaire responses from the full sample (n = 201) were used to identify dimensions and to reduce the number of items to 42. The responses to the retained items were then analysed for the asymptomatic subsample (n = 106). RESULTS: 9 multi-item dimensions were identified: overall function (OF), sexual function (SF), disclosure worries (DW), health worries (HW), financial worries (FW), HIV mastery (HM), life satisfaction (LS), medication concerns (MC) and provider trust (PT). The responses by asymptomatic subjects (74% male, 64% non-White and 63% homosexual/bisexual) revealed no substantial floor or ceiling effects, except for the PT dimension (where 44% were found to have scored the highest score). The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alphas) were between 0.80 and 0.89 for six dimensions. The coefficients were lower for the SF (0.52), HM (0.67) and MC (0.48) dimensions. Construct validity assessments, using self-reported HIV disease-severity and sociodemographic variables, revealed some significant relationships (p < or = 0.05) for all dimensions except SF, MC and PT. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that five dimensions (OF, DW, HW, FW and LS) from the new instrument have good psychometric properties for asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals. These dimensions may be useful in the study of asymptomatic, seropositive individuals' QoL. Four dimensions (SF, HM, MC and PS) require additional refinement for this subpopulation.

TI  - Differences in the prevalence of a TaqI RFLP in the 3' flanking region of the alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor gene between asthmatic and non-asthmatic black and white South Africans.  
AB  - The prevalence of the Taq I(-) allele in variants of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI) was investigated in a group of 28 black asthmatic patients and 32 black control individuals, and was compared to 43 white asthmatic patients and 32 white control individuals. The plasma concentration of alpha 1PI was determined in eight black and 14 white asthmatics without the Taq I(-) allele, and compared to seven black and three white asthmatics with the Taq I(-) allele. Alpha-1-PI concentration was also determined in 10 black and 29 white control individuals without the Taq I(-) allele and compared to seven black and three white controls with the Taq I(-) allele. There was a highly significant difference in the frequency of the Taq I(-) allele between black South Africans (24.1%) and white South Africans (6%) (p < 0.00001) and a significant difference in the frequency of the Taq I(-) allele between black asthmatics and white asthmatics (p = 0.0004) and between black controls and white controls (p = 0.011). The Taq I(-) allele was significantly associated with the M1 (Val213) variant as compared to the M1 (Ala213) of alpha 1PI (p = 0.0042). There was no difference in the concentration of alpha 1PI between the asthmatics (black and white) lacking the Taq I(-) allele and the asthmatics (black and white) with the allele. However, a significant increase in plasma alpha 1PI concentration was found in the asthmatics compared to the controls (p = 0.011). The Taq I(-) allele did not seem to interfere with the basal expression of alpha 1PI in the groups of asthmatic patients in this study.

TI  - Modulation of lipoprotein(a) atherogenicity by high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in middle-aged men with symptomatic coronary artery disease and normal to moderately elevated serum cholesterol. Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) Study Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine whether lipoprotein(a) levels predict coronary artery lumen changes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and normal to moderate hypercholesterolemia. BACKGROUND: Recent conflicting reports have confirmed or refuted the association of lipoprotein(a) with clinical events or angiographically verified disease progression. METHODS: The association between serum lipoprotein(a) and changes in coronary artery lumen was studied in 704 men entered into the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, quantitative angiographic study that assessed the effect of 2 years of pravastatin treatment. The primary end points were changes in average mean segment diameter (MSD) and average minimal obstruction diameter (MOD). Pravastatin- and placebo-treated patients were classified as having progressing, regressing or stable CAD, and median lipoprotein(a) concentrations were compared. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed in the overall patient group and in high risk subgroups. RESULTS: Pravastatin treatment did not affect serum apolipoprotein(a) levels. Median in-trial (sampled at 24 months) apolipoprotein(a) levels for regressing, stable and progressing CAD were, respectively, 130, 162 and 251 U/liter in placebo-treated patients and 143, 224 and 306 U/liter in pravastatin-treated patients. Predictors of MSD and MOD changes were baseline MSD and MOD, in-trial apolipoprotein(a), in-trial high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and baseline use of long-acting nitrates. The multivariate models predicted 14% of MSD changes and 12% of MOD changes; apolipoprotein(a) predicted only 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively. However, in patients with in-trial HDL cholesterol levels <0.7 mmol/liter, apolipoprotein(a) predicted up to 37% of the arteriographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Serum lipoprotein(a) levels predict coronary artery lumen changes in normal to moderately hypercholesterolemic white men with CAD; its atherogenicity is marked in the presence of concomitant hypoalphalipoproteinemia.

TI  - Mammography underutilization among older women in Connecticut [published erratum appears in J Am Geriatr Soc 1998 Jan;46(1):57]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary goals were to examine mammography use rates among older women in Connecticut and to determine if there was significant variation among different areas and racial groups in the state. The secondary goal was to examine what impact the initiation of Medicare reimbursement for mammography screening has had on mammography use. DESIGN: Statewide use rates were determined by retrospective Medicare Part B mammography claims analysis. Small area analysis methodology (SAA) was used to identify mammography rates for 23 hospital service areas (HSAs), representing all of the catchment areas for Connecticut's acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Female Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older with Part B coverage residing in Connecticut during the study period. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome (the use of at least one mammogram) was calculated for the calendar years 1991, 1992, and 1993. Mean annual use rates in 1993 were generated for the 23 HSAs and the different racial groups in Connecticut. To examine the effect that Medicare reimbursement for screening mammograms has had on mammography use, rates were calculated for women who met Medicare reimbursement criteria in 1991 through 1993. The rates in 1992 and 1993 were then compared with those in 1991, when the reimbursement program was first initiated. MAIN RESULTS: The mean statewide annual rates among women aged 65 years and older were 23.4% (1991), 24.5% (1992), and 24.9% (1993). The mammography use rates among black women 65 years and older were significantly lower than their white peers in 1991 (18.8% black vs 23.8% white, P < .001), 1992 (20.6% vs 24.7%, P < .001), and 1993 (22.0% vs 25.1%, P < .001). Significant variation was identified among hospital service areas (HSAs) within the state for each time interval studied. The use rates among women aged 65 years and older who were eligible for Medicare screening mammography reimbursement increased significantly from 14.6% in 1991, when Medicare reimbursement for screening mammograms was first initiated, to 18.9% in 1992 (P < .001). The rates in 1993 (17.4%) also increased from the baseline year 1991 (P < .001). However, the observed increases since 1991 have been limited in magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: Low mammography use persists among older women in Connecticut and, in particular, among older black women. The initiation of Medicare reimbursement for screening mammograms in 1991 has had some impact on mammography use although its effects are still limited. Through the use of small area analysis methodology, significant underutilization of mammography in localized areas of the state was identified. These findings have facilitated local outreach interventions. Additional research is needed to understand if health service barriers are contributing to the local variation in rates observed in this study.

TI  - The treatment of severe hypertension with trandolapril, verapamil, and hydrochlorothiazide. Trandolapril/Verapamil Multicenter Study Group [see comments]  
AB  - A multiple drug regimen consisting of trandolapril, verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were sequentially added in an open-label evaluation of patients with severe hypertension. Ninety patients (58 white and 32 black patients) were titrated on one or more drugs and followed for a 19-week maintenance period. Statistically significant (P = 0.001) mean (+/-s.d.) decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 9.0 (+/-9.3) mm Hg for trandolapril, 13.9 (+/-11.0) mm Hg for the trandolapril + verapamil (TV) combination, and 19.0 (+/-12.3) mm Hg when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the combination. The decrease in BP observed on TV combination therapy plus HCTZ was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for the TV combination, which was significantly (P = 0.001) greater than the decrease observed for trandolapril monotherapy. Clinical responder rates were 44.8%, 56% and 77.7% for trandolapril monotherapy, trandolapril + verapamil combination therapy and triple therapy, respectively. Black and white patients had similar response rates, but black patients appeared to benefit more from the addition of HCTZ; 20% of black patients achieved a post-treatment supine DBP <90 mm Hg compared to 12.8% of white patients. This study demonstrates that the addition of verapamil to trandolapril has an additive effect on BP that is maintained throughout the day.

TI  - The risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure among older adults.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to estimate the 8-year rate of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF), to report the resources consumed, and to evaluate previously reported risk factors in a nationally representative sample of 7,286 older white and black adults. METHODS: Secondary analysis of baseline interview data was linked to Medicare hospitalization and death records for 1984 to 1991. Hospitalization for CHF was defined as having one or more episodes with an International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision, clinical modification) discharge code of 428. Combined and separate analyses of first-listed and second-through fifth-listed CHF discharge diagnoses were conducted. Multivariable proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risks in pooled analyses of all white and black men and women and in separate stratified analyses of white men and white women. RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, 1,102 or 15.1% of the 7,286 older white and black adults were hospitalized for CHF (7.1% with first-listed and 8.1% with second- through fifth-listed diagnoses). The 1- and 5-year combined postdischarge mortality rates were 34.7% and 69.0%, respectively. In descending order, the major risk factors for being hospitalized for CHF in the combined, pooled analysis were age, being a white man, having lower body functional limitations, and having self-reported medical histories of coronary heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and angina. The increased risk associated with age was not linear, and it diminished significantly over the course of life. Some significant differences were observed in the risk factors for hospitalization for first-listed versus second- through fifth-listed CHF and in the risk factors for white women versus white men. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for CHF among older adults is a common, costly event with a poor prognosis. The differential risk for white men remains unexplained and warrants further study.

TI  - Physician characteristics: do they influence the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer in older women?  
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine if physician specialty, length of time in practice, and fear of malpractice influence the diagnosis and management of breast cancer in older women. METHODS: We used a fractional factorial design that controlled for patient age (65 or 80 years), race, socioeconomic status, mobility, comorbidity, and assertive behavior through 2 videotaped scenarios (a potential breast cancer [no. 1] and a known stage IIA breast cancer [no. 2]).  One hundred twenty-eight white male physicians equally divided by specialty (surgeon versus nonsurgeon) and time in practice (< or = 15 or >15 years) viewed the videotapes and made recommendations. RESULTS: The physician subjects saw 46 patients per week, 59% female, and 47% age > or = 65. Their concern over malpractice was 4.7 (on a 10-point Likert scale with a higher score indicating more concern) and did not differ by specialty or time in practice (P values > 0.7). After viewing scenario no. 1, surgeons were less likely than nonsurgeons to consider breast cancer as the principal diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 0.9) and to obtain a tissue diagnosis (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.9). However, in scenario no. 2, surgeons were more likely to offer reconstruction (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.4 to 10.4). Physicians in practice < or = 15 years were more likely than those in practice <15 years to obtain a tissue diagnosis in scenario no. 1 (OR = 6.1, 95% CI = 1.9 to 19.2) and to perform full primary therapy in scenario no. 2 (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 6.9). Physicians who performed an extensive metastatic evaluation (bone or computer tomography [CT] scan) had greater concern over malpractice than those who did not, as did physicians who performed an axillary node dissection (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.4 and OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1 to 3.0). CONCLUSIONS: With the uncertainty of how to diagnose and treat older women with breast cancer, physician specialty, length of time in practice, and concern over malpractice do influence clinical decisions.

AB  - A 300 bp fragment from exon 6 of the white gene of Bactrocera tryoni was used to screen a B. tryoni genomic library. One positive (approximately 14 kb) insert contained exons 2-6 of white by nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity to the white genes of D. melanogaster (O'Hare et al., 1984; Pepling & Mount, 1990). Lucilia cuprina (Garcia et al., 1996). Ceratitis capitata (Zwiebel et al., 1995) and Anopheles gambiae (Besansky et al., 1995). A white 5' cDNA fragment containing exons 1, 2 and part of exon 3 was amplified, cloned and sequenced. An inverse PCR fragment of genomic DNA was generated, containing the exon 1 coding region plus approximately 2.1 kb of upstream sequence, encompassing the putative promoter of the gene. Exon 1 was found to be 728 bp long, encoding the first twenty-five amino acids. The full length of intron 1 was shown to be 12 kb (amplified using long PCR protocols), up to 3 times the length of the longest white intron 1 isolated to date.

TI  - Feather pecking behaviour in White Leghorns, a genetic study.  
AB  - 1. Genetic variables of feather pecking (FP) behaviour in a 1993 commercial pure line of White Leghorns were estimated at the age of 6, 38 and 69 weeks. 2. Heritability estimates of performing FP were 0.05 +/- 0.06, 0.14* +/- 0.07 and 0.38** +/- 0.12 for 6, 38 and 69 weeks respectively for sum of pecks (PECKS) and 0.13* +/- 0.07, 0.13* +/- 0.07 and 0.35** +/- 0.12 for sum of bouts (BOUTS). 3. Heritability estimates of receiving FP were not significantly different from 0 except at 6 weeks (0.15* +/- 0.07 and the average of the 3 age classes (AVG) (0.22** +/- 0.09) for PECKS and at 6 weeks (0.15* +/- 0.07) using BOUTS. 4. Genetic correlations of performing FP among age classes were in general high and significant. This was not the case with receiving FP. 5. Plumage cover at 51 weeks had a negative genetic correlation with performing FP at 69 weeks and AVG, but not with receiving FP. No phenotypic correlations were significant between plumage and FP. 6. Body weight at 51 weeks had a negative genetic correlation with performing FP at AVG. 7. Heritability estimates for performing and receiving FP at 6 weeks correspond to those in the literature. No estimates have previously been reported on feather pecking at 38 weeks or 69 weeks. 8. Selection of birds with no or a very low tendency to perform feather pecking should, on the basis of our results, be feasible.

TI  - Flight-muscle polymorphism in the cricket Gryllus firmus: muscle characteristics and their influence on the evolution of flightlessness.  
AB  - Flight muscles of the cricket Gryllus firmus are polymorphic, existing as pink or white phenotypes. White muscles are smaller in size, have reduced number and size of muscle fibers, and have reduced in vitro enzyme activities and respiration rates relative to pink muscles of newly molted, fully winged adults. G. firmus is also polymorphic for wing length. All newly molted long-winged adults exhibited the pink-muscle phenotype, while most newly molted short-winged adults exhibited the white-muscle phenotype, which resulted from arrested muscle growth. As long-winged adults aged, fully grown pink muscle was transformed into white muscle via histolysis. The substantially higher respiration rate of pink muscle likely contributes to the elevated whole-organism respiration rate of long-winged females, which has been documented previously and which is thought to divert nutrients from egg production. Histolyzed white flight muscle from long-winged crickets also exhibited significantly elevated respiration rate and enzyme activities compared with underdeveloped white muscle from short-winged adults, although these differences were not as great as those between pink and white muscles. Fecundity was much more elevated in females with white verus pink flight muscles than it was in females with short versus long wings. The fitness gain resulting from flightlessness has typically been estimated in previous studies by comparing enhanced egg production of short-winged and long-winged females, without considering the influence of flight-muscle variation. Our results suggest that the magnitude of this fitness gain has been substantially underestimated.

TI  - Absence of alpha-sarcoglycan and novel missense mutations in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene in a young British girl with muscular dystrophy.  
AB  -  An 11-year-old white female presented with progressive proximal muscle weakness and marked calf hypertrophy. Muscle biopsy showed severe dystrophy with normal expression of dystrophin. There was complete absence of the 50kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (alpha-sarcoglycan). DNA analysis showed novel point mutations (one missense and one splicing) in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene at chromosomal location 17q21, confirming the diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D (LGMD-2D). We believe this is one of the first confirmed white cases of primary alpha-sarcoglycanopathy identified in the UK. This case supports the assumption of a wide geographic prevalence of severe childhood onset autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy and genetic heterogeneity. In the future, with improved diagnostic accuracy it is likely that more cases demonstrating primary or secondary deficiency of alpha-sarcoglycan will be identified. We would recommend staining for dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (sarcoglycans) in all new cases of muscular dystrophy with normal dystrophin, and confirmation with DNA analysis where possible.

TI  - A comparison of predictors of success on NCLEX-RN for African American, foreign-born, and white baccalaureate graduates.  
AB  - This retrospective study was concerned with identifying the strongest predictors of success for African American and foreign-born baccalaureate graduates on the NCLEX-RN from the following nine variables--the admission grade point average, medical-surgical nursing grade point average, nursing grade point average, cumulative grade point average, percentile rank on the Mosby Assess Test, age at the time of the licensing examination, number of semesters needed to complete the nursing curriculum, licensed vocational nurse status, and the number of Ds and Fs received in nursing courses--and comparing these with predictors of success for white baccalaureate graduates. Three random samples of 50 African American, foreign-born, and white graduates from four baccalaureate schools from May 1987 through May 1992 were selected from a total population of 1,205. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, two-way analysis of variance, and discriminant analysis were used to analyze the data. Students in all three ethnic groups with a Mosby Assess Test percentile rank below 21 and a D or F in a nursing course were more likely to fail the NCLEX-RN than those with a higher percentile rank and no Ds or Fs.

TI  - Giant cell arteritis manifesting as chronic cough and fever of unknown origin.  
AB  -  A 57-year-old white man sought medical attention because of chronic cough and fever of unknown origin. An extensive work-up over 4 weeks, including repeated blood cultures, chest roentgenograms, a gallium scan, and computed tomographic scans of the sinuses, chest, and abdomen, was nondiagnostic. The patient was referred to our institution for bronchoscopy. Further analysis of his history revealed that he had a headache in conjunction with the cough and an episode of a flashing color design in his left eye 1 week before assessment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 115 mm in 1 hour. A biopsy of the temporal artery showed granulomatous inflammation of the vessel wall with multinucleated giant cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and few eosinophils. The multinucleated giant cells were closely related to the fragmented elastic lamina. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in prompt resolution of the chronic cough and fever. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough.

TI  - Cancer mortality among laundry and dry cleaning workers.  
AB  - A cancer mortality study of 8,163 deaths occurring among persons formerly employed as laundering and dry cleaning workers in 28 states is described. Age-adjusted sex-race cause-specific proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and proportionate cancer mortality ratios (PCMRs) were computed for 1979 through 1990, using the corresponding 28-state mortality as the comparison. For those aged 15-64 years, there were excesses in black men for total cancer mortality (PMR = 130, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 105-159) and cancer of the esophagus 1 (PMR = 215, 95% CI = 111-376), and in white men for cancer of the larynx (PMR = 318, 95% CI = 117-693). For those aged 65 years and over, there were statistically nonsignificant excesses for cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung in black women (PMR = 128, CI = 94-170) and for cancer of other and unspecified female genital organs in white women (PMR = 225, CI = 97-443). The results of this and other studies point to the need for the effective implementation of available control measures to protect laundry and dry cleaning workers.

TI  - Levels of heavy metals in seals of Lake Ladoga and the White Sea.  
AB  - Between 1990 and 1993 samples of hair, liver, kidney and muscle were collected from 28 ringed seals from Lake Ladoga, Phoca hispida ladogensis, 20 ringed seals, Phoca hispida hispida, and three bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus, from the White Sea for heavy-metal residue analyses in tissues. The concentration of Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The samples of hair and liver contained the highest mean levels of the elements analysed and the muscle contained the lowest mean heavy-metal concentrations. Age and sex differences in the accumulation of pollutants were found. Tissues of Ladoga ringed seal were to a greater extent contaminated with the heavy metals studied than the tissues of the White Sea pinnipeds.

TI  - Short latency vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) to linear acceleration impulses in rats.  
AB  - In this study, short latency (t < 12.7 ms) vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) in response to linear acceleration impulses were recorded in 37 rats. A new technique (based on a solenoid) was used for generating linear force impulses that were delivered to the animal's head. The impulse had a maximal peak acceleration of 12 g. During the impulse, the displacement was 50 microns (at 4 g) and the rise time was 1.0 ms. A stimulation rate of 2/s was usually used. The VsEPs (averaged responses to 128 stimulations, digital filter: 300-1500 Hz) were recorded with electrodes on pinna and vertex, and were composed of 4-6 clear waves with mean amplitudes (for a 4 g stimulus) of 1-5 microV. The VsEPs were resistant to white noise masking, and were significantly suppressed (P < 0.05) following bilateral application of a saturated KCl solution to the inner ear, showing that contributions of the auditory and somatosensory systems are negligible. The latency of the response decreased as a power law function of stimulus magnitude, and the amplitude of the first wave increased as a sigmoid function of stimulus magnitude. VsEP responses were still present at the lowest intensities attainable (0.06-0.4 g) and reached saturation at 9 g. The amplitude of the later components was reduced when stimulus rate was elevated to 20/s. These results suggest that VsEPs in response to linear accelerations are similar in their nature to VsEPs in response to angular acceleration impulses that were previously recorded. These VsEPs to linear accelerations are most likely initiated in the otolith organs.

TI  - Treatment of metastatic liver tumors by intermittent repetitive injection of an angiogenesis inhibitor using an implantable port system in a rabbit model.  
AB  - Angiogenesis inhibitors are expected as a new type of anticancer drug, because they may prevent tumor neovascularization. Among several angiogenesis inhibitors, 6-o-(N-chloroacetylcarbamoyl)-fumagillol (TNP-470) is thought to inhibit the proliferation of migrating endothelial cells, as an aspect of angiogenesis, and attracts an attention for clinical application. We attempted to evaluate anticancer effects of intermittent repetitive intraportal injection of TNP-470 for metastatic liver tumor models and considered the usefulness and a role as an angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470, in the anti-cancer therapy using an implantable port system. We used 25 Japanese white rabbits with metastatic liver tumors made by intraportal injection of tumor cells (VX2-carcinoma), and divided those into five groups; group A was control group, group B was treated by repetitive subcutaneous injection of TNP-470 and group C, D, E was treated by repetitive intraportal injection of TNP-470, adriamycin, TNP-470 + adriamycin respectively 5 times at 2 or 3 days interval after tumor inoculation using implantable port systems. After 2 weeks, we evaluated anti-cancer effect of TNP-470 pathologically. In the number of grown tumors, there was no difference among five groups statisitically. But the mean tumor size of each group is smaller in order of group E, D, C, B, A and the differences were significant (P < 0.05) except between E and D group. And intratumoral neovascularization tended to be less in group B, C, E than in group A, D pathologically. We consider that intermittent repetitive injection of TNP-470 is more useful than systemic administration for metastatic liver tumors and the administration of angiogenesis inhibitor with other anti-cancer agents via an implantable port system will be one of the most effective therapeutic methods for them.

TI  - Body composition of a young, multiethnic, male population.  
AB  - The study objective was to establish the range of total body-composition values for a young, multiethnic, healthy male population (aged 3-18 y) by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results for 297 males in three ethnic groups [European American (white), n = 145; African American (black), n = 78; and Mexican American (Hispanic), n = 74] are reported. Bone mineral content (BMC), lean tissue mass (LTM), body fat mass, and percentage fat are presented as functions of age. Analysis of variance with age, weight, and height as covariates was used to evaluate differences among the three ethnic groups. BMC and LTM were higher in black than in white males, but no difference in BMC or LTM was evident between the white and Hispanic groups. The relation between total-body BMC and LTM was linear (r = 0.985, P < 0.0001) and independent of age or ethnic classification. The Hispanic males had higher body fat values than the white group, whereas the black males generally had lower values than the white group. When adjusted for body size, the Hispanic males continued to have significantly higher body fat and percentage fat than the white or black males. Ethnic-specific equations for the prediction of body composition as a function of age, weight, and height were derived. The results for the white males in the present study were compared with DXA-derived reference data reported in other countries for young white males. We conclude that reference values of total body composition for young healthy males need to be ethnic specific.

TI  - [Reactivity of "white coat" type is associated with reactivity to mental stress]  
AB  - This study was aimed to compare the white coat effect and the response to a mental stress. 29 subjects, referred for high blood pressure (BP) were included. Systolic BP (SBP) was recorded beat-to-beat with a Finapres device during 3 periods of at least 5 minutes: 1) rest (alone, in lying position); 2) white coat (5 measurements of BP with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer by the same physician); 3) mental stress (version for computer of the Stroop Word Color Conflict Test). A Coarse-graining spectral analysis was performed to compute the power in the low frequency band (PLF: 0-0.150 Hz) and in the high frequency band (PHF: 0.150-0.500 Hz). SBP was 142 +/- 3.7 during the rest period and increased significantly during the white coat (156.7 +/- 3.9 mmHg) and the mental stress (190.7 +/- 4.8 mmHg) periods. These rises of SBP levels were associated with a rise of PLF, significant only during mental stress (11.3 +/- 1.4, 15.7 +/- 3.7, 17.2 +/- 2.4 mmHg2/Hz, during rest, white coat and mental stress periods, respectively). Moreover, a significant correlation (r = 0.76; p < 0.0001) was found between the white coat effect (PAS "white coat"-PAS "rest") and the response to stress (PAS "stress"-PAS "rest"). This work shows that white coat effect is not a specific response but may rather represent an increased reactivity to stress. As it is associated with an increased power in the LF band like the response to stress, this white coat effect may involve an activation of the sympathetic system.

TI  - Improving uptake of breast screening in multiethnic populations: a randomised controlled trial using practice reception staff to contact non-attenders.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a two hour training programme for general practice reception staff could improve uptake in patients who had failed to attend for breast screening, and whether women from different ethnic groups benefited equally. DESIGN: Controlled trial, randomised by general practice. SETTING: Inner London borough of Newham. SUBJECTS: 2064 women aged 50-64 years who had failed to attend for breast screening. Women came from 26 of 37 eligible practices, 31% were white, 17% were Indian, 10% Pakistani, 14% black, 6% Bangladeshi, 1% Chinese, 4% were from other ethnic groups, and in 16% the ethnic group was not reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance for breast screening in relation to ethnic group in women who had not taken up their original invitation. RESULTS: Attendance in the intervention group was significantly better than in the control group (9% v 4%). The response was best in Indian women--it was 19% in the intervention group and 5% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This simple, low cost intervention improved breast screening rates modestly. Improvement was greatest in Indian women--probably because many practice staff shared their cultural and linguistic background. This intervention could be effective as part of a multifaceted strategy to improve uptake in areas with low rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare fasting plasma lipids and lipoproteins in male and female patients at diagnosis of NIDDM and to examine age and sex differences in lipid concentrations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of fasting plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride in 2,139 male and 1,574 female white patients, aged 25-65 years, at diagnosis of NIDDM. RESULTS: At diagnosis of NIDDM, the mean age +/- SD for men was 52 +/- 9 and 53 +/- 9 years for women; BMI was 28.3 +/- 4.9 and 30.8 +/- 6.7 kg/m2, and fasting plasma glucose was 11.6 +/- 3.6 and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mmol/l, respectively. The mean total and LDL cholesterol were higher in female than in male NIDDM patients, 5.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 3.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l (both P < 0.001), respectively, while triglyceride levels were similar: geometric mean (1 SD interval) for men and women was 1.8 (1.1-3.1) vs. 1.8 (1.1-2.9) mmol/l. HDL cholesterol was higher in female than in male NIDDM patients, 1.09 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.01 +/- 0.24 mmol/l (P < 0.001); the sex differential for HDL cholesterol was 7% in NIDDM patients compared with 22% in the general population. Data analysis by 5-year age bands showed a significant trend toward lower total cholesterol and triglyceride and higher HDL cholesterol in men diagnosed above the age of 50 years. In female NIDDM patients, lipid concentrations increased with age of diagnosis but reached a plateau above the age of 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of NIDDM, observed at diagnosis, on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels is more pronounced in women than in men. This may explain in part why the cardiovascular risk is proportionally higher in female patients.

We had to evaluate and differentiate the initial roentgenographic post-traumatic mediastinal enlargement in order definitely to exclude a suspected covered rupture of the thoracic aorta or the heart caused by this high-velocity deceleration trauma. The difficulties encountered are critically discussed with regard to the unexpected primary thymoma that was diagnosed postoperatively. The diagnostic algorithm in blunt chest injury is also discussed. The controversy about the classification and management options of primary thymic tumors is also presented.

TI  - Co-refolding denatured-reduced hen egg white lysozyme with acidic and basic proteins.  
AB  - Refolding of denatured-reduced lysozyme and the effect of co-refolding it with other proteins such as RNase A, bovine serum albumin, histone, myelin basic protein, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNase I on the renaturation yield and the aggregation of lysozyme have been studied. Basic proteins consistently increase the renaturation yield of the basic protein lysozyme (10-20% more than in their absence) with little or no aggregation. On the other hand, co-refolding of lysozyme with acidic proteins leads to aggregation and a significant decrease in renaturation yields. Our results show that hetero-interchain interactions (non-specific interactions) occur when the basic protein lysozyme is refolded together with acidic proteins such as bovine serum albumin, alcohol dehydrogenase or DNase I. Our results also suggest that the net charge on proteins plays a significant role in such non-specific aggregation. These results should prove useful in understanding the hetero-interchain interactions between folding polypeptide chains.

AB  - In part I of this study, a method for the objective evaluation of profile nasal esthetics was presented and applied to establish normative values for young adult white males and females. Male and female nasal profile esthetics were found to be virtually identical. In part II, the data from the preoperative lateral cephalograms of 13 young adult white female patients with vertical maxillary excess (VME) were compared to the normative data established for females in part I. Results showed a distinct nasal profile in patients with VME. In this part of the study, the postoperative lateral cephalograms of the 13 female patients from part II were analyzed after surgical correction of their vertical maxillary dysplasia to determine if returning the maxilla to a more normal position effected similar changes in nasal profile esthetics. All patients had superior repositioning of the maxilla for which the magnitude of movement was greatest in the superior direction, with the mean movement being 2.3 mm superiorly. The results revealed that surgical correction of VME effected normalization of most of the nasal profile esthetic characteristics.

We examined if texture analysis of radiofrequency (r.f.) data or videodensitometric data (VD) could distinguish thrombi of different ages and cell compositions. Whole human blood (red clot = RC), platelet-rich plasma (white clot = WC) and plasma (n = 6/group) were imaged at 4 and 24 h with 30 MHz IVUS transducers. At 4 h, VD- and r.f.-based analyses revealed significant differences between RC and WC with variance (VD red 26.4 +/- 2.5, white 33.9 +/- 7.8; r.f. red 1.4 +/- 0.5, white 4.9 +/- 1.3), kurtosis (VD red 0.29 +/- 0.9, white 0.23 +/- 0.3) and skewness (VD red 0.23 +/- 0.13, white 0.35 +/- 0.52; r.f. red 0.06 +/- 0.01, white -0.06 +/- 0.05). Also mean grey-level from both data sets was higher in RC (VD 134.8 +/- 18.0; r.f. -13.3 +/- 1.2) than in WC (VD 105.3 +/- 17.4, r.f. 16.5 +/- 2.2) (p < 0.01). With increasing time, variance increased in WC (5.5 +/- 1.5 at 24 h) and decreased in RC (0.9 +/- 0.3.3 at 24 h). The more heterogeneous structure of WC may be distinguished from that of RC using texture analysis of either VD or r.f.-signals.

TI  - High-risk sexual behavior among drug users. The utility of a typology of alcohol variables.  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a typology of drug users based on alcohol use variables and then determine the utility of this typology for predicting high-risk sexual behavior, controlling for the personality traits of sensation seeking and risk proneness. METHODS: A sample of 283 out-of-treatment drug users in Anchorage, Alaska, were interviewed regarding their alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior, sensation seeking, and risk proneness. The sample was 66% male; 44% white, 26% black, and 24% Native American; had a median age of 36 years; and a median monthly income of $500 to $999. RESULTS: Cluster analyses of alcohol variables showed the presence of two clusters, one of which is characterized by relatively high alcohol consumption and early age of first alcohol use. This alcohol typology was significantly related to several sexual risk behaviors, including having sex with multiple partners without consistent condom use (chi 2(1) = 10.47, p < .01), having sex with an injection drug user (IDU) without consistent condom use (chi 2(1) = 4.87, p < .05), number of sex partners (t(281) = -2.16, p < .05), STD history (chi 2(1) = 7.86, p < .01), and having traded sex for drugs or money recently (chi 2(1) = 6.91, p < .01) or in one's lifetime (chi 2(1) = 9.20, p < .01). All but one of these associations remained significant after controlling for sensation seeking and risk proneness. CONCLUSIONS: Among this sample of out-of-treatment drug users, a typology based on patterns of alcohol use was found to be associated with several measures of high-risk sexual behavior. Drug users who were classified as high risk on the basis of their lifetime and current alcohol use patterns were found to be significantly more likely than low-risk drug users to have engaged in risky sexual behavior. Risk proneness does not appear to account for this pattern of associations.

TI  - Secular trends in the United States black/white hypertension prevalence ratio: potential impact of diminishing response rates.  
AB  - In this integrative review, the authors analyzed 25 studies on hypertension prevalence among black and white adults (1960-1991). The authors made the following inferences: 1) both female (2.59 vs. 1.77) and male (2.20 vs. 1.38) black/white hypertension prevalence ratios have diminished by approximately a third over the past three decades; 2) response rates were significantly lower among the more recent surveys (i.e., 1976 or later, mean 69.2 percent (standard deviation (SD) 6.9) vs. 1960 to 1975, mean 86.1 percent (SD 9.1)); and 3) these two trends are directly associated--response rates may account for a third (women, R2 = 0.362) to nearly a half (men, R2 = 0.469) of the variability in black-white hypertension differentials. These findings suggest that although respondent-based research has found black and white adults in the United States to be increasingly similar in hypertension prevalence, the same may not be true of the entire adult population (responders and nonresponders). The apparent diminishment over time in the black-white hypertension gap is as likely to be a methodological artifact allied with declining response rates as a true parametric phenomenon resultant from substantive factors such as enhanced treatment effectiveness among blacks.

TI  - The effects of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite on interleukin-8 and elastase from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood.  
AB  - Inhaled nitric oxide is now widely used in the treatment of hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension in critically ill patients. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil elastase are important markers of the onset and severity of acute lung injury. We studied the effects of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite on IL-8) and elastase accumulation in lipopolysaccharide-activated whole blood. The nitric oxide donor (GEA-3162) did not affect IL-8 accumulation (P = 0.195) but did cause an increase in elastase accumulation (P = 0.007). The peroxynitrite donor (SIN-1) caused an increase in both IL-8 accumulation (P = 0.0004) and elastase accumulation (P = 0.007). The lack of effect of nitric oxide could be explained by the scavenging of nitric oxide by hemoglobin. These results suggest that modulation of the inflammatory response may occur during inhaled nitric oxide therapy in the critically ill. Implications: Inhaled nitric oxide, used in lung injury, reacts within the lung, forming peroxynitrite. We investigated the effect of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite on interleukin-8 and elastase release by white cells during inflammation. Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite had marked effects on elastase and interleukin-8, which suggests modulation of the inflammatory response.

TI  - Trait association of genetic markers in the growth hormone and the growth hormone receptor gene in a White Leghorn strain.  
AB  - Alleles of the growth hormone (GH) gene and GH receptor (GHR) gene were analyzed for association with juvenile body weight (HBWT), age at first egg (AFE), the hen-day rate of egg production (HDR), egg specific gravity (SPG), and egg weight (EWT) in a strain of White Leghorns. The particular strain segregated at near equal frequencies for two GH alleles defined by differences at three restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and for two GHR alleles defined by a single RFLP. The GH genotype was significantly associated with AFE (P < or = 0.04) as well as HDR from 274 to 385 d (P < or = 0.04) and 386 to 497 d (P < or = 0.0003). The GHR genotype (haploid in female chickens) had trends for association with HBW (P < or = 0.06) and HDR from AFE to 273 d (P < or = 0.07). The effects on the egg quality traits SPG and EWT were not significant. Regression analysis revealed that HDR was associated negatively with AFE and positively with HBWT. The slope of the regression line of HDR on AFE varied with the GH genotype, with the effect that the differences in HDR between GH genotypes was relatively small in chickens with early AFE and large in chickens with late AFE. Similarly, the slope of the regression of HDR on HBWT varied between GHR genotypes, with the result that the effect of the GHR genotype on HDR in chickens with low HBWT was opposite to its effect in chickens with high HBWT. The complex relationship between genotypes and traits may reflect gene interaction and indicates that simple models based on additive gene effects may not be adequate for the dissection of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits.

TI  - Re-feeding after starvation involves a temporal shift in the control site of glycogen synthesis in rat muscle.  
AB  - The starved-to-fed transition is accompanied by rapid glycogen deposition in skeletal muscles. On the basis of recent findings [Brau, Ferreira, Nikolovski, Raja, Palmer and Fournier (1997) Biochem. J. 322, 303-308] that during recovery from exercise there is a shift from a glucose 6-phosphate/phosphorylation-based control of glycogen synthesis to a phosphorylation-based control alone, this paper seeks to establish whether a similar shift occurs in muscle during re-feeding after starvation in the rat. Chow re-feeding after 48 h of starvation resulted in glycogen deposition in all muscles examined (white, red and mixed quadriceps, soleus and diaphragm) to levels higher than those in the fed state. Although the early phase of re-feeding was associated with increases in glucose 6-phosphate levels in all muscles, there was no accompanying increase in the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase except in the white quadriceps muscle. This finding, together with the observation that the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase in most muscles was already high in the starved state, suggests that in the initial phase of glycogen deposition the phosphorylation state of the enzyme may be adequate to support net glycogen synthesis. In the later phase of re-feeding, the progressive decrease in the fractional velocity of glycogen synthase in association with a decrease in the rate of glycogen deposition suggests that glycogen synthesis is controlled primarily by changes in the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase. In conclusion, this study suggests that there is a temporal shift in the site of control of glycogen synthesis as glycogen deposition progresses during re-feeding after starvation.

TI  - Uncoupling of immune complex formation and kidney damage in autoimmune glomerulonephritis.  
AB  - The generation of autoantibody and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes (IC) is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune disease. Modulation of the autoantibody response disrupts pathogenesis by preventing the formation of ICs; however, uncoupling IC formation from subsequent inflammatory responses seems unlikely because of the apparent complexity of the IC-triggered inflammatory cascade. However, the disruption of a single gene, which encodes the gamma chain of the Fc receptor, was found to achieve this uncoupling in a spontaneous model of lupus nephritis, the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White (NZB/NZW) mouse. Gamma chain-deficient NZB/NZW mice generated and deposited IC and activated complement, but were protected from severe nephritis, thus defining another potential pathway for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disease.

TI  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity in adipose tissues and liver of growing Large White and Meishan pigs.  
AB  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was measured in adipose tissue (backfat and neckfat) and liver microsomes of Large White and Meishan pigs. Preliminary assays have shown that delta 9-desaturase activity cannot be measured on frozen tissues, because freezing involves a loss in activity of 40-50%. The specific activity of liver delta 9-desaturase was much lower than that of the adipose tissues in both breeds, indicating that the liver is not a major site of oleate synthesis in the pig. The hepatic delta 9-desaturase activity was higher in Meishan than in Large White pigs. However, delta 9-desaturase activity in the adipose tissue of Large White pigs was much higher than that of Meishan pigs, even though the percentage of oleate was slightly higher in the adipose tissues of the latter. This investigation has demonstrated that differences in fatty acid composition of adipose tissues between Large White and Meishan pigs cannot be attributed to differences in delta 9-desaturase activity at this stage of maturity. These results suggest that the higher oleate percentage in Meishan adipose tissues would result from a higher delta 9-desaturase activity at an earlier age.

TI  - Variants of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in black and white South African patients with focal glomerulosclerosis and minimal change nephrotic syndrome.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and biochemical characteristics of certain alleles of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in black and white South African patients with two common types of pathology causing the nephrotic syndrome. DESIGN: A cross sectional study of black and white patients with focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) or minimal change disease (MCNS) and black and white controls. SETTING: The patients were drawn from the Paediatric Nephrology Units at the Johannesburg and Baragwanath Hospitals and the controls were drawn from the South African Blood Transfusion Service and the Paediatric Nephrology Clinic in Johannesburg. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the prevalence of the V allele in black patients with FGS (12%) as compared to black controls (1%) (p = 0.01). None of the white patients with FGS had the V allele but two out the five coloured (mixed race) patients had the V allele (20%). An increase in the prevalence of the S allele of alpha 1PI was found in white patients with FGS and MCNS (10%) as compared to white controls (2%). The plasma elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) associated with the phenotypes (PI) M1 (Ala213)S, M1 (Ala213) V, and M1 (Ala213) M1 (Ala213) was significantly decreased as compared to the EIC associated with PI M1 (Val213) M1 (Val213) (p = 0.006, p = 0.004, and p = 0.025, respectively). Twelve of 13 patients with FGS and infected with tuberculosis had either the M1 (Ala213) V or F alleles and required transplantation owing to the severity of the disease. All of these patients were either black or coloured. However, eight of 12 patients with FGS who had the M1 (Ala213) V or S alleles but were PPD negative did not require transplantation. CONCLUSION: It is possible that the combination of functionally less efficient alpha 1PI and an inflammatory challenge associated with an infection such as tuberculosis could predispose black and coloured nephrotic patients to more aggressive scarring in FGS.

TI  - Assessing abnormal rod photoreceptor activity with the a-wave of the electroretinogram: applications and methods.  
AB  - The impact of a disease on phototransduction can be assessed by fitting the leading edge of the rod a-wave to high-energy flashes with a quantitative expression. Two parameters of rod receptor activity are obtained, S (sensitivity) and Rm (maximum response). In this study, the meaning of these parameters and examples of conditions that change them were examined. In addition, a new protocol was developed for obtaining these parameters. A set of three to five white flashes were first presented in the dark and then on an adapting field (30 cd/m2). Subtracting the light-adapted responses from the dark-adapted responses yielded isolated rod a-wave responses. A clinical protocol was developed based on a single white flash energy. It is possible to determine whether a disease is producing a change in S and/or Rm with this single flash energy without the use of any equations.

TI  - Spatial scale and saccade programming.  
AB  - The global effect in eye orienting occurs when saccades land at the 'centre of gravity' of a target stimulus configuration. Short-latency saccades are particularly prone to this effect whereas longer-latency saccades may show more influence of fine detail. Alternative explanations of these effects are considered and data are presented from an experiment in which the influence of different stimulus features on the global effect in a search task was examined. The effect shows a substantially different time course for target-distractor combinations differing in contrast polarity (black vs white) than for combinations differing in shape (circle vs square). It is concluded that the global effect cannot be explained either as a high-level strategic effect or as an effect of automatic fast processing of low-spatial-frequency information in early sensory channels. Instead it is suggested that the visual-spatial-integration characteristic of the global effect is an integral and unavoidable part of the process of selection of saccadic response.

TI  - Body weight change and carotid artery wall thickness. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.  
AB  - The impact of weight change in adulthood on cardiovascular disease is controversial. This study examined the association of change in body weight, from young adulthood to middle age, with average carotid artery intimal-medial wall thickness by B-mode ultrasound measured in middle age. Participants were 13,282 men and women aged 45-64 years from the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (1987-1989). Weight change was calculated as the difference between weight at the baseline examination and self-reported weight at age 25. White men gained a mean of 9.7 kg; black men, 10.1 kg; white women, 12.0 kg; and black women, 20.8 kg. Weight change was positively, albeit modestly, associated with intimal-medial thickness in black men and white men and in white women, but not in black women. Adjusted for age, examination center, smoking, education, sports activity level, height, and body mass index at age 25, the differences in intimal-medial thickness associated with a 10-kg increment in weight change were 0.016 (95% confidence interval 0.010 to 0.022) mm in white men, 0.008 (95% confidence interval 0.001 to 0.015) mm in black men, 0.013 (95% confidence interval 0.009 to 0.017) mm in white women, and 0.002 (95% confidence interval -0.002 to 0.006) mm in black women. These findings support the hypothesis that weight gain in adulthood promotes atherosclerotic changes in white men and women and in black men.

TI  - A model for prelingual deafness, the congenitally deaf white cat--population statistics and degenerative changes.  
AB  - Cochlear implantation in congenitally deaf children leads to electrical stimulation of an entirely naive central auditory system. In this case, processes of central auditory maturation are induced by the electric stimuli. For the study of these processes the deaf white cat (DWC) appears to be an appropriate model. However, a knowledge of the basic data of these animals is necessary before such a model may be used. This paper presents these data and is one of a series of publications concerning congenital deafness in children and cochlear implantation. In our strain 72% of the animals are totally deaf as judged by the absence of any brain stem evoked potentials at click intensities up to 120 dB SPL peak equivalent. Primarily, there is a degeneration of the entire organ of Corti during the first postnatal weeks. An absence of acoustically evoked brain stem responses in the early postnatal weeks shows that DWCs probably never have any hearing experience. Months after the degeneration of the organ of Corti, the spiral ganglion starts to degenerate from the midportion of the cochlea. However, even in adult cats (2 years), a sufficient number of functionally intact auditory afferents remain, which are suitable for electrical cochlear stimulation.

TI  - Litter, permanent environmental, ram-flock, and genetic effects on early weight gain of lambs.  
AB  - Twelve models were fitted to early growth data of two Swiss sheep breeds to investigate their suitability for evaluation of breeding values. Models were identical for fixed parity, litter size, sex and lambing season effects, random flock-year, and direct genetic effects but differed for combinations of random litter, permanent environmental, ram-flock, and maternal genetic effects. Records of average daily gain to 30 d of 25,564 lambs of the Black-Brown Mountain Sheep (SBS) and of 26,391 lambs of the White Alpine Sheep (WAS) born 1989 to 1995 and their pedigrees were available. A single-trait animal model was fitted by the restricted maximum likelihood method. The information criterion of a particular model (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood function adjusted for the number of independently estimated parameters) was used to evaluate the models for their fitting power. The litter effect accounted for between 26 and 31% of the phenotypic variance, with little variation within breed. Models containing the ram-flock effect provided a better fit of the data than otherwise identical models. This effect contributed 6 and 4% to the phenotypic variance in the two breeds and strongly influenced estimates of other components. The proportion of phenotypic variance due to the flock-year effect was 23 and 25% without and 19 and 23% including the ram-flock effect in the model in the two breeds. Including permanent environmental effect of the ewe in addition to litter effect led to a better fit of the data. Depending on the model, it then contributed between 3 and 6% to the phenotypic variance. Fitting the ram-flock effect reduced heritability considerably and increased the breed difference of the estimates of this parameter. Estimates ranging from .16 to .10 and from .08 to .14 were obtained for the SBS and WAS breeds, respectively. For models without the ram-flock effect, negative estimates of the direct-maternal correlation of between -.38 and -.45 were observed. Including the ram-flock effect reduced this correlation substantially to between -.08 and -.17. Including the direct-maternal covariance in addition to the ram-flock effect did not improve the fit any further in either breed. Ranking of the models investigated differed between breeds, but the same model provided the best fit. It contained the random litter, permanent environmental, ram-flock, direct, and maternal genetic effects, but not the covariance between the last two.

AB  - This paper compares rural and urban youth cigarette-smoking behavior using the Monitoring the Future data set, a national, probability-based, multi-stage sample design. Cigarette smoking was examined by region, race, and gender over time. Results indicated that rural White males smoked more often (30-day prevalence of 34%) than any other group. Urban Black males smoked the least (10%). Urban White females smoked more (30-day prevalence of 33%) than urban Black females (7%). In general, rural and urban Whites reported smoking at significantly higher rates than rural and urban Blacks. Smoking rates declined steadily for both rural and urban Black females and urban Black males over the study period. These data document distinctive patterns of tobacco use among the nation's youth, which can be used by program planners for specific targeted interventions.

TI  - The post-larval development of lateral musculature in gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata (L.) and sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (L.).  
AB  - Fibre-type differentiation of lateral musculature has been studied in gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata (L.) and sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (L.) during post-larval development using ultrastructural, histochemical and morphometric techniques. The study showed three muscle layers: red, intermediate (or pink) and white. Initially, most of the red muscle showed low myosin ATPase (m-ATPase) activity fibres, whereas near the transverse septum some small high m-ATPase activity fibres appeared and later acquired a rosette aspect. Afterwards, during adult growth the red muscle showed a histochemical mosaic appearance. The pink muscle in sea bass was observed at the beginning of juvenile development by the oxidative technique (NADH-RT reaction) whereas in gilthead sea bream it was also observed at the end of larval development. The pink layer consists of high m-ATPase activity fibres. However, along the muscle development other low and moderate m-ATPase activity fibres were observed close to the red and white muscles, respectively.  The white muscle of juvenile fish showed a histochemical mosaic appearance near the pink muscle. In adult specimens the mosaic white muscle spread out occupying the whole of the myotome. Morphometric analysis shows a significant increase in mean fibre diameter during post-larval development, as shown by the Student's t-test (hypertrophic growth). Skewness and kurtosis values of fibre diameters point to the generation of a new fibres from the myosatellite cells (hyperplastic growth).

He had been treated with a daily dose of 30mg prednisolone for 2 months. These lesions had appeared a month before his visit. The histopathological findings revealed dermal abscesses containing hyphal structures, lymphocytes, histiocytes and giant cells. Grocott-Methenamine stain demonstrated abundant fungal elements. In culture, colonies grow rapidly and produce a white, cottony mycelium which later becomes gray in color. Microscopically, ovoid and pyriform conidia are produced at the ends of long slender conidiophores. On PCA agar, synnemata with small conidal heads developed at 37 degrees C but cleistothecia did not appear. The patient did not respond to itraconazole therapy, however, with hyperthermic treatment, the eruptions gradually healed. Based on these findings, this fungal infection was diagnosed as pseudallescheriosis.

TI  - Analysis of T cell receptor V alpha polymorphisms in rheumatoid arthritis.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test for association of T cell receptor (TCR) V alpha polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in British and Swiss white populations. METHODS: TCRAV polymorphisms were analysed in RA patients and controls by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Associations were sought between defined genotypes and RA, and the effect of HLA-DR4 status analysed. Putative associations were then retested further in new groups of patients and controls. Overall, 360 RA patients and 197 controls were studied. RESULTS: No association between TCRAV5S1, V6S1, V8S1, V17S1 or V21S1 polymorphisms and RA were observed in the initial population screened. Stratification for DR4 status showed an increase of V5S1*01/*01 in DR4 positive versus DR4 negative patients (chi 2 = 7.19, p = 0.028 (2df), p = 0.14 after correction for multiple comparisons). This putative association was tested in three further patient groups, none of which showed significant increase of V5S1*01/*01 in DR4 positive patients, although an overall trend towards an increase in V5S1*01/*01 was observed. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for a strong association of TCRAV genes and RA in a white population. However, these results suggest a weak association of V5S1*01/*01 with DR4 positive RA, although this requires confirmation using larger groups of patients and controls.

AB  - Dental services utilization in the past 12 months was compared across population-based samples of African-American, Navajo, Lakota, Hispanic, and White adults participating in the WHO International Collaborative Study of Oral Health Outcomes (ICS-II) at USA research locations. Bivariate results revealed that ethnic minority groups in both age cohorts reported significantly fewer dental visits in the past 12 months compared with White adults. When dentate status was controlled for, age cohort differences were not significant in Baltimore (African-American and White) and San Antonio (Hispanic and White) research locations. In contrast, older Native Americans (65-74 years) reported visiting the dentist significantly less often compared with their middle-aged (35-44 years) counterparts. Multivariate results indicated that generalizable variables were associated with dental contact in every ICS-II USA ethnic group (i.e., dentate, usual source of dental care, oral pain). Among the diverse ethnic groups, other determinants presented a varied pattern of risk factors for underutilizing dental care. Information on ethnic-specific risk factors can be used to design culturally appropriate and acceptable oral health promotion programs. Generalizable risk factors across ethnic groups inform oral health policy-makers about changing national priorities for promoting oral health.

TI  - An investigation into the use of thermorheology and texture analysis in the evaluation of W/O creams stabilized with a silicone emulsifier.  
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate a range of W/O semisolid emulsion systems (creams) containing white soft paraffin (petrolatum) and a new type of nonionic lipophilic silicone emulsifier (Abil EM 90) using a novel combination of rheological tests. Emulsifier concentrations from 1.5% to 3.0% w/w were used with two manufacturing procedures, cold (25 degrees C) and warm (70 degrees C) emulsification, to determine whether and to what extent these variables alter the structure and consistency of the creams. The techniques comprised linear (continuous flow) and dynamic (oscillatory) rheometry at 25 degrees C, thermal flow experiments (from 10 degrees to 90 degrees C and back to 10 degrees C), and penetrometry studies. The differences in emulsifier concentration produced effects on the rheological properties of the W/ O creams, although the manufacturing process was much more influential. Cold emulsification led to creams with higher viscosity, lower thixotropy, and better elastic properties. The results of penetration tests on creams correlated with those of the rheological studies. The flow properties of white soft paraffin at 25 degrees C were comparable with the creams obtained by cold emulsification, while the elasticity was considerably lower. Thermorheological studies showed evidence for transitional behavior for white soft paraffin on heating, but not for the creams. White soft paraffin showed a higher viscosity (and resistance to the penetrating force) when melted at 70 degrees C and left to solidify at room temperature, compared to the "unmelted" sample. This was the opposite trend to that found with warm and cold emulsified creams. The input of heat during the emulsification process showed a strong effect on the structure and consistency of the W/O creams containing petrolatum and silicone emulsifier, resulting in a less viscous product. The use of the aforementioned techniques represents a useful and novel approach to the evaluation of cream consistency.

TI  - Brown fat is essential for cold-induced thermogenesis but not for obesity resistance in aP2-Ucp mice.  
AB  - The role of brown adipose tissue in total energy balance and cold-induced thermogenesis was studied. Mice expressing mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) from the fat-specific aP2 gene promoter (heterozygous and homozygous aP2-Ucp transgenic mice) and their nontransgenic C57BL6/J littermates were used. The transgenic animals are resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet, presumably due to ectopic synthesis of UCP-1 in white fat. These animals exhibited atrophy of brown adipose tissue, as indicated by smaller size of brown fat and reduction of its total UCP-1 and DNA contents. Norepinephrine-induced respiration (measured in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized animals) was decreased proportionally to the dosage of the transgene, and the homozygous (but not heterozygous) transgenic mice exhibited a reduction in their capacity to maintain body temperature in the cold. Our results indicate that the role of brown fat in cold-induced thermogenesis cannot be substituted by increased energy expenditure in other tissues.

TI  - Prevalence of PTSD in a community sample of older adolescents.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine prevalence and correlates of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and diagnosis in older adolescents aged 16 through 22 years. METHOD: The second cycle of a longitudinal epidemiological study in the Southeast included a semistructured interview assessing PTSD symptomatology administered to 490 adolescents. RESULTS: Approximately 3% of female subjects and 1% of male subjects satisfied the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. Females reported more traumatic events than males, and black subjects reported more events than white subjects. Being female (odds ratio = 12.32), experiencing rape or child sexual abuse (odds ratio = 49.37), and witnessing an accident or medical emergency (odds ratio = 85.02) were associated with increased risk of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: While relatively few adolescents satisfy the criteria for PTSD, most subjects who experienced a traumatic event reported some PTSD symptoms. Specific types of traumatic events were associated with occurrence of PTSD.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth: a comprehensive review of the literature.  
AB  - Preterm low birth weight is the major determinant of infant morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies have linked bacterial vaginosis (BV) with preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW), especially among black women. This article reviews the published literature to provide clear evidence that BV is an independent risk factor for preterm birth and LBW. Pregnant black women are especially at risk, having nearly three times the level of BV as pregnant white women. Compounding the problem is the fact that half the population of women with BV are asymptomatic, and current standard antenatal procedures do not provide for screening for BV. By reviewing BV treatment literature, this article also provides evidence that treatment for BV is effective and that the identification and treatment of BV in pregnant women can lead to substantial reduction in the high rates of preterm birth and LBW.

TI  - The association of radiographically detected vertebral fractures with back pain and function: a prospective study.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebral fractures are a hallmark of postmenopausal osteoporosis and an important end point in trials of osteoporosis treatment, but the clinical significance of these fractures remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of new vertebral fractures with back pain and back-related functional limitation in older women. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Multicenter Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. PARTICIPANTS: 7223 white women aged 65 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: Lateral spine radiographs were obtained at baseline and at a follow-up examination an average of 3.7 years later. Prevalent and incident radiographic vertebral fractures were assessed by quantitative morphometry. Frequency and severity of back pain, disability in doing six activities involving the back, and days of bed rest and days of limited activity due to back pain were assessed annually by questionnaire during follow-up. RESULTS: Among women without a vertebral fracture at baseline, those with at least one incident vertebral fracture were more likely to have increased back pain (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3]) and back disability (OR, 2.6 [CI, 1.9 to 3.7]) and at least 1 day of bed rest due to back pain (OR, 6.7 [CI, 4.4 to 10.2]) and 7 days of limited activity due to back pain per year (OR, 3.8 [CI, 2.7 to 5.0]). Among women with a fracture at baseline, those with an incident vertebral fracture also had a greater risk for increased back pain (OR, 2.0 [CI, 1.4 to 2.8]) and back disability (OR, 2.2 [CI, 1.5 to 3.1]) and at least 1 day of bed rest (OR, 7.9 [CI, 4.9 to 12.9]) and 7 days of limited activity per year (OR, 3.5 [CI, 2.4 to 5.0]). Women with incident fracture had about 10 additional limited-activity days and 1 to 2 days of bed rest per year. New vertebral fractures that did not come to medical attention were associated with increased back pain and functional limitation. CONCLUSION: New vertebral fractures, even those not recognized clinically, are associated with substantial increases in back pain and functional limitation due to back pain in older white women. Prevention of new vertebral fractures should reduce the burden of back pain and functional limitation in women with vertebral osteoporosis.

TI  - Blood pressure monitoring in diabetic pregnancy.  
AB  - Hypertensive disorders which complicate 5-10% of all pregnancies are more frequent in diabetic women. We longitudinally monitored blood pressure (BP) for a 24 h period in 54 diabetic out patients, at each trimester of pregnancy, in order to observe the relationship between the blood pressure behaviour and the main clinical features of these subjects. A relationship was found between blood pressure and the diabetes type. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) women, the age of diagnosis and the diabetes duration played the major role whereas, in non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) women only the patients' age was correlated with the BP levels. Higher BP levels were found in women belonging to the White class D, and whose diabetes duration was more than 10 years. An interesting correlation was also demonstrated between BP and insulin requirement, in late pregnancy as well as the time of delivery. Early in pregnancy, BP levels, even if within normal range, were undoubtedly higher in those women who developed hypertension compared to those who continued to be normotensive. Daytime BP values were always found higher than night-time BP values but, the physiological biorhythm seemed to be altered at the end of pregnancy.

TI  - Prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in Hispanics is similar to Caucasians.  
AB  - Barrett's esophagus (BE) is considered to be a disease of white males with a prevalence ranging from 0.5 to 4.0% in patients undergoing upper endoscopy (EGD) for any indication, and from 12 to 15% in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The prevalence of BE in Hispanics is not known, but it is assumed to be lower. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of BE in Hispanic patients and to compare demographic and endoscopic characteristics with Caucasian patients with BE. Records of patients undergoing an EGD between October 1993 and October 1996 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in the study only if they had columnar-appearing esophageal mucosa at endoscopy and intestinal metaplasia with Alcian blue-staining goblet cells on biopsy. An extensive chart review was performed in patients with BE. There were 75 new cases of BE discovered: 60 (80%) were Caucasians, 6 (8%) Hispanics, 1 (1.4%) Native American, and 8 (10.6%) patients with either unknown or unconfirmed ethnicity. Of the 75 patients, 74 male, and the mean age was 65 +/- 11.4 years (range 36-92 years). The prevalence of BE in Caucasians and Hispanics undergoing EGD for any reason was similar (5.3% and 3.8%, respectively, P = 0.563). The prevalence of BE in patients presenting with GERD symptoms was also similar between Caucasians and Hispanics (25% and 16%, respectively, P = 0.304). The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, symptoms, habits, or endoscopic findings. In conclusion, the prevalence of BE among Hispanic patients is similar to Caucasian patients, an unexpected finding.

TI  - Predicting high blood pressure in pregnancy: a multivariate approach [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia in 212 nulliparous women before 20 weeks' gestation and at approximately 28 weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, prospective study in a teaching hospital. We performed standardized measurements of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures, body mass index, urinary calcium:creatinine ratio and components of the renin-angiotensin system, including platelet angiotensin II binding site density. Attending clinicians were blinded to the results. Outcome was assessed by one observer at the end of pregnancy. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify significant predictors. RESULTS: Fifty-five women had transient, presumed 'white-coat', systolic hypertension at the time of first pregnancy visit; they were twice as likely to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia and five times more likely to deliver prematurely. Body mass index, platelet angiotensin II binding site density and urinary calcium:creatinine ratio measured before 20 weeks gestation were also significant predictors. At 28 weeks of pregnancy, measurements of the blood pressure were significant predictors (reflecting the near clinical expression of the disease), together with the plasma angiotensinogen concentration. CONCLUSIONS: A single systolic blood pressure reading of 140 mmHg or more before 20 weeks' gestation indicates a higher than normal risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia and premature delivery. Discriminator biochemical variables were also identified at this time, which might allow the more rational use of prophylactic measures.

TI  - The conjoint trait of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides in adolescent black and white males.  
AB  - To evaluate the interrelationships among body composition, blood pressure, and lipid phenotypes in adolescent black and white boys, we assessed racial distributions of lipids, blood pressure, and obesity and their joint occurrence in black and white boys aged 10 to 15 years. Subjects were recruited from Cincinnati (OH) schools. Because the differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs) are the most profound coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor differences between black and white males, we assigned subjects to one of four low-HDL-C and high-TG categories (normal and increased risk) using the age/race-specific 25th (HDL-C) and 75th (TG) percentiles. We then assessed racial distributions of lipids, blood pressure, and obesity by these phenotypes. Age differences between the black and white participants were significant, with the former about 3 months younger (P=.03), but black boys were more mature and were significantly taller and heavier and had a greater body mass index ([BMI] weight in kilograms divided by height in centimeters squared). Differences in the sum of the triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds were not significant. Blacks had significantly higher HDL-C, lower TG, and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) were not significant. In both racial groups, the body composition measures were significantly correlated with HDL-C, TG, and blood pressure levels; the correlations between HDL-C and both weight and BMI were significantly stronger in white boys. The proportion of boys of each race with low HDL-C and high TG was similar by design. In both racial groups, subjects with the conjoint trait had a significantly greater BMI, triceps skinfold, and sum of skinfolds than subjects in the other phenotypic groups. For white boys, participants with the conjoint trait had the highest SBP and DBP; differences in SBP were significant for comparisons to the normal- and high-TG group alone, and differences in DBP were significant for the comparison between normal and low HDL-C alone. For black boys, subjects with both normal HDL-C and TG had significantly lower SBP than boys with either the conjoint trait or high TG alone; none of the group differences in DBP were significant. Black had significantly less dense LDL (more LDL-C per apolipoprotein [apo] B). In each racial group, boys with the conjoint trait had the most dense LDL, significantly more dense than in any of the other phenotypes in black boys and significantly more dense than in boys with low HDL-C alone and normal boys in the white group. In both racial groups, the occurrence of no risk factors (>75th percentile TG, BMI, SBP, and DBP or <25th percentile HDL-C) and three or more risk factors was greater than expected by chance alone, and the occurrence of exactly one risk factor and two factors was less. When examined by phenotypic groups within race, boys in each racial group with the normal phenotype had a greater than expected percentage with no risk factors, and white boys with the conjoint trait were more likely to have a marked increase in multiple risk factors. Possible mechanisms for this clustering of risk factors and for the racial differences in the patterns are discussed.

TI  - Otoacoustic emission and auditory efferent function testing in patients with sensori-neural hearing loss.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of otoacoustic emissions and auditory efferent system function in evaluating auditory functional status in both normal and diseased conditions. METHODS: Spontaneous and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and efferent function in terms of contralateral white noise induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppressions were tested and cross compared in 32 normal ears, 24 ears with cochlear hearing loss and 16 ears with retrocochlear hearing loss. RESULTS: Transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude and contralateral suppression, spontaneous otoacoustic emission incidence, peaks and frequency range were significantly reduced in cochlear hearing loss while in retrocochlear hearing loss transient evoked otoacoustic emission and spontaneous otoacoustic emission levels were significantly higher than in cochlear hearing loss group and showed no suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral acoustic stimulation induced transient evoked otoacoustic emission suppression as an index of efferent function is clinically feasible. Combined otoacoustic emission and efferent tests are of great significance in evaluating cochlea status and auditory central mechanisms. Auditory efferent function is weakened in cochlear lesions and severely damaged in retrocochlear lesions.

TI  - Differential effect of race on the axial and appendicular skeletons of children [see comments]  
AB  - The prevalence of osteoporosis and the incidence of fractures are substantially lower in black than in white subjects, a finding generally attributed to racial differences in adult bone mass. Whether these racial differences are present in childhood is the subject of considerable interest, as the amount of bone gained during growth is a major determinant of future susceptibility to fractures. We measured the density and size of the vertebrae and femurs of 80 black and 80 white healthy children, 8-18 yr of age, matched for age, gender, height, weight, and stage of sexual development, using computed tomography. Race had a significant and differential effect on the bones in the axial and appendicular skeletons. In the axial skeleton, black children had greater cancellous bone density, but similar cross-sectional area of the vertebral bodies. In contrast, in the appendicular skeleton, black children had greater femoral cross-sectional area, but similar cortical bone area and cortical bone density. Compared to white children, vertebral bone density and femoral cross-sectional area at sexual maturity were, on the average, 10.75% and 5.7% higher, respectively, in black children. Such significant variations may contribute to the racial differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis between black and white adults.

TI  - Augmented post-induction therapy for children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a slow response to initial therapy [see comments]  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have a slow response to initial chemotherapy (more than 25 percent blasts in the bone marrow on day 7) have a poor outcome despite intensive therapy. We conducted a randomized trial in which such patients were treated with either an augmented intensive regimen of post-induction chemotherapy or a standard regimen of intensive post-induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Between January 1991 and June 1995, 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were either 1 to 9 years of age with white-cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter or 10 years of age or older, had a slow response to initial therapy, and entered remission at the end of induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (156 children) or augmented therapy (155). Those with lymphomatous features were excluded. Event-free survival and overall survival were assessed from the end of induction treatment. RESULTS: The outcome at five years was significantly better in the augmented-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival [+/-SD]: 75.0+/-3.8 vs. 55.0+/-4.5 percent, P<0.001; overall survival: 78.4+/-3.7 vs. 66.7+/-4.2 percent, P=0.02). The difference between treatments was most pronounced among patients one to nine years of age, all of whom had white-cell counts of at least 50,000 per cubic millimeter (P<0.001). Risk factors for an adverse event in the entire cohort included a white-cell count of 200,000 per cubic millimeter or higher (P=0.004), race other than black or white (P<0.001), and the presence of a t(9;22) translocation (P=0.007). The toxic effects of augmented therapy were considerable but manageable. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented post-induction chemotherapy results in an excellent outcome for most patients with high-risk ALL and a slow response to initial therapy.

TI  - Cigarette smoking as a determinant of high-grade carotid artery stenosis in Hispanic, black, and white patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack.  
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to investigate the association of cigarette smoking with high-grade carotid artery stenosis in Hispanic, black, and white patients with cerebral ischemia in two independent samples. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study (NOMASS) (n=431) and the Berlin Cerebral Ischemia Databank (BCID) (n=483) were used separately for a cross-sectional study estimating the association between cigarette smoking and high-grade carotid stenosis (defined as a luminal narrowing of > or =60%, diagnosed by duplex and/or Doppler ultrasound). In both studies, cerebral ischemia patients with normal sonographic findings or nonstenosing plaques of their carotid arteries served as a comparison group. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for statistical tests to determine the association between smoking and the dependent variable for high-grade carotid stenosis. Age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and race/ethnicity were considered potential confounders. Further analyses of the NOMASS data estimated the effect of the amount of cigarette use and the impact of race/ethnicity. RESULTS: High-grade carotid stenoses were found in 14% of the NOMASS and in 21% of the Berlin patients. In Berlin the entire sample was white, whereas in New York only 19% of the cohort were white. In both samples, smoking was independently associated with severe carotid stenosis (NOMASS: odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.0; BCID: OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.4 to 6.4). Patients smoking 20 pack-years or more showed a significant association (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.9), whereas no significant effect was found for lower amounts of cigarette use. In NOMASS, white smokers displayed a significant (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 8.9) association with high-grade carotid stenosis, the association for black smokers was less strong, and no association was found among Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is an independent determinant of severe carotid artery stenosis in patients with focal cerebral ischemia. The association differs by race/ethnicity, with the greatest effect observed among whites.

TI  - Urinary excretion of catecholamines, cortisol and their metabolites in Meishan and large white sows: validation as a non-invasive and integrative assessment of adrenocortical and sympathoadrenal axis activity.  
AB  - Urinary free corticoids (cortisol and cortisone), catecholamines (norepinephrine or NE, epinephrine or E, dopamine or DA, and their O-methoxylated metabolites) as well as creatinine (Cr) were analysed in 42 spontaneously voided urine samples from Large White (LW, n = 20), Meishan (MS, n = 6), and LW x MS (F1, n = 16) lactating sows. The cortisol concentration in the urine of MS (28.1 pg/micrograms Cr) was five-fold greater than that of LW sows (6.2 pg/micrograms Cr, P < 10(-4)). F1 were intermediate (12.0 pg/micrograms Cr). Mean cortisone concentration was also larger in MS (13.5 pg/micrograms Cr) compared to LW (7.1 pg/micrograms Cr, P < 0.01). Although the differences were less pronounced, the concentrations of the catecholamines were also greater in MS than in LW sows (norepinephrine: 25.4 versus 5.9 pg/micrograms Cr, epinephrine: 8.7 versus 2.8 pg/micrograms Cr and dopamine: 59.2 versus 17.8 pg/micrograms Cr, P < 10(-4)). These results confirmed the hypercortisolism state of MS pigs previously shown by plasma cortisol assay and supported the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive in this breed. These urinary investigations may offer possible applications for the assessment of chronic stress.

TI  - Discordance between ultrasound of the calcaneus and bone mineral density in black and white women.  
AB  - Black women have 40% of the incidence rate for hip fracture and have a higher bone mineral density (BMD) than white women. The possibility was raised that bone quality may be disproportionately greater than the advantage in bone density in protection against osteoporotic fractures in black versus white women. Ultrasound (US) of the calcaneus is believed to measure properties of bone in addition to its density. We performed bone density measurements and US of the calcaneus in 108 black and 177 healthy white women, aged 20-70 years. The highest correlation was seen between total body bone density and speed of sound (r = 0.75). The interracial differences in BMD were all statistically significant and varied from 3.4 to 7.6%. The US measurements had lesser interracial differences than the bone density measurements, with velocity barely different between races. These findings suggest that US of the calcaneus measures properties of bone different from density. Fracture prediction data using US from prospective data in white women should not be extrapolated to black women because of the discordance between bone density and US measurements. Prospective studies are needed comparing US measurements in black women to the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.

TI  - Paratubal cysts in young females as an incidental finding in laparotomies performed for right lower quadrant abdominal pain.  
AB  - Paratubal cysts represent remnants of the paramesonephric or mesonephric duct, the former being more common. Most of them are asymptomatic, but they may rarely give rise to clinical problems due to enlargement or torsion. In this study, we looked for paratubal cysts or other pathological lesions of the right uterine adnexa in young females operated upon for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain. Our material consisted of 338 white female patients aged 4-14 years. Laparotomy revealed only acute appendicitis in 283 cases, while 44 had acute appendicitis plus a coincidental paratubal cyst. Most of these cysts were smaller than 1 cm in diameter. However, 2 additional cases had torsion of a large paratubal cyst, while 5 had a ruptured corpus luteum. We suggest that a thorough search of the right adnexa for the presence of paratubal cysts during laparotomies performed for RLQ pain is a useful procedure. This approach also allows detection of other pathological lesions of the right adnexa that often produce symptoms similar to acute appendicitis.

TI  - Influence of diabetes during pregnancy on gestational age-specific newborn weight among US black and US white infants.  
AB  - This study examined the impact of maternal diabetes on birth weight for gestational age patterns of all term black infants and white infants in the United States using data derived from the 1990-1991 US Live Birth File of the National Center for Health Statistics. Infants of both black mothers and white mothers exhibited the expected fetal overgrowth associated with maternal diabetes. However, the increase in birth weight was much greater in infants of black than white diabetic mothers in comparison with their nondiabetic counterparts, as measured by the discrepancy in birth weight between infants of diabetic and nondiabetic mothers at each gestational week, the incidence of large for gestational age, high birth weight, small for gestational age, and low birth weight. After adjustment for maternal hypertension, prenatal care use, and sociodemographic factors, the disparity in mean birth weight associated with diabetes was 211.67 g in black infants and 115.74 g in white infants. The adjusted odds ratios of birth weight > or = 4,000 g were 2.98 (95% confidence interval 2.89-3.12) for black infants and 1.83 (95% confidence interval 1.78-1.89) for white infants. Given the potential risks for mothers and infants consequent to maternal diabetes and fetal hyperinsulinemia, further investigation of the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of diabetes during pregnancy among black mothers and infants is warranted.

TI  - Sarcoidosis with orbital tumor outside the lacrimal gland: initial manifestation in 2 elderly white women.  
AB  -  Two elderly white women (aged 72 and 87 years) were first seen with painless, unilateral orbital swelling. Orbital scanning revealed masses infiltrating the soft tissue around the eye. Biopsy results showed nodular, noncaseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. One patient's workup revealed systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis at the time of examination with hilar lymphadenopathy noted on gallium scan; the other refused a complete systemic workup. The orbital tumors resolved with systemic prednisone therapy. To our knowledge, our 87-year-old patient is the oldest to be seen with orbital sarcoidosis. These 2 patients demonstrate that this diagnosis must be considered with orbital tumors in the elderly and in unusual locations, such as these which occurred outside the lacrimal gland.

TI  - Simultaneous involvement of thyroid by Riedel's [correction of Reidel's] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a case report [published erratum appears in Thyroid 1998 Aug;8(8):736]  
AB  - We report an unusual thyroid lesion showing histologic features of both Riedel's [corrected] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a 57-year-old white female. The clinical presentation was hypothyroidism associated with a solitary firm to hard cold nodule replacing the entire right lobe of thyroid gland. Pathological examination demonstrated extensive replacement of the thyroid parenchyma with dense keloidal fibrosis, intermixed well-developed lymphoid follicles, scattered lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The fibrotic process extended into the perithyroidal soft tissues and skeletal muscle with complete obliteration of the thyroid capsule. These findings were consistent with Riedel's [corrected] disease. However, the immunohistochemical stains for B and T markers and immunoglobulin light chains showed an immunoprofile consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This combination of Riedel's [corrected] disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis is rare and coincidental, as both represent two distinct clinicopathological entities.

TI  - An in vitro comparison between laser fluorescence and visual examination for detection of demineralization in occlusal pits and fissures.  
AB  - It has been demonstrated that when excited by laser light carious enamel appears dark compared to luminescent sound enamel. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of visual exams (V), laser fluorescence (LF) and dye-enhanced LF (DELF) for detecting demineralization in occlusal pits and fissures. The actual presence of lesions was determined by subsequent confocal laser microscopy (CM), which was compared to histology (H). Independent clinical examiners visually graded three sites on occlusal surfaces of extracted, human premolars as sound or carious and also rated the color of each graded site as: 0 = same as surrounding enamel; 1 = white; 2 = light brown, or 3 = brown/dark brown. An argon laser was used to illuminate the teeth for LF and DELF; the images were captured with a CCD camera and then analyzed. DELF images were captured after the teeth had been exposed to 0.075% sodium fluorescein. Sections were then cut from each specimen and analyzed by CM and H for the presence or absence of caries. Results showed that DELF (0.72) was significantly more sensitive (p<0.05) than LF (0.49) and V (0.03) for detecting caries, but there were no significant differences among the methods in specificity (V 1.00; LF 0.67; DELF 0.60). When color was used as an indication of caries in V (VC, sensitivity 0.47; specificity 0.70), V exams were not different from LF. The area under the ROC curve, using H as the gold standard and CM as the test, was 0.78. Results indicated that DELF was the best diagnostic tool and that VC and LF were equally effective as diagnostic methods, when color of fissures was included as an indication of demineralization in the visual exam.

TI  - Comparison of existing skinfold equations for estimating body fat in African American and white women.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare seven skinfold equations with underwater weighing (UWW) for estimating body fat in 39 African American [age: 22.8 +/- 3.6 y (x +/- SD); weight: 59.6 +/- 8.3 kg) and 39 white (age: 22.1 +/- 2.9 y; weight: 61.7 +/- 7.3 kg) women. The hypothesis examined was that the equations would produce more accurate body fat estimates in white women, but would be appropriate for use in African American women. Body fat estimated from two quadratic, three linear, and two logarithmic skinfold equations was compared with body fat estimated from UWW; the same procedures were used to evaluate the results in both African Americans and whites. The data were analyzed by using t tests, analysis of variance, Scheffe's honestly significant difference tests, correlations, error assessments, and agreement. The results showed that total error, SEE, and SD values were larger in the African American women than in the white women and were not within acceptable limits listed in the literature. The correlation coefficients were lower in the African American women than in the white women. Agreement between the skinfold equations and UWW, based on deviations from mean differences, was better in the white women. In conclusion, the skinfold prediction equations evaluated in this study were more variable and produced more error when used in African American women. Therefore, population-specific equations for African American women should be used to estimate body fat because they will probably yield more accurate estimates.

TI  - In vivo comparison of the biocompatibility of two root canal sealers implanted into the subcutaneous connective tissue of rats.  
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of Apexit (a calcium hydroxide) and Pulp Canal Sealer (a classic zinc oxide-eugenol), root canal sealers, after implantation in rat connective tissue.  Forty-four white female Wistar-Furth rats were used. Each sealer was placed in Teflon tubes and implanted into specific dorsal subdermal tissues sites. Implants were removed after 5, 15, 60, and 120 days; fixed; and histologically prepared for microscopical evaluation. Severe inflammatory reactions with differing extensions of necrosis were observed with Apexit on the 5th and 15th days. The intensity of the reaction had diminished by the 60th day, and this reduction continued progressively through the 120th day. It was characterized by the presence of connective tissue with a few macrophages. Moderate to severe inflammation with confined areas of necrosis was observed in the Pulp Canal Sealer specimens on the 5th day. The intensity of the reaction diminished by the 15th, 60th, and 120th days, but remained slightly greater than Apexit through longterm observation periods.

TI  - Predictors of participation in prostate cancer screening at worksites.  
AB  - Unfortunately, African American men have a higher incidence of and a higher mortality rate for prostate cancer than White men but are less likely to participate in prostate cancer screening. This correlational survey research identifies predictors for participation in a free prostate cancer screening in 179 men, 64% of whom are African American. Each man was invited to see his personal physician for a free prostate cancer screening following a prostate cancer educational program given at his worksite. Forty-seven percent of the African American men went to their personal physician following the educational program and received a digital rectal examination (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. In the original cohort of educational program attendees, only 16% of the African Americans had obtained a DRE in the previous 12 months. However, 44% subsequently did participate in free DRE screening. Similarly, only 6% of the African American men had received a PSA screening in the previous 12 months, yet 42% obtained a PSA screening after the educational program, a sevenfold increase. Implications for allocating limited resources for education and screening to the high-risk group of African American men are discussed. This study's model of a prostate cancer educational program at worksites followed by attendees visiting their personal physician for screening could be replicated throughout the United States to increase African American men's participation in prostate cancer screening.

TI  - Predictors of outcome in emphysematous pyelonephritis.  
AB  - PURPOSE: We identified and quantified prognostic factors for emphysematous pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical information, laboratory data and radiological findings from 38 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the nonsurvivor and survivor groups with respect to age, gender, diabetes mellitus history, presence of bacteremia, identity of infecting organisms, blood glucose level, leukocyte count, urinary white blood count, presence or absence of urinary tract obstruction or urolithiasis, and modes of treatment. There were significant differences between the nonsurvivor and survivor groups, however, with respect to platelet count (84,300 +/- 119,500 versus 220,400 +/- 161,800/mm.3, p = 0.001), serum creatinine level (3.61 +/- 1.25 versus 2.19 +/- 1.32 mg./dl., p = 0.003) and urinary red blood counts (56.47 +/- 41.86 versus 27.65 +/- 36.14, p = 0.028). Patients with radiological type I emphysematous pyelonephritis were significantly more likely to die than those with type II (69 versus 18%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Serum creatinine level is the most reliable predictor of outcome in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis. By calculating likelihood ratios, patients with creatinine levels greater than 1.4 mg./dl. and platelet counts 60,000/mm.3 or less were at high risk. The posttest probability of death increased from 69 and 18% to 92 and 53% for type I and II emphysematous pyelonephritis, respectively. Patients with creatinine levels 1.4 mg./dl. or less and platelet counts greater than 60,000/mm.3 were at much lower risk. Posttest mortality risk in these patients dropped from 69 and 18% to 27 and 4% for type I and II emphysematous pyelonephritis, respectively.

TI  - Acute illness and recovery in adult female rats following ingestion of a tooth whitener containing 6% hydrogen peroxide.  
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether ingestion of a tooth whitener containing 6% hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agent affected the gastric mucosa of adult, female laboratory rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six fasting rats were intubated with a single bolus (5 g/kg body weight) of the tooth whitener Natural White which contains 6% hydrogen peroxide. Thirty-two control rats received deionized water. Rats were necropsied 15 minutes, 2 hours, 1 and 2 weeks after whitener ingestion. The gastric mucosa was examined histologically and blood hematocrit, glucose, BUN, and bilirubin measured. RESULTS: Six of the 36 rats died within 2 hours of receiving whitener. Within 15 minutes of whitener ingestion, stomachs were grossly bloated with gas. Histological observation showed that gastric mucosal cells were vacuolated and gastric glands dilated. After 2 hours, gastric epithelial and glandular cells had sloughed off into the gastric lumen. Mean blood glucose and hematocrit were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated (233 +/- 41 mg/ml and 50.5 +/- 0.9%) over mean control values (129 +/- 8 mg/ml and 42.8 +/- 2.4%). Within 1 week, the stomachs of experimental rats were no longer bloated, the gastric mucosa appeared normal histologically, but mean blood hematocrit was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased (38.0 +/- 1.5%) from mean control value (43.3 +/- 0.5%). There were no significant differences in mean blood values 2 weeks after whitener ingestion.

TI  - Long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene and prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in smokers.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in smokers. DESIGN: An end-point examination of a random sample of participants in a controlled trial for 5-7 years (Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study) in Helsinki, Finland. SUBJECTS: A total of 409 white male cigarette smokers, aged 55-74 years who received either alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) or beta-carotene (20 mg per day) supplementation, both of these or placebo capsules. METHODS: Clinical examination of oral mucosae, histological examination of lesions showing leukoplakia and cytological examination of buccal epithelium. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the study groups either in the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions or in the cells of unkeratinized epithelium. Leukoplakia was present in 24 (5.9%) of the subjects. Seven lesions showed dysplasia. CONCLUSION: The present study on oral health does not support the hypothesis that alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation plays an essential role in preventing oral mucosal changes in smokers.

TI  - Progression of Alzheimer's disease in black and white patients: the CERAD experience, part XVI. Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease.  
AB  - We compared the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in CERAD-enrolled black and white patients, as indicated by changes in selected clinical and neuropsychology measures, over a 1-year time interval. Of 225 black and 935 white AD patients who were enrolled, 148 (66%) black and 770 (82%) white patients remained in the study. Of these, 82 black and 532 white patients provided complete in-person information on first annual re-evaluation. Overall, with age, education, initial level of performance on each measure, and stage of disease at entry controlled, race had a very mild effect on change in disease (8 df multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA], p < 0.047). Black patients showed less decline than white patients, most notably for the CERAD Boston Naming test (p < 0.02) and the third and final trial of the 10-item Word List Learning task (p < 0.003). Although unadjusted data indicate that black and white patients appear to differ notably at entry, our findings indicated that differences in progression of the dementing process are minor, suggesting that course of AD is comparable in these racial groups. Examination over a longer period is difficult because of the high attrition rate of black patients.

TI  - Ethnic and socioeconomic differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors: findings for women from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994 [see comments]  
AB  - CONTEXT: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are higher among ethnic minority women than among white women in the United States. However, because ethnic minority women are disproportionately poor, socioeconomic status (SES) may substantially explain these risk factor differences. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differences in CVD risk factors by ethnicity could be attributed to differences in SES. DESIGN: Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. SETTING: Eighty-nine mobile examination centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1762 black, 1481 Mexican American, and 2023 white women, aged 25 to 64 years, who completed both the home questionnaire and medical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ethnicity and years of education (SES) in relation to systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI, a measure of weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), physical inactivity, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C [the difference between total cholesterol and HDL-C]), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: As expected, most CVD risk factors were higher among ethnic minority women than among white women. After adjusting for years of education, highly significant differences in blood pressure, BMI, physical inactivity, and diabetes remained for both black and Mexican American women compared with white women (P<.001). In addition, women of lower SES from each of the 3 ethnic groups had significantly higher prevalences of smoking and physical inactivity and higher levels of BMI and non-HDL-C than women of higher SES (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the greatest evidence to date of higher CVD risk factors among black and Mexican American women than among white women of comparable SES. The striking differences by both ethnicity and SES underscore the critical need to improve screening, early detection, and treatment of CVD-related conditions for black and Mexican American women, as well as for women of lower SES in all ethnic groups.

TI  - Influence of race and gender on care process, resource use, and hospital-based outcomes in congestive heart failure.  
AB  - Race and gender are important determinants of certain clinical outcomes in cardiovascular disease. To examine the influence of race and gender on care process, resource use, and hospital-based case outcomes for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), we obtained administrative records on all 1995 New York State hospital discharges assigned ICD-9-CM codes indicative of this diagnosis. The following were compared among black and white women and men: demographics, comorbid illness, care processes, length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, mortality rate, and CHF readmission rate. We identified 45,894 patients (black women, 4,750; black men, 3,370; white women, 21,165; white men, 16,609). Blacks underwent noninvasive cardiac procedures more often than whites; procedure and specialty use rates were lower among women than among men. After adjusting for other patient characteristics and hospital type and location, we found race to be an important determinant of LOS (black, 10.4 days; white, 9.3 days; p = 0.0001), hospital charges (black, $13,711; white, $11,074; p = 0.0001), mortality (black-to-white odds ratio = 0.832; p = 0.003), and readmission (black-to-white odds ratio = 1.301; p = 0.0001). Gender was an important determinant of LOS (women, 9.8 days; men, 9.2 days; p = 0.0001), hospital charges (women, $11,690; men, $11,348; p = 0.02), and mortality (women-to-men odds ratio = 0.878; p = 0.0008). We conclude that race and gender influence care process and hospital-based case outcomes for patients with CHF.

TI  - L-selectin-specific autoantibodies in murine lupus: possible involvement in abnormal homing and polarization of CD4+ T cell subsets.  
AB  - One notable functional abnormality in murine and human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the defect in the production of IL-2 in association with the deficit in naive CD4+ T cells. The mechanism is unknown, but one idea is that naturally occurring autoantibodies with specificities to the naive CD4+ T cell subpopulation are related to this event. We selected hybridoma monoclonal autoantibodies from SLE-prone (New Zealand Black (NZB) x New Zealand White (NZW))F1 mice that reacted with restricted populations of CD4+ T cells. One of these, H32, was specific for L-selectin, as determined by 1) distribution of Ag H32 on lymphoid cells similar to Mel-14, an epitope of L-selectin; 2) shedding of 80-kDa molecules with epitope H32 from the surface of lymph node cells coincidentally with Mel-14, when stimulated with phorbol ester; 3) cross-inhibitory activities on Ag binding between H32 and Mel-14; and 4) reactivity of H32 with recombinant mouse L-selectin. Pretreatment of 51Cr-labeled lymphocytes from BALB/c mice with H32 significantly inhibited their homing to lymph nodes in vivo. The BALB/c splenic H32+ CD4+ T cell subset produced few cytokines except IL-2, thus corresponding to naive ThP-type cells. This subset was markedly selectively depleted in aged (NZB x NZW)F1 mice. There was an age-associated increase in frequencies and titers of anti-L-selectin autoantibodies in sera from (NZB x NZW)F1 mice. Thus, abnormalities of naive CD4+ T cell subset, including IL-2 production in subjects with SLE, are at least partly attributed to the generation of autoantibodies to L-selectin.

TI  - Prostate specific antigen and pathological features of prostate cancer in black and white patients: a comparative study based on radical prostatectomy specimens [see comments]  
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the relationship of pathological features and preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels of a consecutive series of black patients to a stage matched cohort of white patients treated during the same period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radical prostatectomy specimens of 40 black patients were reviewed and tumor volume was determined. Histopathological features (stage, grade, zonal distribution of cancer foci), tumor volume and prostate weight were correlated to pretreatment serum PSA levels. These parameters were compared with those of 148 white patients matched by pathological stage. RESULTS: Black patients exhibited a significantly higher incidence of seminal vesicle involvement (p=0.03) and cancers with a Gleason score of 8 or more (p=0.02), and a trend toward decreased pathologically organ confined, margin negative disease (40% black versus 53% white men, p=0.13). Although the incidences of multifocal cancer were virtually identical (90 and 82%) in the 2 groups, black patients exhibited a higher incidence of transition zone cancer foci (p <0.001). Mean prostate tumor volume, total gland weight and serum PSA level among black and white patients with pathological stage pT2-, pT2+ and pT3- cancer were not significantly different. However, with advancing pathological stage (pT3+ and pT3c) disease black patients had higher preoperative serum PSA levels on univariate and multivariate analyses despite similar total gland weight and tumor volume. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients who underwent radical prostatectomy often exhibited adverse pathological features. Two novel findings were that the distribution of cancer foci within the prostate was significantly different between black and white patients, and that serum PSA levels in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were higher in black than in white men, despite adjustment for known variables affecting PSA. These observations suggest that differences in the biology of prostate cancer between these 2 races may exist.

TI  - Identification of communication apprehension in medical students starting a surgery rotation.  
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most methods used to critically evaluate young surgeons for advancement or certification in surgery require oral communication skills, eg, case and research presentations, rounds, morbidity and mortality conferences, interviews, journal clubs and oral examinations. The irony, though, is that much of surgery training focuses on technical skill lists, and the rhetorical aspects are often neglected until the surgeon encounters failure in an oral examination or is sued for not "talking" appropriately. Early identification of those at risk for difficulty with oral skills would provide programs with time needed to arrange for the appropriate types of interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify those medical students with high communication apprehension scores in dyadic, group, or public speaking situations before they encountered failure and caused problems, not only for themselves, but also for their programs and practices. METHODS: Two scales, Willingness to Communicate (WTC) and the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA-24), were administered to medical students at two large university medical centers during new student orientation to the surgery rotation. The WTC is a 20-item probability-estimate scale designed to measure one's predisposition toward approaching or avoiding the initiation of communication. The PRCA-24 is a scale designed to measure one's fear associated with either real or anticipated communication in four different contexts. In addition to the 44 items, a lengthy list of demographic items was added for possible correlations. These items were based on the student's perception of the communication or language environment in which he was raised. Therefore, a student ranked past and future socioeconomic status (eg, blue collar or white collar) according to his or her own criteria. The chairman was provided with a list of individual scores. Those students who were below the group means on skills required during a surgery rotation were identified for immediate intervention. RESULTS: The published data show a norm mean of 65.6 for PRCA-24 and 65.2 for WTC for college students. The current study found medical students to be more willing to communicate (WTC) and less anxious about communication (PRCA-24) than college students (mean 70.7 versus 65.2, P = 0.003, and 61.6 versus 65.6, P = 0.01, respectively). This difference was accentuated for blue-collar medical students compared with college students and persisted when blue-collar medical students were compared with white-collar medical students (73.9 blue-collar versus 70.9 college students, P = 0.15 for WTC, and 58.5 blue-collar versus 63.6 white-collar, P = 0.002 for PRCA-24). Male medical students were found to be less anxious about communication than female medical students. CONCLUSIONS: These instruments are easily administered at orientation and produce simple class lists with individual scores. They can be used to identify students who are below the mean for specific forms of communication before they encounter failure.

TI  -  Black-white differences in hip geometry. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group.  
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that reduced thickness of the femoral neck and shaft cortex, a wider intertrochanteric region and a longer hip axis length were predictive of hip fracture among Caucasian women. We hypothesized that racial differences in these features of hip geometry may contribute to explaining the differences in hip fracture incidence between women of African origin and Caucasian women. We measured the cortical thickness and bone widths in 132 African-American women and 43 Nigerian women who were pair-matched on height (+/- 3 cm), age (+/- 5 years) and weight (+/- 3 kg) to 175 Caucasian women. Measures of cortical thickness were greater among women of African origin than Caucasian. Women of African origin had smaller bone widths and a shorter hip axis length than Caucasians. Several of these differences were independent of bone mineral density except for the cortical thickness of the femoral shaft. We conclude that women of African origin have thicker cortical bone of the hip, a shorter hip axis length and smaller intertrochanteric widths than Caucasians. Based on a model developed from hip fractures among Caucasian women, we predict that these observed racial differences could contribute to approximately a 25% decrease risk of hip fracture among blacks.

TI  - [A case of dural arteriovenous malformation associated with progressive dementia showing marked improvement with endovascular treatment]  
AB  - An 81-year-old man was admitted with a 3-month history of progressive dementia. Neurological examination revealed marked dementia, parkinsonism and myoclonus in his extremities. His cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal. An electroencephalogram showed a mildly slowed background. Computed tomography (CT) disclosed diffuse low-density areas in bilateral cerebral white matter. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated vermiform enhancement of engorged cortical veins, suggesting increased pressure of the venous system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed diffuse high-intensity areas in bilateral cerebral white manner on T2-weighted images, and abnormal flow-voids presenting venous congestion on proton-density images. Cerebral angiography revealed arteriovenous malformation (AVM) fed by four branches of the right external carotid artery with retrograde drainage into the right transverse sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and dilated cortical veins. The ipsilateral sigmoid sinus was not visualized. After transarterial embolization, transvenous embolization of the right transverse sinus was performed. These treatments resulted in a marked clinical improvement. We emphasize the role of AVM as a cause of progressive dementia.

TI  - Gender and ethnic differences in the timing of first sexual intercourse.  
AB  - CONTEXT: Whether the effect of gender on the risk of first intercourse in influenced by adolescents ethnicity has received limited attention in research on age at first sex. Such information could provide a more complete understanding of adolescent sexual behavior. METHODS: Life-table analysis using data from a population-based, ethnically diverse sample of 87/Los Angeles County youths was employed to estimate the median age at first sex for each gender-and-ethnicity group. Multivariate analysis using proportional hazards techniques was conducted to determine the relative risk of sexual activity among teenagers in each group. RESULTS: Overall, the teenagers in the sample had a median age at first sex of 16.9 years. Black males had the lowest observed median (15.0), and Asian American males the highest (18.1); white and Hispanic males, and white and black females, reported similar ages (about 16.5 years). Hispanic and Asian American females had rates of first sex about half that of white females, although these protective effects were explained by differences in family structure. Even after controlling for background characteristics, black males had rates of first sex that were about 3-5 times the rates of the other gender-and-ethnicity groups. In addition, Asian American males were less likely than Hispanic males to be sexually experienced, and Hispanic males had almost twice the rates of sexual activity of Hispanic females. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic conditions account for ethnic differences among females in the age at first sex, and cultural influences may contribute to the difference between Hispanic males and females; explanations for black males, however, remain elusive.

TI  - Identification of one tachykinin- and two kinin-related peptides in the brain of the white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei.  
AB  - This paper reports the purification of three myotropic neuropeptides from the white shrimp Penaeus vannamei. The central nervous systems of 3500 shrimps were extracted in an acidified solvent, after which four to five HPLC column systems were used to obtain pure peptides. A cockroach hindgut muscle contraction bioassay was used to monitor all collected fractions. The pure peptides were submitted to Edman degradation based automated microsequencing. Mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis confirmed the sequences. Ala-Pro-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-Met-Arg-NH2 (Pev-tachykinin, 934.1 Da) belongs to the tachykinin family with identified members in all vertebrate classes and some invertebrate classes: arthropods, annelids and molluscs. A very specific Pev-tachykinin antiserum was developed, which labels 4 neurosecretory cells in the brain. Ala-Ser-Phe-Ser-Pro-Trp-Gly-NH2 (Pev-kinin 1, 749.8 Da) and Asp-Phe-Ser-Ala-Trp-Ala-NH2 (Pev-kinin 2, 694.7 Da) are the first crustacean kinins. Pev-kinin 2 is the first kinin with a Trp-Ala-NH2 instead of a kinin-typical Trp-Gly-NH2 carboxyterminus. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

TI  - Assessment of chest pain onset and out-of-hospital delay using standardized interview questions: the REACT Pilot Study. Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment (REACT) Study Group.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the consistency of responses to a standardized 2-part "key" question (Key-Q) about acute symptom onset in patients presenting with chest pain when measured using alternative questions (Qs) about symptom perception and decisions to seek treatment. METHODS: A structured patient interview was performed at 3 university teaching hospitals and 1 community hospital. Convenience samples of adult patients presenting to these EDs with chest pain were asked specific questions related to their symptoms and recognition of illness. Information obtained included the 2-part Key-Q: "What are the symptoms that brought you here today?" and "When did those symptoms start?" The alternative Qs (in order of use) were as follows: Q1 = "When did your very first symptom or sensation begin?"; Q2 = "When did your symptoms lead you to think something was wrong or that you were ill?"; Q3 = "When did your symptoms become serious enough for you to seek medical care?"; and Q4 = "When did you actually call 9-1-1/emergency medical services (EMS) or go to the hospital?" The documented ED arrival time, demographic variables, and whether the patient arrived by ambulance were obtained from the medical record. Patients also were queried regarding potential barriers to seeking medical care and their cardiac risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 135 patients surveyed, 9 were unsure of the date and time of symptom onset. For the 126 patients with analyzable data, the mean (+/- SD) patient age was 62 +/- 16 years, and 59% were male. The general sequence of events reported from acute symptom onset until hospital care was Q1/Key-Q-->Q2-->Q3-->Q4-->ED arrival. The median differences and interquartile ranges (IQRs) in minutes between Q times and the Key-Q response were: Q1 = 0 (0-0); Q2 = 30 (0-210); Q3 = 140 (30-720); Q4 = 265 (90-1,215); and ED arrival = 340 (120-1,230). The interval from the Key-Q response until calling 9-1-1/EMS or going to the hospital was shorter for those who used an ambulance and for those who did not consult a physician first. The interval from the Key-Q response until considering symptoms to be serious was shorter for those with a family history of heart disease, but longer for non-white patients. CONCLUSION: The Key-Q elicited a response recalled near the time of first symptoms and generally before the patient had concluded something was "wrong or that he or she was ill." Measurement of the out-of-hospital delay in chest pain patients using the Key-Q appears promising.

TI  - [The properties of the benzodiazepine receptors of the rat cerebellum 6 months after korazol-induced kindling and recurrent seizures]  
AB  - It was shown that the increased brain seizure readiness persisted within 6 months after termination of corazol kindling. Seizures of the same severity as during kindling (corazol injection in a dose of 20 mg/kg) were reproduced by corazol injection in a dose of 30 mg/kg. In contrast to the control rats, in this situation an autoenhancement of seizures was observed in the kindled animals. Acute corazol seizures induced a decrease in Bmax and Kd of 3H-diazepam binding with benzodiazepine receptors (BDR) in the cerebellum of the 10-months-old control rats white the young animals demonstrated only a decrease in Bmax of binding. In 6 months after kindling termination the BDR activity (Bmax) was reduced by one half. However, we think that the increase in Bmax is not responsible for persistence of the increased seizure readiness. It seems possible that down regulation of receptor activity develops independently of kindling but in response to long-lasting corazol application. Probably, Bmax spontaneously decreases after the termination of the long-term corazol application. The single dose of corazol (30 mg/kg) restores the changes in BDR density to the level when seizure readiness has been just fixed (6 months after kindling termination), independently of the primary receptor density.

TI  - Physicians' attire as perceived by young children and their parents: the myth of the white coat syndrome.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if young children have a preference regarding whether physicians do or do not wear a white coat. METHODS: One hundred one children, ages four to eight years, and their parents were recruited from the outpatient setting of a pediatric referral center. Two pairs of photographs, the same man with and without a white coat and the same woman with and without a white coat, were shown to the children and their parents, and both were asked which of each pair they would like to have as their or their child's doctor, respectively. Parents filled out a questionnaire rating the appropriateness of various aspects of a physician's attire and appearance. RESULTS: The children selected the person in the white coat 69% of the time. The parents also selected the white coat more often (66%). On the questionnaire parents identified a name tag as the most appropriate item of dress followed by a white coat. A groomed mustache and groomed beard were also rated favorably. Open-toed sandals, clogs, and shorts were rated negatively, while parents were neutral with respect to hospital greens, blouse and skirt or dress, and shirt and tie. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians may wear a white coat without fear that they are negatively affecting their relationship with their pediatric patients four to eight years of age. The appropriateness of wearing a name tag is confirmed.

TI  - Mammography screening and breast cancer tumor size in female members of a managed care organization.  
AB  - A study of temporal trends in mammography screening and changes in stage of disease at diagnosis was conducted among Hispanic and non-Hispanic white female members of the Lovelace Health Plan, Flexcare Plan, and Lovelace Senior Plan/Senior Options (LHP), a managed care organization. Two-year screening rates for female members ages 50-74 years were calculated for 1989-1996. From 1989-1996, mammography screening rates for non-Hispanic white female members increased from 65.5 to 71.6%, although this was not a statistically significant increase. Screening rates for Hispanic female members also increased from 50.6 to 62.7%, but they were significantly lower than for non-Hispanic white women. All breast cancers occurring among LHP female members ages 40-74 years were also identified for this same time period. A logistic regression model adjusting for age, year of diagnosis, ethnicity, and duration of enrollment prior to diagnosis found that statistically significant predictors of more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis included young age, diagnosis after 1991 for non-Hispanic white women, and diagnosis prior to 1992 for Hispanic women. Longer duration of enrollment prior to diagnosis was predictive of lower stage of disease, but the odds ratio was not statistically significant. For the time period 1992-1996, Hispanic women with breast cancer were more than twice as likely to have advanced stage of breast cancer compared with non-Hispanic white women (odds ratio, 2.12).

TI  - Phaeohyphomycosis caused by Phaeoacremonium inflatipes.  
AB  - Phaeoacremonium inflatipes, one of three species previously classified as strains of Phialophora parasitica, was identified as the causal agent of a subcutaneous infection of the left foot of an 83-year-old woman from South Carolina. The patient had a granulomatous growth over the anteromedial aspect of her left foot. It was surgically excised, which led to complete healing without complications. Tissue sections of the excised mass stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Gomori's methenamine silver strains showed many septate hyphal elements of various lengths, some exhibiting brownish pigment in the cell walls of the hyphae. Portions of the tissue, when cultured, yielded many colonies which were initially glabrous, off white becoming velvety, greyish brown on aging. Microscopically, their hyphae were septate, branched, and phaeoid and bore lateral and terminal, erect, septate conidiophores. The conidiogenous cells (phialides) were terminal or lateral, mostly monophialidic, subcylindrical to spinelike in shape, and constricted at their bases and bore funnel-shaped, inconspicuous collarettes at their tips. The conidia were subhyaline, oblong, and ellipsoid to allantoid.

TI  - Dynamic sympathetic regulation of left ventricular contractility studied in the isolated canine heart.  
AB  - We investigated the dynamic sympathetic regulation of left ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees) using an isolated canine ventricular preparation with functioning sympathetic nerves intact. We estimated the transfer function from both stellate ganglion stimulation to Ees and ganglion stimulation to heart rate (HR) for both left and right ganglia by means of the white noise approach and transformed those transfer functions into corresponding step responses. The HR response was much larger with right sympathetic stimulation than with left sympathetic stimulation (4.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.6 beats . min-1 . Hz-1, P < 0.01). In contrast, the Ees responses without pacing were not significantly different between left and right sympathetic stimulation (0.72 +/- 0.34 vs. 0.76 +/- 0. 42 mmHg . ml-1 . Hz-1). Fixed-rate pacing significantly decreased the Ees response to right sympathetic stimulation (0.53 +/- 0.43 mmHg . ml-1 . Hz-1, P < 0.01), but not to left sympathetic stimulation (0.67 +/- 0.32 mmHg . ml-1 . Hz-1, not significant). Although the mechanism by which the sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiac contractility is different depending on whether the left or right sympathetic nerves are activated, this difference does not affect the apparent response of Ees to dynamic sympathetic stimulation.

TI  - Evidence that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with an infectious agent linked to hygiene conditions [see comments]  
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children has shown temporal and geographic variation during the 20th century, with higher rates in developed nations appearing in the first half of the century, but with persisting low rates in developing nations. We sought to assess the relation of childhood ALL with hygiene conditions, an aspect of socioeconomic development affecting rates of exposure to infectious agents. METHODS: Infection patterns for hepatitis A virus (HAV), an agent with a fecal-oral route of transmission, were used to indicate hygiene conditions in different populations, with emphasis on instructive United States and Japanese data. A catalytic model was fit to these data, estimating the HAV force of infection and age-specific seroprevalence rates over time. These analyses were used to assess the temporal relationship of changes in HAV infection rates to changes in childhood leukemia mortality and incidence rates. RESULTS: We observed an inverse relationship between HAV infection prevalence and rates of childhood leukemia. Further, decreases in the HAV force of infection in the United States and Japan appear to have preceded increases in childhood leukemia rates. We describe a model based on a putative leukemia-inducing agent with a change in infection rate over time correlated with that of HAV that describes well the temporal trends in childhood leukemia rates for White children in the US and for Japanese children. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that improved public hygiene conditions, as measured by decreased prevalence of HAV infection, are associated with higher childhood ALL incidence rates. The model that we present supports the plausibility of the hypothesis that decreased childhood exposure to a leukemia-inducing agent associated with hygiene conditions leads to higher rates of ALL in children by increasing the frequency of in utero transmission caused by primary infection during pregnancy (or by increasing the number of individuals infected in early infancy because of lack of protective maternal antibodies).

TI  - Importance of TNF-alpha and leptin in obesity and insulin resistance: a hypothesis on the impact of physical exercise.  
AB  - Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of insulin resistance, dyslipoproteinemia, and hypercoagulability. In a more recently established hypothesis of body weight control and regulation of metabolism, the adipocyte secretes leptin and locally expresses TNF-alpha, the latter being responsible for the expression of metabolic cardiovascular risk factors. TNF-a mRNA expression and TNF-alpha protein are greatly increased in adipose tissue from obese animals and humans. Elevated TNF-alpha expression induces insulin resistance by downregulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and decreasing the expression of GLUT-4 glucose transporters. TNF-alpha also reduces lipoprotein lipase activity in white adipocytes, stimulates hepatic lipolysis, and increases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 content in adipocytes. Moreover, adipocytes secrete leptin, a molecule with a secondary cytokine structure whose concentrations correlate with the amount of fat tissue. Increased leptin levels downregulate appetite and increase sympathetic activity and thermogenesis in the hypothalamus. Diet-induced weight loss reduces adipose TNF-alpha expression and serum leptin levels and is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Although exercise has also been shown to reduce leptin levels, an influence on TNF-a expression in adipocytes or muscle cells has not yet been demonstrated.

TI  - Claim rates of compensable back injuries by age, gender, occupation, and industry. Do they relate to return-to-work experience? [see comments]  
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of Michigan workers' compensation cases involving back injuries in 1986 and 1987 with incidence and outcome data. OBJECTIVE: To determine claim rates by age, gender, and industry or occupation for compensable back injuries and to investigate the relation between occupation and return to work. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The cohort of 24,094 Michigan workers' compensation cases from 1986 and 1987 in which claimants were compensated for back injuries was reviewed. Compensation eligibility requires more than 7 days' disability after injury. METHODS: Claim rates for back injuries by age, gender, and industry or occupation using employment data interpolated from 1980 and 1990 Census 1% Public Use Microdata Samples. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed for return to work in the first 8 weeks after injury, with occupation coded at the three-digit level. RESULTS: All-age claim rates for Michigan compensable back injuries by occupation ranged between 0.03% and 1.7% annually (0.39% for all cases) and were generally higher in women in white collar occupations and in men in blue collar occupations. The claim rate peaked in men in the 25-34 year range, with the highest rates in manual labor occupations. The peak claim rates by age were less marked in women, tending to occur broadly throughout the 25-44-year range. Similar all-age values were recorded by industry. The male-to-female risk ratio over all occupations does not vary by age and is approximately 1.4:1. As the classification of occupation became more detailed, large differences in risk were documented within major occupation groups. The highest risk in this study was approximately 6% annually for 25-44 year old men in driver-sales (beverage truck drivers and delivery workers). Only 7 of 40 occupation categories showed a significant relative hazard for return to work in the first 8 weeks after injury, and these were blue collar occupations with earlier return than the reference sales category. For Michigan compensable back injuries, a rough estimate of the true annual incidence of new claims is 94% of the reported claim rate. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk of compensable back injury is generally higher for females in white collar occupations, higher for males in blue collar occupations and approximately equal in service occupations. Although the risk of back injury is related to occupation, the same occupational factors do not operate as a barrier to return to work.

TI  - Faecal pH, bile acid and sterol concentrations in premenopausal Indian and white vegetarians compared with white omnivores.  
AB  - Faecal bulk, pH, water content, the concentrations of neutral sterols and bile acids and dietary intakes were measured in twenty-two Indian vegetarian, twenty-two white omnivorous and eighteen white vegetarian premenopausal women. Faecal bulk and water content were greater and pH lower in the Indian vegetarians. Total faecal animal sterol and coprostanol concentrations expressed on a dry-weight basis were lower in the vegetarians compared with the omnivores. The faecal sterol concentrations were correlated with dietary cholesterol intake. Primary bile acids were detected in six Indian vegetarians, two white vegetarians and two white omnivores; secondary bile acids were detected in all the white omnivores and vegetarian subjects but not in two of the Indian vegetarians. Total faecal free bile acid and conjugated bile acid concentrations were lower in the white vegetarians compared with the omnivores. Faecal lithocholic acid concentrations were lower in both Indian and white vegetarians. The lithocholic: deoxycholic acid ratio and coprostanol: total animal sterols ratio were significantly lower in the Indian vegetarians compared with the omnivores. Both ratios were positively correlated with faecal pH. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were undertaken in order to identify which nutrients influenced faecal pH, lithocholic and deoxycholic acid concentrations. The intakes of starch and dietary fibre were negatively associated with faecal concentrations of lithocholic and deoxycholic acid. Starch intake alone was negatively associated with faecal pH. The results of this study confirm that diets high in dietary fibre decrease faecal bile acid concentrations and suggest that the complex carbohydrates present in Indian vegetarian diets influence faecal pH and inhibit the degradation of faecal steroids.

TI  - Nondermatophyte causes of onychomycosis and superficial mycoses.  
AB  - Compared to dermatophytes, nondermatophytes that may cause distal and lateral subungual onychomycoses are Aspergillus species, Acremonium species, Fusarium oxysporum and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis.  White superficial onychomycosis may be caused by nondermatophyte species, for example, Acremonium species, Aspergillus terreus, other Aspergillus species and Fusarium oxysporum. Nondermatophyte molds such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis may uncommonly result in cutaneous infections. Scytalidium dimidiatum (Scytalidium anamorph of Hendersonula toruloidea) and Scytalidium hyalinum may cause interdigital tinea pedis, and less frequently "moccasin foot" or plantar tinea pedis. Nondermatophytes have generally responded poorly to griseofulvin and ketoconazole. There have been reports of some nondermatophyte fungi responding to itraconazole and terbinafine.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of cerebral vasculopathy in patients with Fabry disease.  
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study's purpose was to obtain a quantitative natural history of the cerebrovascular involvement in Fabry disease. BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disorder due to alpha-galactosidase A deficiency. Progressive accumulation of ceramidetrihexoside within the intima and media of cerebral blood vessels causes ischemic lesions in the majority of affected patients. Determination of the natural history of the cerebral vasculopathy in Fabry disease is important to assess the effects of therapeutic intervention in this disorder. METHODS: A longitudinal MRI study of 50 patients who had a total of 129 MRI scans was performed. The burden of cerebrovascular disease was determined using direct linear measurement. RESULTS: On T2-weighted MRI scans, 32% of the patients had no lesions (mean age, 33 years), 16% had gray matter lesions only (mean age, 36 years), 26% had lesions in white matter only (mean age, 43 years), and 26% had lesions in white and gray matter (mean age, 47 years). Disease burden increased with age, but no patient younger than 26 had lesions on MRI. All patients older than 54 had cerebrovascular involvement. The distribution of MRI-detectable lesions was typical of a small-vessel disease. Only 37.5% of patients with cerebral lesions had neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a predictable outcome measure to assess the effect of molecular interventions on the cerebrovascular circulation in Fabry disease.

TI  - Molecular screening for P-element insertions in a large genomic region of Drosophila melanogaster using polymerase chain reaction mediated by the vectorette.  
AB  - As an alternative to existing methods for the detection of new insertions during a transposon mutagenesis, we adapted the method of vectorette ligation to genomic restriction fragments followed by PCR to obtain genomic sequences flanking the transposon. By combining flies containing a defined genomic transposon with an excess of flies containing unrelated insertion sites, we demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the procedure in the detection of integration events. This method was applied in a transposon-tagging screen for BJ1, the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate gene Regulator of Chromosome Condensation (RCCI). Genetic mobilization of a single genomic P element was used to generate preferentially new local insertions from which integrations into a genomic region surrounding the BJ1 gene were screened. Flies harboring new insertions were phenotypically selected on the basis of the zeste1-dependent transvection of white. We detected a single transposition to a 13-kb region close to the BJ1 gene among 6650 progeny that were analyzed. Southern analysis of the homozygous line confirmed the integration 3 kb downstream of BJ1.
