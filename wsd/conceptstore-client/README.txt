This is a client project that allows the user to use the knowledgebase as a java library.

1. Copy the knowledgebase folder to your local HDD.
2. Set the absolute path of this folder, generally called the "graph.db" in the "conceptstore-client-config.properties" located in the src/main/resources folder against the variable "graph.db". e.g. for mac users "graph.db=/Users/bhsingh/Desktop/graph.db"
3. See the SpringClient java class's "main" method on how to retrieve the graph repositories.
